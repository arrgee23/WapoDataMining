       "      <td>The European Space Agency just secured 436 million euros to send its first-ever rover to Mars in 2020.The news came as a relief to scientists behind the two-part ExoMars mission, who are still reeling after their spacecraft Schiaparelli crashed in an attempt to land on the Red Planet during the first part of the mission.But a proposal to survey a near-Earth asteroid — and eventually attempt to knock it off course — was not so lucky.Last month, more than 100 planetary scientists, engineers and physicists had signed an open letter in support of NASA and ESA's Asteroid Impact and Deflection Assessment mission, warning that humanity really needs to figure out whether we can deflect a killer asteroid before it crashes into Earth. But ESA Director General Jan Woerner said that the ESA part of the program didn't get enough backing or funding to ensure its future, although the space agency will continue to study asteroid defense in other ways.“These asteroid activities, looking at how we can really defend our planet in case something is happening and Bruce Willis is not ready to do it a second time .?.?. will be continued,” he joked to Reuters, referencing the 1998 movie “Armageddon,” in which Willis plays a driller who must save Earth from an asteroid capable of causing a mass extinction.The decision makes it even less likely that NASA will pursue its half of the mission, which would have sent a spacecraft slamming into the asteroid as ESA satellites observed the maneuver.The funding decisions came out of a two-day meeting of government ministers in Lucerne, Switzerland. Europe approved an extra 339 million euros for the ExoMars rover, and ESA said it could cobble together an additional 97 million euros by reshuffling funds internally, according to Nature.“After the many challenging, difficult and rewarding moments of 2016, this is a great relief and a fine result for European space exploration,” Don McCoy, ESA’s project manager for ExoMars, told Nature.The first half of the mission, which is a joint project of ESA and the Russian Federal Space Agency, arrived at Mars this October. It included the Trace Gas Orbiter, which will circle above the planet sniffing for gases that could be signs of habitability or even life, and the Schiaparelli lander. The latter spacecraft was primarily designed to test the technologies needed for landing — and it failed.An ESA investigation revealed that the lander misinterpreted sensor data during its descent, so it thought it was below ground level rather than two miles above it. Schiaparelli jettisoned its parachute, turned off its thrusters too early and went into a free fall before coming to a crashing halt on the Martian surface.[The Schiaparelli crash shows how difficult it is to land on Mars]It was a sadly familiar scenario. Roughly half of all Mars missions fail, and ESA had already lost one lander to the deadly descent to the surface. Prospects for the rover mission, which is already over budget and delayed from its original launch date in 2018, looked uncertain after the Schiaparelli crash.“Completion of ExoMars was probably the most challenging of our discussions because of the size of the additional resources that have been put on the table,” Roberto Battiston, president of the Italian Space Agency, told the BBC.But European ministers decided to commit to the project anyway. Engineers say they learned important lessons from the crash that will help the 2020 robot land safely on the Red Planet, where it will drill beneath the surface in search of microbes that might survive beyond the reach of deadly radiation.The ESA also committed to participating in the International Space Station until at least 2024.Read more:Elon Musk unveils Mars colonization plan, but don't pack your bags just yetNASA's Juno spacecraft may have a malfunctioning engineDear Science: How did the planets get their names?That study critiquing NASA’s ‘bad science’ on asteroids is pretty bad science</td>\n",

       "      <td>Imagine if scientists found out that a massive asteroid was on a collision course with Earth and would strike somewhere near Los Angeles by September 2020. What could humanity do?Not much. At least, that was the result of a day-long tabletop exercise coordinated by NASA and FEMA late last month. In their hypothetical scenario, the space agency concluded that the 330-foot space rock was approaching too quickly to mount a deflection mission. The team from FEMA was left to figure out how to evacuate millions of people from Southern California.This was a purely fictional exercise. NASA has discovered some 17,000 potentially hazardous near-Earth objects, but none of them is projected to come close to Earth in the next hundred years. No human that we know of has been killed by a meteorite or the effects of an impact, and the likelihood that this could happen to any of us is very, very slim. The chance of an impact big enough to destroy our planet is even smaller. Remember that Earth has suffered only one mass extinction-inducing impact that we know of in its 4.6 billion-year history, and even that asteroid didn't end life entirely. Our planet is pretty resilient.Still, plenty of researchers don't want to simply wait around and see what happens. This week, more than 100 planetary scientists, physicists and engineers published an open letter in support of a joint European Space Agency (ESA) and NASA mission to survey a near-Earth asteroid and attempt to deflect it.“Unlike other natural disasters, this is one we know how to predict and potentially prevent with early discovery,” the letter reads. “As such, it is crucial to our knowledge and understanding of asteroids to determine whether a kinetic impactor is able to deflect the orbit of such a small body, in case Earth is threatened. This is what AIDA [an Asteroid Impact and Deflection Assessment mission] will help us assess.”In early December, ESA's council of ministers will meet to decide on funding for the first half of the AIDA mission.ESA's half of the joint project with NASA is called the Asteroid Impact Mission (AIM). It would launch a spacecraft in 2020 to the Didymos asteroid and its “moonlet,” known as Didymoon. The pair of space rocks is expected to pass within 10 million miles of Earth around 2022. From an interplanetary perspective, that's a hair's breadth.The smaller of the two bodies — 550-foot wide Didymoon — is AIM's target. The spacecraft would release a probe to land on the rock's surface, as well as two satellites to orbit around it.Four months later, a NASA spacecraft would complete the second part of the mission with a Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART). With the ESA satellites watching, the DART spacecraft is scheduled to slam into Didymoon and attempt to knock it off course.Aside from demonstrating NASA's over-the-top love for acronyms, the two-part mission would provide proof-of-concept for the idea that a “kinetic impactor” can change the trajectory of a rock in space — that is, if it works. In the remote possibility that it becomes necessary, NASA might one day use this technique to shift an asteroid away from Earth's orbit.“New NEOs [near-Earth objects] are now being discovered at the rate of some four per day,” Alan Harris, a letter signatory and senior scientist at German Aerospace Center, noted at a news conference. “We need a coordinated international strategy for near-Earth object impact mitigation.”Many asteroid researchers say that the Chelyabinsk meteor strike, which injured at least 1,200 people in the Ural Mountains in Russia in 2013, was something of a wake up call. It's estimated that the rock weighed about 10 tons and was about 65 feet across when it broke up in the sky above the city of Chelyabinsk. That no one died is largely a product of the remote location and incredible luck.An analysis of the meteor published later that year suggested that dangerous strikes could be more common than many of us realized.The timing of the mission is important, AIM supporters say, because the Didymos pair's orbit won't bring it this close to Earth's again for another 100 years.“It is a very unique opportunity,” Cornelius Schalinski, deputy head of business development for OHB, a German private space company helping to implement AIM, told Space.com. “It has to go in 2020. Otherwise, the opportunity is lost. It is an asteroid that gets pretty close to Earth, so we can, with comparatively small cost and effort, test technologies that we need for future missions that are farther away.”At 250 million euros (about $265 million), AIM is considered a low-cost mission. But it faces some technical challenges. For one thing, scientists barely know anything about Didymoon's shape or composition, because its small size makes it difficult to image. The (relatively) tiny rock also has barely any gravity — according to Space.com, if you jumped on it you wouldn't come back down, but instead float off into space — making it hard to ensure a lander stays put on its surface.But ESA's recent Rosetta mission, which ended earlier this year, demonstrated that the space agency could plop a lander down on a very small body. Granted, the comet visited by Rosetta was about two miles across, not 550 feet. But the authors of the open letter say Rosetta was a big step toward what AIM hopes to achieve.Beyond demonstrating the potential for deflection, the joint ESA-NASA mission will also help scientists better understand asteroids — ancient chunks of material left over from the earliest days of the solar system.“We want to make sure that the heritage of Rosetta, in terms of technology and expertise, continues — leading to new missions and further innovation,” the letter said. “As citizens of our solar system, we need to expand our body of knowledge of the universe in which we live.”Read more:At the ‘Crater of Doom,’ geologists dig up rocks from the day the dinosaurs diedAncient Swedish space rock may be a whole new kind of meteoriteAsteroids splashed into the young moon — and they may be the source of its waterThis strange, tailless comet could teach us about Earth’s originsThis asteroid almost certainly isn't going to crash into Earth and kill us all</td>\n",

       "      <td>Update: As of 1 p.m. Eastern, scientists at European Space Operations Command received the first transmission from the Trace Gas Orbiter since it entered Mars orbit. The spacecraft is intact and seems to have completed its orbital insertion maneuver exactly according to plan. But the space agency is still waiting to hear from the Schiaparelli lander, which was scheduled to touch down at 10:48 a.m. Eastern. The spacecraft sent a communication indicating its parachutes had deployed during the descent, but the two transmissions since have been too faint or inconclusive for scientists to determine whether Schiaparelli is functional.The Schiaparelli lander, a small, saucer-shaped spacecraft equipped with an array of weather sensors, has already traveled farther than any meteorologist has ever gone. Seven months ago, it launched from a desert in Kazakhstan, and it has traveled 500 million miles to reach its current spot in the skies above Mars. On Monday, it successfully separated from its parent spacecraft, the Trace Gas Orbiter (TGO) that will relay signals from the surface and scan the red planet's atmosphere for an important signature of life.On Wednesday the intrepid spacecraft will attempt its most daring feat yet: Landing on a foreign planet, smack in the middle of a dust storm, to check out the weather up there.The orbiter and lander are part of the ExoMars mission, a joint project of the European Space Agency and the Russian Federal Space Agency aimed at assessing Mars's habitability, investigating its geology and atmosphere, searching for biosignatures, and testing the technology that will get scientists closer to examining real samples from the surface. In 2020, using data from TGO and Schiaparelli, the space agencies are scheduled to launch a rover capable of tracking down signs of past or present life on the planet — if any life ever existed.But first, the orbiter and lander need to get there.Both spacecraft are currently circling high above the planet, coasting toward the positions from which they will start their orbital insertions and landing. At 9:04 a.m. Eastern time, the TGO will begin a complex, two-hour series of engine burns designed to move it into orbit. For parts of this process, scientists on the ground will be completely out of touch with the orbiter. There is also a nine-minute time lag for communications between Earth and Mars. This means that the ExoMars team must trust in the programs it wrote for this maneuver more than a year ago.Once it has settled into orbit, TGO will spend the next six years \"sniffing\" Mars's atmosphere for gases that could tell us about conditions on the ground. Its main target is methane, a gas that has briefly, fleetingly been detected in the Martian air before. This is important because there are only two known sources of methane gas: geothermal activity, like the kind that occurs at ocean vents on Earth, or life. Either source would be of great interest to planetary scientists, since currently we have no evidence of current volcanic or biologic activity on the Mars.Shortly after TGO begins its orbital insertion, Schiaparelli will start its descent toward Mars. Over the course of the six-minute landing, it will rely on its heat shield, thrusters, a parachute and a crushable landing structure to keep it intact. It will also take a series of 15 black and white photos as it plummets toward the surface, allowing scientists to reconstruct the landing process.The ESA has produced a visualization of what Schiaparelli's descent will look like. It will also broadcast a live stream of the orbital entry and landings starting at 8 a.m. Eastern.If everything goes according to plan, Schiaparelli will be the first successful Mars landing for the European and Russian space agencies (previous attempts have failed to make it to the Red Planet or were unable to communicate once they got there).The lander lacks a rechargeable battery, so it has just a few days to collect all the data it needs. It will be touching down in the middle of the Martian dust-storm season, in a desolate plain marked by impact craters, volcanic rock and rare crystals of hematite that (on Earth, at least) usually form in the presence of liquid water.Schiaparelli's primary goal is to demonstrate the technologies needed for landing, but it carries a small suite of scientific instruments that will study things like wind speed, temperature, dust and other weather-related phenomena that will be needed to plan the second round of ExoMars missions.The landing will be “our own six minutes of terror,\" Francesca Ferri, a planetary scientist at the University of Padua in Italy, told Nature. She was referencing a phrase used to describe the landing of NASA’s Curiosity rover in 2012.“Around 50 percent of the landings on Mars haven’t succeeded, so it’s not easy,\" said Ferri, the principal investigator for an experiment that will study atmospheric data gathered during Schiaparelli's descent. \"But I’m feeling pretty confident.\"Read more:Dear Science: How did the planets get their names?The universe may have 10 times as many galaxies as we thoughtA comet smashing into ancient Earth may have set off catastrophic global warmingElon Musk unveils Mars colonization plan, but don't pack your bags just yet</td>\n",

       "      <td>A meteor blast over Russia is putting new focus on a transatlantic effort to crash a spacecraft into a far-flung asteroid in a bid to prove that incoming objects from space can be knocked from their path.Researchers from Johns Hopkins University’s Applied Physics Laboratory are preparing a decade-long, $350 million project to propel a rocket into the asteroid Didymos as it passes close to Earth. If successful, it would be the first time an asteroid is knocked off course by human intervention.“There is a science aspect to it and a planetary defense aspect to it,” Andy Cheng, the chief scientist of the physics laboratory in Laurel, said in an interview.Cheng said he developed a plan for a lower-cost test for smacking an asteroid as a way to revive a shelved European effort. In a sign of the steep odds it faced, the initial European plan was called Don Quijote, named after the fictional Spanish knight who tussled with windmills he thought to be giants.The conceptual study has support from NASA and the European Space Agency. They jointly published an initial plan for the project in May. If the plan goes forward, NASA would help Cheng’s group fund and launch “the impactor.” The ESA, which announced this month a call for research ideas on the mission, would launch a second spacecraft to assess the impact and its effect. Defense of the planet against asteroids, a longtime focus of former astronauts, astronomers and amateur hobbyists, became the topic of worldwide discussions recently as the largest meteor to explode near Earth in a century blew out windows and injured 1,200 near the city of Chelyabinsk in central Russia, near the border with Kazakhstan.The meteor blast over the Chelyabinsk region, which has a population of 3.6 million people, was the largest recorded since one flattened more than 800 square miles of Siberian forest in 1908.The object entered the atmosphere at 9:20 a.m. local time Feb. 15, hours before an unrelated asteroid half the length of a football field hurtled past Earth.The twin punch, which scientists said was coincidental, served as a warning that space continues to hold dangers for humankind. A space object, if it is big enough and hits in the right spot, could destroy a city or worse. Scientists blame an asteroid more than six miles in diameter for wiping out the dinosaurs 66 million years ago.Cheng describes his project as straightforward. Didymos, Greek for “twin,” is actually two asteroids in one: a larger object with a smaller, moonlike rock circling it. And it is predicted to pass 6.5 million miles from Earth in 2022.In 2021, Cheng’s laboratory would launch a spacecraft into the path of the smaller of the two bodies, which is 492 feet in diameter. Cheng expects the collision to knock the smaller asteroid from its established path around the larger one, an impact that he said can be charted from high-powered telescopes on Earth.By targeting the smaller member of the “binary system,” the mission would produce “an orbital deflection which is both larger and easier to measure” than if it hit an asteroid circling the sun, according to the ESA’s preliminary report last year.“It is important to note that the target Didymos is not an Earth-crossing asteroid, and there is no prospect that the deflection experiment would create an impact hazard,” the agency said in its report, which Cheng helped draft.Finding asteroids is not just about danger; it is also about research. Cheng said the second spacecraft would measure the crater caused by the crash and look for additional details about the composition and nature of the asteroid.“You have to do something pretty spectacular to move it,” Cheng said. — Bloomberg Government Related storiesVIDEO: The asteroid that could have wiped out WashingtonCrater found in Iowa points to asteroid break-up 470 million years agoAs asteroid whizzes by, surprise meteor makes an impact</td>\n",

What could humanity do?Not much. At least, that was the result of a day-long tabletop exercise coordinated by NASA and FEMA late last month. In their hypothetical scenario, the space agency concluded that the 330-foot space rock was approaching too quickly to mount a deflection mission. The team from FEMA was left to figure out how to evacuate millions of people from Southern California.This was a purely fictional exercise. NASA has discovered some 17,000 potentially hazardous near-Earth objects, but none of them is projected to come close to Earth in the next hundred years. No human that we know of has been killed by a meteorite or the effects of an impact, and the likelihood that this could happen to any of us is very, very slim. The chance of an impact big enough to destroy our planet is even smaller. Remember that Earth has suffered only one mass extinction-inducing impact that we know of in its 4.6 billion-year history, and even that asteroid didn't end life entirely. Our planet is pretty resilient.Still, plenty of researchers don't want to simply wait around and see what happens. This week, more than 100 planetary scientists, physicists and engineers published an open letter in support of a joint European Space Agency (ESA) and NASA mission to survey a near-Earth asteroid and attempt to deflect it.“Unlike other natural disasters, this is one we know how to predict and potentially prevent with early discovery,” the letter reads. “As such, it is crucial to our knowledge and understanding of asteroids to determine whether a kinetic impactor is able to deflect the orbit of such a small body, in case Earth is threatened. This is what AIDA [an Asteroid Impact and Deflection Assessment mission] will help us assess.”In early December, ESA's council of ministers will meet to decide on funding for the first half of the AIDA mission.ESA's half of the joint project with NASA is called the Asteroid Impact Mission (AIM). It would launch a spacecraft in 2020 to the Didymos asteroid and its “moonlet,” known as Didymoon. The pair of space rocks is expected to pass within 10 million miles of Earth around 2022. From an interplanetary perspective, that's a hair's breadth.The smaller of the two bodies — 550-foot wide Didymoon — is AIM's target. The spacecraft would release a probe to land on the rock's surface, as well as two satellites to orbit around it.Four months later, a NASA spacecraft would complete the second part of the mission with a Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART). With the ESA satellites watching, the DART spacecraft is scheduled to slam into Didymoon and attempt to knock it off course.Aside from demonstrating NASA's over-the-top love for acronyms, the two-part mission would provide proof-of-concept for the idea that a “kinetic impactor” can change the trajectory of a rock in space — that is, if it works. In the remote possibility that it becomes necessary, NASA might one day use this technique to shift an asteroid away from Earth's orbit.“New NEOs [near-Earth objects] are now being discovered at the rate of some four per day,” Alan Harris, a letter signatory and senior scientist at German Aerospace Center, noted at a news conference. “We need a coordinated international strategy for near-Earth object impact mitigation.”Many asteroid researchers say that the Chelyabinsk meteor strike, which injured at least 1,200 people in the Ural Mountains in Russia in 2013, was something of a wake up call. It's estimated that the rock weighed about 10 tons and was about 65 feet across when it broke up in the sky above the city of Chelyabinsk. That no one died is largely a product of the remote location and incredible luck.An analysis of the meteor published later that year suggested that dangerous strikes could be more common than many of us realized.The timing of the mission is important, AIM supporters say, because the Didymos pair's orbit won't bring it this close to Earth's again for another 100 years.“It is a very unique opportunity,” Cornelius Schalinski, deputy head of business development for OHB, a German private space company helping to implement AIM, told Space.com. “It has to go in 2020. Otherwise, the opportunity is lost. It is an asteroid that gets pretty close to Earth, so we can, with comparatively small cost and effort, test technologies that we need for future missions that are farther away.”At 250 million euros (about $265 million), AIM is considered a low-cost mission. But it faces some technical challenges. For one thing, scientists barely know anything about Didymoon's shape or composition, because its small size makes it difficult to image. The (relatively) tiny rock also has barely any gravity — according to Space.com, if you jumped on it you wouldn't come back down, but instead float off into space — making it hard to ensure a lander stays put on its surface.But ESA's recent Rosetta mission, which ended earlier this year, demonstrated that the space agency could plop a lander down on a very small body. Granted, the comet visited by Rosetta was about two miles across, not 550 feet. But the authors of the open letter say Rosetta was a big step toward what AIM hopes to achieve.Beyond demonstrating the potential for deflection, the joint ESA-NASA mission will also help scientists better understand asteroids — ancient chunks of material left over from the earliest days of the solar system.“We want to make sure that the heritage of Rosetta, in terms of technology and expertise, continues — leading to new missions and further innovation,” the letter said. “As citizens of our solar system, we need to expand our body of knowledge of the universe in which we live.”Read more:At the ‘Crater of Doom,’ geologists dig up rocks from the day the dinosaurs diedAncient Swedish space rock may be a whole new kind of meteoriteAsteroids splashed into the young moon — and they may be the source of its waterThis strange, tailless comet could teach us about Earth’s originsThis asteroid almost certainly isn't going to crash into Earth and kill us all</td>\n",

       "      <td>This story has been updated.Scientists at the European Space Agency downplayed the likely loss of its Mars lander, saying Thursday that a wealth of data sent back by the experimental probe would help them prepare for a future mission to the Red Planet.The Schiaparelli lander was designed mainly to test technology for a European robotic mission to Mars in 2020 and avoid the fate of Europe’s Beagle 2 probe, which failed to deploy after landing in 2003.Data received from Schiaparelli show that it entered the atmosphere as planned Wednesday and used its parachute to successfully slow down in the harsh Martian atmosphere, but its signal was lost shortly before the expected touchdown.Experts said the probe may have descended too fast or too slowly and hoped that about 600 megabytes of data sent back to Earth would provide answers. The data are equivalent to about 400,000 pages of information for scientists to sift through.“The experimental test has yielded a huge amount of data and clearly we’re going to have to analyze this in the days and weeks to come, but it gives us a lot of confidence for the future,” said David Parker, ESA’s director of human spaceflight and robotic exploration.“We need to understand what happened in the last few seconds before the planned landing and that is likely to take some time,” he said.Getting a spacecraft onto the surface of Mars is notoriously difficult, and the planet is littered with the remains of failed attempts. Only NASA has repeatedly succeeded in landing several robotic vehicles on the planet, including the Opportunity and Curiosity rovers.The apparent failure to achieve what rocket scientists call a “soft landing” marred an otherwise successful start to the ExoMars mission, a joint venture between ESA and Russian space agency Roscosmos.ESA chief Jan Woerner noted that Schiaparelli’s mother ship was put into orbit around Mars as planned. The Trace Gas Orbiter will analyze the atmosphere to help determine whether there is life on Mars.ESA’s member states are expected to decide in the coming months whether to pay the estimated $330 million needed for the second part of the ExoMars mission in 2020.Scientists haven’t given up all hope that Schiaparelli might yet phone home. Don McCoy, the manager of the ExoMars project, said attempts will be made to reset the probe’s transceiver but noted that its batteries are only expected to last for a few days.Parker said his team was undaunted by the fate of Schiaparelli.“Mars exploration is hard, and that’s one of the reasons we do it,” he said.</td>\n",

       "      <td>This post has been updated. The ExoMars Schiaparelli lander — a European and Russian robot that was slated to touch down on Mars on Wednesday — probably crashed during landing, early telemetry data suggests.According to the European Space Agency, radio signals from the spacecraft that were picked up by an Earth telescope and a Mars orbiter suggest that Schiaparelli performed most of its six-minute descent maneuver according to plan. But sometime after deploying its parachute and heat shield, just before touching down, the lander stopped communicating. It hasn't been heard from since.The ESA hasn't conceded that the spacecraft did not achieve its planned “soft landing,” but the outlook is not good.The lander would have been the first operable spacecraft from either the European Space Agency or the Russian Federal Space Agency to successfully land on Mars. It is part of the ExoMars astrobiology mission, which also put a satellite into orbit around the Red Planet on Wednesday.Telemetry data beamed to Earth from Schiaparelli's sister spacecraft, the Trace Gas Orbiter, suggests that the lander may have jettisoned its heat shield too soon. It also seems that Schiaparelli's thrusters, which were supposed to slow its descent, were turned off earlier than expected.The ESA may try to call out to the probe in hopes that it is intact and capable of responding. But Jonathan Amos, a journalist from the BBC who was at ESA Mission Control in Darmstadt, Germany, reported that the mood there is grim.“Many scientists here at mission control have taken all this information to mean one thing,” he wrote, “that the probe crashed at high speed. It is likely it went into freefall a kilometer or two above the surface.”The news comes after a long day and anxious night of waitingThe Schiaparelli lander was able to muster a hazy transmission during its descent, letting engineers know that its parachutes had deployed. But then, nothing. For several tense hours, telescopes around the globe were trained toward Mars, each listening for a faint signal from the newest arrival on the planet. Just before noon Eastern, ESA's Mars Express orbiter began transmitting a packet of data from the lander back to scientists on Earth; that recording was inconclusive. A few hours after that, NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter passed over the spot where Schiaparelli was to have landed and did not pick up a signal.“The tension mounts: Has Schiaparelli fallen victim to the Great Galactic Ghoul, Mars-probe predator since the 1960s?” astronomer Jonathan McDowell wondered on Twitter on Wednesday. The ghoul — which supposedly roams the darkness between Earth and its neighbor, snapping up hapless spacecraft attempting to reach Mars — is a joke invented in 1964 to explain why so many Mars missions fail.The uncertainty overshadowed the successful orbital insertion of the Trace Gas Orbiter (TGO). The maneuver was conducted on the far side of the planet, out of reach of Earth-based telescopes. But just before 1 p.m., the TGO pulled out of Mars's shadow and sent its first transmission home. Initial checks on the spacecraft's health looked positive, and about 3 p.m., ESA confirmed that everything had gone according to plan.Currently, there are five orbiters (NASA's Mars Odyssey, Mars Reconnaissance and MAVEN orbiters, ESA's Mars Express and the Indian Space Research Organization's Mars Orbiter Mission) and two rovers (NASA's Opportunity and Curiosity) operating on the Red Planet.There are also carcasses of dozens of expired and unsuccessful missions littering the terrain. Among them is the Beagle 2 lander, which the ESA landed on the planet in 2003 but never heard from again. More than a decade later, images from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter confirmed that the Beagle 2 had failed to deploy its solar panels and antenna.That breakdown underscores how rare successful landings are. More than 50 percent of all missions to Mars have resulted in lost spacecraft, crash landing, failed batteries and a host of other disasters.The ESA and RFSA hope that understanding which of these problems befell Schiaparelli might help them achieve their first successful Mars landing when they launch a rover in a few years.“Schiaparelli’s primary role was to test European landing technologies,” Jan Wörner, ESA’s director general, said in a statement. “Recording the data during the descent was part of that, and it is important we can learn what happened, in order to prepare for the future.”The primary scientific instruments for the mission are all on board the TGO, which will spend the next several years scanning the Martian skies for methane and other vital gases that could be signatures of life. (You can read more about ExoMars's scientific goals here.)But the lander's failure may bode poorly for the planned second phase of the ExoMars mission: The rover that is slated to launch in 2020. That project already has been postponed by two years (it was originally scheduled for 2018) and still needs to secure at least a couple hundred million Euros in additional funding. The likely failure of the Schiaparelli landing won't make it any easier to win support and financial backing for the beleaguered 1.2 billion Euro mission.But speaking to the media Thursday morning, officials at ESA were determined to keep it upbeat. The TGO's orbital insertion was picture-perfect, and the crash landing can be, well, a learning opportunity.“Following yesterday’s events we have an impressive orbiter around Mars ready for science and for relay support for the ExoMars rover mission in 2020,” Wörner said in a statement.Read more:Dear Science: How did the planets get their names?The universe may have 10 times as many galaxies as we thoughtA comet smashing into ancient Earth may have set off catastrophic global warmingElon Musk unveils Mars colonization plan, but don't pack your bags just yet</td>\n",

       "      <td>The day Gil Levin says he detected life on Mars, he was waiting in his lab at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, watching a piece of paper inch out of a printer.Levin snatched the sheet and scrutinized the freshly inked graph. A thin line measuring radioactive carbon crept steadily upward, just as it always did when Levin performed the test with microbes on Earth. But this data came from tens of millions of miles away, where NASA's Viking lander was — for the first time in history — conducting an experiment on the surface of Mars.\"Gil, that's life,\" his co-investigator, Patricia Straat, exclaimed when she saw the first results come in. There was jubilation at JPL. Afterward, Levin said, he drove into the mountains above Los Angeles, sat on the ground and stared up at the night sky.\"I was sort of trembling, you know?\" he recalled. It was July 30, 1976.Forty years later, Levin and Straat still believe that their experiment was evidence of microbiotic Martians. But few people agree with them. To NASA, and to most scientists, the 1976 Viking mission was a technical triumph but a biological bust. Scientists, such as Carl Sagan, who had wagered that large organisms \"are not only possible on Mars; they may be favored,\" were disappointed to see images the lander sent back of a dry, barren planet. Two experiments aimed at finding life turned up negative, and NASA concluded that the results of Levin's test, called the Labeled Release experiment, could be explained by chemical processes rather than biological ones.“I was sort of set aback,” recalled NASA chief astrobiologist Penny Boston, who was still in college at the time. “I was thinking, ‘Gosh, I want to work in exobiology, as we called it at the time, and now it seems like it’s just a pile of rocks, and there’s no life there at all.'”Viking put a 20-year damper on Mars exploration. Even when NASA did return to the Red Planet, it completely quit trying to test for living organisms directly.But hope was in the air at Langley Research Center last week, where NASA held a two-day conference to honor the 40th anniversary of the Viking landing. After decades of pointedly not looking for it, the space agency is more optimistic than it's been since 1976 that it might find life on Mars yet.\"Every new piece of information we get about the planet seems to point to greater and greater habitability,\" Boston said. \"It just seems more and more likely.\"The issue with the Viking experiments is that they expected to find too much too soon, speaker after speaker explained over the course of the conference. Detecting life with Viking would have been a breakthrough of unprecedented proportions, and science doesn't usually happen that way. Most \"breakthroughs\" come after years of accumulating incremental increases in knowledge.So, for the past four decades, \"we’ve engaged in creeping up on the problem,\" Boston said. Some evidence in favor of a livable Mars came from the same mission that seemed to quash the possibility: Viking itself. While the two landers relayed bleak photos and disappointing data from the surface, the orbiters that were launched along with them revealed landscapes that looked strikingly like ones on our own planet.Ellen Stofan, now NASA's chief scientist, was then a summer intern at JPL assigned to map Mangala Valles, a system of crisscrossing channels near Mars's equator.\"What was so fascinating were all these features that were so familiar from our studies of the Earth,\" she recalled. \"Things like teardrop-shaped islands, abandoned oxbow sections of channels, features that by looking at rivers on Earth we could understand that these features on Mars had been carved by water, and in some cases by great floods of water, coursing across the Martian surface.\"Images from the Viking orbiters confirmed what the Mariner 9 satellite found when it arrived at the planet five years earlier: Mars once had water, a key ingredient for the evolution of life as we know it. But that water existed hundreds of millions, perhaps even billions, of years ago, offering little promise that organisms might still exist.Today, the space agency has two rovers and three active satellites surveying the planet. Among them is the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) a bulky spacecraft shaped like a metal water bird that flew into Mars orbit in 2006.In the fall, NASA announced that photos from MRO showing dark, tendril-like formations called recurring slope lineae were actually evidence of liquid water on the planet's surface. It's only a tiny amount, and only appears under specific circumstances, but \"it's really important from a scientific point of view,\" Stofan said last week. \"... If there's life on Mars, that's probably the environment in which we would find it.\"Other spacecraft have uncovered organic compounds in Martian soil and fluctuating levels of methane, which is usually a biological byproduct, in the atmosphere. Mars may be a frigid, atmosphere-less, radiation-bombarded desert, but it is slightly less of an inhospitable wasteland than the version Viking first captured 40 years ago.Meanwhile, here on Earth, scientists have begun to realize that even apparent \"wastelands\" aren't as inhospitable as they seem.When Viking landed in 1976, our understanding of the capacities and diversity of microscopic life was fairly limited. Most microbiological knowledge came from medicine, in which scientists focused on the bacteria that lived in our bodies or infected them.\"It’s almost like we were looking for a gut bacteria on Mars,\" Boston said. \"We were naive, really, about the capabilities of microbes and what you need to do to find them.\" But a year after the Viking experiments, divers discovered bizarre creatures living in the dark, toxic waters around hydrothermal vents at the bottom of the Pacific — the first organisms capable of making a living off chemicals, rather than sunlight. Scientists have also found microrganisms deep within the oceanic crust and high up in the stratosphere.Boston herself, who spent 30 years studying life in caves before being appointed director of NASA's Astrobiology Institute this year, has discovered microbes that can metabolize minerals in dark cracks in the earth. Similar environments — lava tubes, the bottoms of lake beds, rock overhangs, tiny cavities in the soil — exist on Mars and would offer protection from the planet's frigid climate and punishing solar radiation.\"That's where I want to go look,\" she said.This kind of talk is frustrating for Levin, who has held for 30 years that life on Mars has already been detected. At the anniversary event Wednesday, he exhorted the audience, \"there is no scientifically acceptable explanation to the Labeled Release experiments on Mars, except life.\"Off stage, Levin admitted he was surprised he was invited to speak at the conference (when he announced his opinion at the 10th anniversary celebration, he says he was pelted with shrimp).“I’m very glad because I was invited, despite this long convolution of disagreements. I kind of hope it means they’re beginning to consider the experiment again,\" he said. In a statement, Walt Engelund, the director of the Space Technology and Exploration Directorate at NASA Langley, said there was no \"implicit motivation\" in inviting Levin. He was an integral part of the mission's science team, and merited a chance to \"discuss and defend his own perspectives,\" Engelund said.But it is true that NASA is gearing up to start a more focused search for Martians past and present. The last decade and a half of Mars exploration has focused on \"following the water\" to identify spots where the Red Planet might potentially be habitable.\"It's a much more sophisticated approach,\" Boston said. \"We’re trying to map out the parameters that we know are conducive to life surviving — and it’s a whole lot more work than we realized.\" (Levin, ever impatient, scoffed at that excuse.)A new rover scheduled to launch in 2020 will carry several instruments aimed</td>\n",

       "      <td>Imagine if scientists found out that a massive asteroid was on a collision course with Earth and would strike somewhere near Los Angeles by September 2020. What could humanity do?Not much. At least, that was the result of a day-long tabletop exercise coordinated by NASA and FEMA late last month. In their hypothetical scenario, the space agency concluded that the 330-foot space rock was approaching too quickly to mount a deflection mission. The team from FEMA was left to figure out how to evacuate millions of people from Southern California.This was a purely fictional exercise. NASA has discovered some 17,000 potentially hazardous near-Earth objects, but none of them is projected to come close to Earth in the next hundred years. No human that we know of has been killed by a meteorite or the effects of an impact, and the likelihood that this could happen to any of us is very, very slim. The chance of an impact big enough to destroy our planet is even smaller. Remember that Earth has suffered only one mass extinction-inducing impact that we know of in its 4.6 billion-year history, and even that asteroid didn't end life entirely. Our planet is pretty resilient.Still, plenty of researchers don't want to simply wait around and see what happens. This week, more than 100 planetary scientists, physicists and engineers published an open letter in support of a joint European Space Agency (ESA) and NASA mission to survey a near-Earth asteroid and attempt to deflect it.“Unlike other natural disasters, this is one we know how to predict and potentially prevent with early discovery,” the letter reads. “As such, it is crucial to our knowledge and understanding of asteroids to determine whether a kinetic impactor is able to deflect the orbit of such a small body, in case Earth is threatened. This is what AIDA [an Asteroid Impact and Deflection Assessment mission] will help us assess.”In early December, ESA's council of ministers will meet to decide on funding for the first half of the AIDA mission.ESA's half of the joint project with NASA is called the Asteroid Impact Mission (AIM). It would launch a spacecraft in 2020 to the Didymos asteroid and its “moonlet,” known as Didymoon. The pair of space rocks is expected to pass within 10 million miles of Earth around 2022. From an interplanetary perspective, that's a hair's breadth.The smaller of the two bodies — 550-foot wide Didymoon — is AIM's target. The spacecraft would release a probe to land on the rock's surface, as well as two satellites to orbit around it.Four months later, a NASA spacecraft would complete the second part of the mission with a Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART). With the ESA satellites watching, the DART spacecraft is scheduled to slam into Didymoon and attempt to knock it off course.Aside from demonstrating NASA's over-the-top love for acronyms, the two-part mission would provide proof-of-concept for the idea that a “kinetic impactor” can change the trajectory of a rock in space — that is, if it works. In the remote possibility that it becomes necessary, NASA might one day use this technique to shift an asteroid away from Earth's orbit.“New NEOs [near-Earth objects] are now being discovered at the rate of some four per day,” Alan Harris, a letter signatory and senior scientist at German Aerospace Center, noted at a news conference. “We need a coordinated international strategy for near-Earth object impact mitigation.”Many asteroid researchers say that the Chelyabinsk meteor strike, which injured at least 1,200 people in the Ural Mountains in Russia in 2013, was something of a wake up call. It's estimated that the rock weighed about 10 tons and was about 65 feet across when it broke up in the sky above the city of Chelyabinsk. That no one died is largely a product of the remote location and incredible luck.An analysis of the meteor published later that year suggested that dangerous strikes could be more common than many of us realized.The timing of the mission is important, AIM supporters say, because the Didymos pair's orbit won't bring it this close to Earth's again for another 100 years.“It is a very unique opportunity,” Cornelius Schalinski, deputy head of business development for OHB, a German private space company helping to implement AIM, told Space.com. “It has to go in 2020. Otherwise, the opportunity is lost. It is an asteroid that gets pretty close to Earth, so we can, with comparatively small cost and effort, test technologies that we need for future missions that are farther away.”At 250 million euros (about $265 million), AIM is considered a low-cost mission. But it faces some technical challenges. For one thing, scientists barely know anything about Didymoon's shape or composition, because its small size makes it difficult to image. The (relatively) tiny rock also has barely any gravity — according to Space.com, if you jumped on it you wouldn't come back down, but instead float off into space — making it hard to ensure a lander stays put on its surface.But ESA's recent Rosetta mission, which ended earlier this year, demonstrated that the space agency could plop a lander down on a very small body. Granted, the comet visited by Rosetta was about two miles across, not 550 feet. But the authors of the open letter say Rosetta was a big step toward what AIM hopes to achieve.Beyond demonstrating the potential for deflection, the joint ESA-NASA mission will also help scientists better understand asteroids — ancient chunks of material left over from the earliest days of the solar system.“We want to make sure that the heritage of Rosetta, in terms of technology and expertise, continues — leading to new missions and further innovation,” the letter said. “As citizens of our solar system, we need to expand our body of knowledge of the universe in which we live.”Read more:At the ‘Crater of Doom,’ geologists dig up rocks from the day the dinosaurs diedAncient Swedish space rock may be a whole new kind of meteoriteAsteroids splashed into the young moon — and they may be the source of its waterThis strange, tailless comet could teach us about Earth’s originsThis asteroid almost certainly isn't going to crash into Earth and kill us all</td>\n",

       "      <td>It was a day when the Earth was caught in a cosmic crossfire. The big rock came from the south, the smaller one from the east. They were unrelated objects, with different orbits, one the size of an apartment building, the other slimmer but with better aim.The larger asteroid missed by 17,000 miles, as expected, but the Russian meteor stole the show Friday, fireballing across the Ural Mountains in spectacular fashion and exploding into fragments, creating a powerful shock wave that blew out windows, collapsed roofs and injured 1,200 people, mostly from broken glass. It was surely the most thoroughly documented meteor in human history — captured by countless crack-of-dawn Russian drivers who own dashboard cameras.The spectacle capped an extraordinary day for the planet. The object, which exploded over the industrial city of Chelyabinsk, caused the largest such impact in more than a century and was the first to inflict significant human casualties, with at least 48 victims hospitalized.The asteroid that was supposed to show up Friday, the much-hyped 2012 DA14, passed by harmlessly, just as the experts had promised it would.But they had no way of seeing the other rock heading toward Russia. The explanation from NASA scientists, when asked why they hadn’t spotted it, boiled down to two simple facts: It was small, and the sun was in their eyes.“This was the largest object observed to hit the Earth since 1908,” said Margaret Campbell-Brown, an astronomer at the University of Western Ontario. That’s when another space rock exploded over Siberia, leveling 800 square miles of forest in what became known as the Tunguska event.On Friday, a global network of sensors recorded the space rock’s object’s descent and revealed its stunning power. It measured about 50 feet wide, weighed more than a nuclear-powered submarine and screamed in at 40,000 miles per hour, said Campbell-Brown, who examined data from sonic sensors deployed by the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization to detect nuclear detonations.In its 30-second shallow-angle dive into the thickening atmosphere, the meteor shed energy equivalent to more than 20 Hiroshima-size atomic bombs. Most of that energy was dissipated many miles above the surface, and, in a sense, the atmosphere saved the day, preventing catastrophic damage from a major surface impact.Initial estimates from Russian authorities sketched a much smaller and weaker object, but scientists say the nuclear-sensor network provides the best measure an incoming asteroid’s size and power.Intense heat and pressure shattered the object into dozens of large pieces during its descent. Russian officials said they believed they had identified meteorite fragments on the ground 50 miles west of Chelyabinsk and had reports of pieces stretched out over another 75 miles.Searchers also found a circular hole in the ice, 15 to 20 feet across, in a lake west of Chelyabinsk, and roped it off.A transcript from a meeting of Russian emergency officials indicated about 3,000 buildings suffered damage.The region’s governor, Mikhail Yurevich, said the biggest worry after the incident was the cold, with single-digit temperatures forecast overnight. “Our main task now is to preserve the heat in offices and homes where windows were shattered, to prevent the heating system from freezing,” he said.Chelyabinsk, a city of 1.1 million people, has a high concentration of defense industries, and arsenals in its vicinity have occasionally exploded, but the meteor’s arrival appears not to have set off any. The roof of a zinc factory, however, came crashing down, triggering a spike in global zinc prices.Russian President Vladimir Putin said, “Thank God no large objects fell in populated areas. However, there were still people who were injured.” The Interior Ministry, meanwhile, mobilized 10,000 police to deal with the incident.The event immediately generated conspiracy theories. One anti-Western member of Russia’s parliament, Vladimir Zhirinovsky, claimed that the meteor was actually a U.S. weapons test.Scientists say the object was instead a small asteroid. NASA’s Bill Cooke said it flew in from the asteroid belt, a band of space rocks circling the sun beyond Mars and the source of all near-Earth asteroids.History has recorded occasional injuries from meteorites, but the number hurt Friday is unprecedented, said Timothy McCoy, who studies meteorites at the Smithsonian’s National Museum of Natural History. “I can’t think of a burst this size over a city before,” he said.Amateur footage showed at least two orange flashes as the meteor streaked over apartment buildings. A series of booms trailed the space rock. As it exploded, the meteor briefly blazed brighter than the sun.And no one saw it coming.A weather satellite’s camera snapped the meteor’s dive, but a global network of asteroid-spotting telescopes funded by NASA failed to detect it. The sun was in the way, the telescopes blinded by a dayside approach.“An asteroid such as this is virtually impossible to see ahead of time,” said Paul Chodas of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif.The twin asteroid encounters on Friday — one benign, the other malign — laid bare both the uncertain reality of life in the cosmos — you never know when a space rock might come crashing down — and our planet’s lack of defense against such threats.NASA, the world’s lead agency for detecting asteroid hazards, boosted its budget for the task from $6 million in 2011 to $21 million last year. And a NASA effort launched in 1998 has found 95 percent of potential “planet killers” at least a mile wide; none is headed for Earth. But still, many say the agency, and the world, are not doing enough.Two congressmen seized the moment to promise hearings on the planet’s space-threat readiness. Lamar Smith (R-Tex.), chairman of the House Science, Space and Technology Committee, said in a statement that developing technology to track asteroids “is critical to our future,” while Dana Rohrabacher (R-Calif.) called asteroid impacts the “only true preventable natural disaster.” Even if we find one that will hit us, he said, “we might not be able to deflect it.”A private effort by two former astronauts to build a space telescope to spot smaller Earth-bound asteroids has raised a few million dollars, but is years away from launch — if it ever gets off the ground.Plans to deflect asteroids are even more nascent. Proposals range from the sublime — spraying an asteroid with reflective paint so the sun nudges it — to the extreme — nuking it. With early detection and a few decades of lead time, even a tiny nudge could push an asteroid out of the tiny “keyhole” in space that would otherwise send it crashing to Earth.The European Space Agency and NASA are in the early stages of plotting a mission to smash a spacecraft into an asteroid to see if humans can, in fact, push around a sizeable space rock. The project, called AIM-DART, has no timeline and no real budget.In another cosmic coincidence, three of the nation’s top asteroid trackers met in Vienna on Friday with international counterparts under the auspices of the United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space to better coordinate planetary defense.“This is a what-sort-of-things-are-we-doing-to-protect-the-Earth meeting,” said Timothy Spahr, director of the Minor Planet Center at Harvard University, the international clearinghouse for asteroid tracking. He said enthusiasm for building a better detection network runs high among the attendees from dozens of nations.As for meeting on the day when the reality of extraterrestrial threats burst into view over Russia, Spahr said, “Yeah, pretty crazy timing.”Englund reported from Moscow.

       "      <td>This post has been updated. The ExoMars Schiaparelli lander — a European and Russian robot that was slated to touch down on Mars on Wednesday — probably crashed during landing, early telemetry data suggests.According to the European Space Agency, radio signals from the spacecraft that were picked up by an Earth telescope and a Mars orbiter suggest that Schiaparelli performed most of its six-minute descent maneuver according to plan. But sometime after deploying its parachute and heat shield, just before touching down, the lander stopped communicating. It hasn't been heard from since.The ESA hasn't conceded that the spacecraft did not achieve its planned “soft landing,” but the outlook is not good.The lander would have been the first operable spacecraft from either the European Space Agency or the Russian Federal Space Agency to successfully land on Mars. It is part of the ExoMars astrobiology mission, which also put a satellite into orbit around the Red Planet on Wednesday.Telemetry data beamed to Earth from Schiaparelli's sister spacecraft, the Trace Gas Orbiter, suggests that the lander may have jettisoned its heat shield too soon. It also seems that Schiaparelli's thrusters, which were supposed to slow its descent, were turned off earlier than expected.The ESA may try to call out to the probe in hopes that it is intact and capable of responding. But Jonathan Amos, a journalist from the BBC who was at ESA Mission Control in Darmstadt, Germany, reported that the mood there is grim.“Many scientists here at mission control have taken all this information to mean one thing,” he wrote, “that the probe crashed at high speed. It is likely it went into freefall a kilometer or two above the surface.”The news comes after a long day and anxious night of waitingThe Schiaparelli lander was able to muster a hazy transmission during its descent, letting engineers know that its parachutes had deployed. But then, nothing. For several tense hours, telescopes around the globe were trained toward Mars, each listening for a faint signal from the newest arrival on the planet. Just before noon Eastern, ESA's Mars Express orbiter began transmitting a packet of data from the lander back to scientists on Earth; that recording was inconclusive. A few hours after that, NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter passed over the spot where Schiaparelli was to have landed and did not pick up a signal.“The tension mounts: Has Schiaparelli fallen victim to the Great Galactic Ghoul, Mars-probe predator since the 1960s?” astronomer Jonathan McDowell wondered on Twitter on Wednesday. The ghoul — which supposedly roams the darkness between Earth and its neighbor, snapping up hapless spacecraft attempting to reach Mars — is a joke invented in 1964 to explain why so many Mars missions fail.The uncertainty overshadowed the successful orbital insertion of the Trace Gas Orbiter (TGO). The maneuver was conducted on the far side of the planet, out of reach of Earth-based telescopes. But just before 1 p.m., the TGO pulled out of Mars's shadow and sent its first transmission home. Initial checks on the spacecraft's health looked positive, and about 3 p.m., ESA confirmed that everything had gone according to plan.Currently, there are five orbiters (NASA's Mars Odyssey, Mars Reconnaissance and MAVEN orbiters, ESA's Mars Express and the Indian Space Research Organization's Mars Orbiter Mission) and two rovers (NASA's Opportunity and Curiosity) operating on the Red Planet.There are also carcasses of dozens of expired and unsuccessful missions littering the terrain. Among them is the Beagle 2 lander, which the ESA landed on the planet in 2003 but never heard from again. More than a decade later, images from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter confirmed that the Beagle 2 had failed to deploy its solar panels and antenna.That breakdown underscores how rare successful landings are. More than 50 percent of all missions to Mars have resulted in lost spacecraft, crash landing, failed batteries and a host of other disasters.The ESA and RFSA hope that understanding which of these problems befell Schiaparelli might help them achieve their first successful Mars landing when they launch a rover in a few years.“Schiaparelli’s primary role was to test European landing technologies,” Jan Wörner, ESA’s director general, said in a statement. “Recording the data during the descent was part of that, and it is important we can learn what happened, in order to prepare for the future.”The primary scientific instruments for the mission are all on board the TGO, which will spend the next several years scanning the Martian skies for methane and other vital gases that could be signatures of life. (You can read more about ExoMars's scientific goals here.)But the lander's failure may bode poorly for the planned second phase of the ExoMars mission: The rover that is slated to launch in 2020. That project already has been postponed by two years (it was originally scheduled for 2018) and still needs to secure at least a couple hundred million Euros in additional funding. The likely failure of the Schiaparelli landing won't make it any easier to win support and financial backing for the beleaguered 1.2 billion Euro mission.But speaking to the media Thursday morning, officials at ESA were determined to keep it upbeat. The TGO's orbital insertion was picture-perfect, and the crash landing can be, well, a learning opportunity.“Following yesterday’s events we have an impressive orbiter around Mars ready for science and for relay support for the ExoMars rover mission in 2020,” Wörner said in a statement.Read more:Dear Science: How did the planets get their names?The universe may have 10 times as many galaxies as we thoughtA comet smashing into ancient Earth may have set off catastrophic global warmingElon Musk unveils Mars colonization plan, but don't pack your bags just yet</td>\n",

Data suggests that parachute and the spacecraft’s heat shield were successfully deployed and discarded before the final phase of the landing.

       "      <td>Update: As of 1 p.m. Eastern, scientists at European Space Operations Command received the first transmission from the Trace Gas Orbiter since it entered Mars orbit. The spacecraft is intact and seems to have completed its orbital insertion maneuver exactly according to plan. But the space agency is still waiting to hear from the Schiaparelli lander, which was scheduled to touch down at 10:48 a.m. Eastern. The spacecraft sent a communication indicating its parachutes had deployed during the descent, but the two transmissions since have been too faint or inconclusive for scientists to determine whether Schiaparelli is functional.The Schiaparelli lander, a small, saucer-shaped spacecraft equipped with an array of weather sensors, has already traveled farther than any meteorologist has ever gone. Seven months ago, it launched from a desert in Kazakhstan, and it has traveled 500 million miles to reach its current spot in the skies above Mars. On Monday, it successfully separated from its parent spacecraft, the Trace Gas Orbiter (TGO) that will relay signals from the surface and scan the red planet's atmosphere for an important signature of life.On Wednesday the intrepid spacecraft will attempt its most daring feat yet: Landing on a foreign planet, smack in the middle of a dust storm, to check out the weather up there.The orbiter and lander are part of the ExoMars mission, a joint project of the European Space Agency and the Russian Federal Space Agency aimed at assessing Mars's habitability, investigating its geology and atmosphere, searching for biosignatures, and testing the technology that will get scientists closer to examining real samples from the surface. In 2020, using data from TGO and Schiaparelli, the space agencies are scheduled to launch a rover capable of tracking down signs of past or present life on the planet — if any life ever existed.But first, the orbiter and lander need to get there.Both spacecraft are currently circling high above the planet, coasting toward the positions from which they will start their orbital insertions and landing. At 9:04 a.m. Eastern time, the TGO will begin a complex, two-hour series of engine burns designed to move it into orbit. For parts of this process, scientists on the ground will be completely out of touch with the orbiter. There is also a nine-minute time lag for communications between Earth and Mars. This means that the ExoMars team must trust in the programs it wrote for this maneuver more than a year ago.Once it has settled into orbit, TGO will spend the next six years \"sniffing\" Mars's atmosphere for gases that could tell us about conditions on the ground. Its main target is methane, a gas that has briefly, fleetingly been detected in the Martian air before. This is important because there are only two known sources of methane gas: geothermal activity, like the kind that occurs at ocean vents on Earth, or life. Either source would be of great interest to planetary scientists, since currently we have no evidence of current volcanic or biologic activity on the Mars.Shortly after TGO begins its orbital insertion, Schiaparelli will start its descent toward Mars. Over the course of the six-minute landing, it will rely on its heat shield, thrusters, a parachute and a crushable landing structure to keep it intact. It will also take a series of 15 black and white photos as it plummets toward the surface, allowing scientists to reconstruct the landing process.The ESA has produced a visualization of what Schiaparelli's descent will look like. It will also broadcast a live stream of the orbital entry and landings starting at 8 a.m. Eastern.If everything goes according to plan, Schiaparelli will be the first successful Mars landing for the European and Russian space agencies (previous attempts have failed to make it to the Red Planet or were unable to communicate once they got there).The lander lacks a rechargeable battery, so it has just a few days to collect all the data it needs. It will be touching down in the middle of the Martian dust-storm season, in a desolate plain marked by impact craters, volcanic rock and rare crystals of hematite that (on Earth, at least) usually form in the presence of liquid water.Schiaparelli's primary goal is to demonstrate the technologies needed for landing, but it carries a small suite of scientific instruments that will study things like wind speed, temperature, dust and other weather-related phenomena that will be needed to plan the second round of ExoMars missions.The landing will be “our own six minutes of terror,\" Francesca Ferri, a planetary scientist at the University of Padua in Italy, told Nature. She was referencing a phrase used to describe the landing of NASA’s Curiosity rover in 2012.“Around 50 percent of the landings on Mars haven’t succeeded, so it’s not easy,\" said Ferri, the principal investigator for an experiment that will study atmospheric data gathered during Schiaparelli's descent. \"But I’m feeling pretty confident.\"Read more:Dear Science: How did the planets get their names?The universe may have 10 times as many galaxies as we thoughtA comet smashing into ancient Earth may have set off catastrophic global warmingElon Musk unveils Mars colonization plan, but don't pack your bags just yet</td>\n",

The team from FEMA was left to figure out how to evacuate millions of people from Southern California.This was a purely fictional exercise. NASA has discovered some 17,000 potentially hazardous near-Earth objects, but none of them is projected to come close to Earth in the next hundred years. No human that we know of has been killed by a meteorite or the effects of an impact, and the likelihood that this could happen to any of us is very, very slim. The chance of an impact big enough to destroy our planet is even smaller. Remember that Earth has suffered only one mass extinction-inducing impact that we know of in its 4.6 billion-year history, and even that asteroid didn't end life entirely. Our planet is pretty resilient.Still, plenty of researchers don't want to simply wait around and see what happens. This week, more than 100 planetary scientists, physicists and engineers published an open letter in support of a joint European Space Agency (ESA) and NASA mission to survey a near-Earth asteroid and attempt to deflect it.“Unlike other natural disasters, this is one we know how to predict and potentially prevent with early discovery,” the letter reads. “As such, it is crucial to our knowledge and understanding of asteroids to determine whether a kinetic impactor is able to deflect the orbit of such a small body, in case Earth is threatened. This is what AIDA [an Asteroid Impact and Deflection Assessment mission] will help us assess.”In early December, ESA's council of ministers will meet to decide on funding for the first half of the AIDA mission.ESA's half of the joint project with NASA is called the Asteroid Impact Mission (AIM). It would launch a spacecraft in 2020 to the Didymos asteroid and its “moonlet,” known as Didymoon. The pair of space rocks is expected to pass within 10 million miles of Earth around 2022. From an interplanetary perspective, that's a hair's breadth.The smaller of the two bodies — 550-foot wide Didymoon — is AIM's target. The spacecraft would release a probe to land on the rock's surface, as well as two satellites to orbit around it.Four months later, a NASA spacecraft would complete the second part of the mission with a Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART). With the ESA satellites watching, the DART spacecraft is scheduled to slam into Didymoon and attempt to knock it off course.Aside from demonstrating NASA's over-the-top love for acronyms, the two-part mission would provide proof-of-concept for the idea that a “kinetic impactor” can change the trajectory of a rock in space — that is, if it works. In the remote possibility that it becomes necessary, NASA might one day use this technique to shift an asteroid away from Earth's orbit.“New NEOs [near-Earth objects] are now being discovered at the rate of some four per day,” Alan Harris, a letter signatory and senior scientist at German Aerospace Center, noted at a news conference. “We need a coordinated international strategy for near-Earth object impact mitigation.”Many asteroid researchers say that the Chelyabinsk meteor strike, which injured at least 1,200 people in the Ural Mountains in Russia in 2013, was something of a wake up call. It's estimated that the rock weighed about 10 tons and was about 65 feet across when it broke up in the sky above the city of Chelyabinsk. That no one died is largely a product of the remote location and incredible luck.An analysis of the meteor published later that year suggested that dangerous strikes could be more common than many of us realized.The timing of the mission is important, AIM supporters say, because the Didymos pair's orbit won't bring it this close to Earth's again for another 100 years.“It is a very unique opportunity,” Cornelius Schalinski, deputy head of business development for OHB, a German private space company helping to implement AIM, told Space.com. “It has to go in 2020. Otherwise, the opportunity is lost. It is an asteroid that gets pretty close to Earth, so we can, with comparatively small cost and effort, test technologies that we need for future missions that are farther away.”At 250 million euros (about $265 million), AIM is considered a low-cost mission. But it faces some technical challenges. For one thing, scientists barely know anything about Didymoon's shape or composition, because its small size makes it difficult to image. The (relatively) tiny rock also has barely any gravity — according to Space.com, if you jumped on it you wouldn't come back down, but instead float off into space — making it hard to ensure a lander stays put on its surface.But ESA's recent Rosetta mission, which ended earlier this year, demonstrated that the space agency could plop a lander down on a very small body. Granted, the comet visited by Rosetta was about two miles across, not 550 feet. But the authors of the open letter say Rosetta was a big step toward what AIM hopes to achieve.Beyond demonstrating the potential for deflection, the joint ESA-NASA mission will also help scientists better understand asteroids — ancient chunks of material left over from the earliest days of the solar system.“We want to make sure that the heritage of Rosetta, in terms of technology and expertise, continues — leading to new missions and further innovation,” the letter said. “As citizens of our solar system, we need to expand our body of knowledge of the universe in which we live.”Read more:At the ‘Crater of Doom,’ geologists dig up rocks from the day the dinosaurs diedAncient Swedish space rock may be a whole new kind of meteoriteAsteroids splashed into the young moon — and they may be the source of its waterThis strange, tailless comet could teach us about Earth’s originsThis asteroid almost certainly isn't going to crash into Earth and kill us all</td>\n",

       "798   Imagine if scientists found out that a massive asteroid was on a collision course with Earth and would strike somewhere near Los Angeles by September 2020. What could humanity do?Not much. At least, that was the result of a day-long tabletop exercise coordinated by NASA and FEMA late last month. In their hypothetical scenario, the space agency concluded that the 330-foot space rock was approaching too quickly to mount a deflection mission. The team from FEMA was left to figure out how to evacuate millions of people from Southern California.This was a purely fictional exercise. NASA has discovered some 17,000 potentially hazardous near-Earth objects, but none of them is projected to come close to Earth in the next hundred years. No human that we know of has been killed by a meteorite or the effects of an impact, and the likelihood that this could happen to any of us is very, very slim. The chance of an impact big enough to destroy our planet is even smaller. Remember that Earth has suffered only one mass extinction-inducing impact that we know of in its 4.6 billion-year history, and even that asteroid didn't end life entirely. Our planet is pretty resilient.Still, plenty of researchers don't want to simply wait around and see what happens. This week, more than 100 planetary scientists, physicists and engineers published an open letter in support of a joint European Space Agency (ESA) and NASA mission to survey a near-Earth asteroid and attempt to deflect it.“Unlike other natural disasters, this is one we know how to predict and potentially prevent with early discovery,” the letter reads. “As such, it is crucial to our knowledge and understanding of asteroids to determine whether a kinetic impactor is able to deflect the orbit of such a small body, in case Earth is threatened. This is what AIDA [an Asteroid Impact and Deflection Assessment mission] will help us assess.”In early December, ESA's council of ministers will meet to decide on funding for the first half of the AIDA mission.ESA's half of the joint project with NASA is called the Asteroid Impact Mission (AIM). It would launch a spacecraft in 2020 to the Didymos asteroid and its “moonlet,” known as Didymoon. The pair of space rocks is expected to pass within 10 million miles of Earth around 2022. From an interplanetary perspective, that's a hair's breadth.The smaller of the two bodies — 550-foot wide Didymoon — is AIM's target. The spacecraft would release a probe to land on the rock's surface, as well as two satellites to orbit around it.Four months later, a NASA spacecraft would complete the second part of the mission with a Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART). With the ESA satellites watching, the DART spacecraft is scheduled to slam into Didymoon and attempt to knock it off course.Aside from demonstrating NASA's over-the-top love for acronyms, the two-part mission would provide proof-of-concept for the idea that a “kinetic impactor” can change the trajectory of a rock in space — that is, if it works. In the remote possibility that it becomes necessary, NASA might one day use this technique to shift an asteroid away from Earth's orbit.“New NEOs [near-Earth objects] are now being discovered at the rate of some four per day,” Alan Harris, a letter signatory and senior scientist at German Aerospace Center, noted at a news conference. “We need a coordinated international strategy for near-Earth object impact mitigation.”Many asteroid researchers say that the Chelyabinsk meteor strike, which injured at least 1,200 people in the Ural Mountains in Russia in 2013, was something of a wake up call. It's estimated that the rock weighed about 10 tons and was about 65 feet across when it broke up in the sky above the city of Chelyabinsk. That no one died is largely a product of the remote location and incredible luck.An analysis of the meteor published later that year suggested that dangerous strikes could be more common than many of us realized.The timing of the mission is important, AIM supporters say, because the Didymos pair's orbit won't bring it this close to Earth's again for another 100 years.“It is a very unique opportunity,” Cornelius Schalinski, deputy head of business development for OHB, a German private space company helping to implement AIM, told Space.com. “It has to go in 2020. Otherwise, the opportunity is lost. It is an asteroid that gets pretty close to Earth, so we can, with comparatively small cost and effort, test technologies that we need for future missions that are farther away.”At 250 million euros (about $265 million), AIM is considered a low-cost mission. But it faces some technical challenges. For one thing, scientists barely know anything about Didymoon's shape or composition, because its small size makes it difficult to image. The (relatively) tiny rock also has barely any gravity — according to Space.com, if you jumped on it you wouldn't come back down, but instead float off into space — making it hard to ensure a lander stays put on its surface.But ESA's recent Rosetta mission, which ended earlier this year, demonstrated that the space agency could plop a lander down on a very small body. Granted, the comet visited by Rosetta was about two miles across, not 550 feet. But the authors of the open letter say Rosetta was a big step toward what AIM hopes to achieve.Beyond demonstrating the potential for deflection, the joint ESA-NASA mission will also help scientists better understand asteroids — ancient chunks of material left over from the earliest days of the solar system.“We want to make sure that the heritage of Rosetta, in terms of technology and expertise, continues — leading to new missions and further innovation,” the letter said. “As citizens of our solar system, we need to expand our body of knowledge of the universe in which we live.”Read more:At the ‘Crater of Doom,’ geologists dig up rocks from the day the dinosaurs diedAncient Swedish space rock may be a whole new kind of meteoriteAsteroids splashed into the young moon — and they may be the source of its waterThis strange, tailless comet could teach us about Earth’s originsThis asteroid almost certainly isn't going to crash into Earth and kill us all                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",
       "1270  Update: As of 1 p.m. Eastern, scientists at European Space Operations Command received the first transmission from the Trace Gas Orbiter since it entered Mars orbit. The spacecraft is intact and seems to have completed its orbital insertion maneuver exactly according to plan. But the space agency is still waiting to hear from the Schiaparelli lander, which was scheduled to touch down at 10:48 a.m. Eastern. The spacecraft sent a communication indicating its parachutes had deployed during the descent, but the two transmissions since have been too faint or inconclusive for scientists to determine whether Schiaparelli is functional.The Schiaparelli lander, a small, saucer-shaped spacecraft equipped with an array of weather sensors, has already traveled farther than any meteorologist has ever gone. Seven months ago, it launched from a desert in Kazakhstan, and it has traveled 500 million miles to reach its current spot in the skies above Mars. On Monday, it successfully separated from its parent spacecraft, the Trace Gas Orbiter (TGO) that will relay signals from the surface and scan the red planet's atmosphere for an important signature of life.On Wednesday the intrepid spacecraft will attempt its most daring feat yet: Landing on a foreign planet, smack in the middle of a dust storm, to check out the weather up there.The orbiter and lander are part of the ExoMars mission, a joint project of the European Space Agency and the Russian Federal Space Agency aimed at assessing Mars's habitability, investigating its geology and atmosphere, searching for biosignatures, and testing the technology that will get scientists closer to examining real samples from the surface. In 2020, using data from TGO and Schiaparelli, the space agencies are scheduled to launch a rover capable of tracking down signs of past or present life on the planet — if any life ever existed.But first, the orbiter and lander need to get there.Both spacecraft are currently circling high above the planet, coasting toward the positions from which they will start their orbital insertions and landing. At 9:04 a.m. Eastern time, the TGO will begin a complex, two-hour series of engine burns designed to move it into orbit. For parts of this process, scientists on the ground will be completely out of touch with the orbiter. There is also a nine-minute time lag for communications between Earth and Mars. This means that the ExoMars team must trust in the programs it wrote for this maneuver more than a year ago.Once it has settled into orbit, TGO will spend the next six years \"sniffing\" Mars's atmosphere for gases that could tell us about conditions on the ground. Its main target is methane, a gas that has briefly, fleetingly been detected in the Martian air before. This is important because there are only two known sources of methane gas: geothermal activity, like the kind that occurs at ocean vents on Earth, or life. Either source would be of great interest to planetary scientists, since currently we have no evidence of current volcanic or biologic activity on the Mars.Shortly after TGO begins its orbital insertion, Schiaparelli will start its descent toward Mars. Over the course of the six-minute landing, it will rely on its heat shield, thrusters, a parachute and a crushable landing structure to keep it intact. It will also take a series of 15 black and white photos as it plummets toward the surface, allowing scientists to reconstruct the landing process.The ESA has produced a visualization of what Schiaparelli's descent will look like. It will also broadcast a live stream of the orbital entry and landings starting at 8 a.m. Eastern.If everything goes according to plan, Schiaparelli will be the first successful Mars landing for the European and Russian space agencies (previous attempts have failed to make it to the Red Planet or were unable to communicate once they got there).The lander lacks a rechargeable battery, so it has just a few days to collect all the data it needs. It will be touching down in the middle of the Martian dust-storm season, in a desolate plain marked by impact craters, volcanic rock and rare crystals of hematite that (on Earth, at least) usually form in the presence of liquid water.Schiaparelli's primary goal is to demonstrate the technologies needed for landing, but it carries a small suite of scientific instruments that will study things like wind speed, temperature, dust and other weather-related phenomena that will be needed to plan the second round of ExoMars missions.The landing will be “our own six minutes of terror,\" Francesca Ferri, a planetary scientist at the University of Padua in Italy, told Nature. She was referencing a phrase used to describe the landing of NASA’s Curiosity rover in 2012.“Around 50 percent of the landings on Mars haven’t succeeded, so it’s not easy,\" said Ferri, the principal investigator for an experiment that will study atmospheric data gathered during Schiaparelli's descent. \"But I’m feeling pretty confident.\"Read more:Dear Science: How did the planets get their names?The universe may have 10 times as many galaxies as we thoughtA comet smashing into ancient Earth may have set off catastrophic global warmingElon Musk unveils Mars colonization plan, but don't pack your bags just yet                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",
       "1752  Imagine if scientists found out that a massive asteroid was on a collision course with Earth and would strike somewhere near Los Angeles by September 2020. What could humanity do?Not much. At least, that was the result of a day-long tabletop exercise coordinated by NASA and FEMA late last month. In their hypothetical scenario, the space agency concluded that the 330-foot space rock was approaching too quickly to mount a deflection mission. The team from FEMA was left to figure out how to evacuate millions of people from Southern California.This was a purely fictional exercise. NASA has discovered some 17,000 potentially hazardous near-Earth objects, but none of them is projected to come close to Earth in the next hundred years. No human that we know of has been killed by a meteorite or the effects of an impact, and the likelihood that this could happen to any of us is very, very slim. The chance of an impact big enough to destroy our planet is even smaller. Remember that Earth has suffered only one mass extinction-inducing impact that we know of in its 4.6 billion-year history, and even that asteroid didn't end life entirely. Our planet is pretty resilient.Still, plenty of researchers don't want to simply wait around and see what happens. This week, more than 100 planetary scientists, physicists and engineers published an open letter in support of a joint European Space Agency (ESA) and NASA mission to survey a near-Earth asteroid and attempt to deflect it.“Unlike other natural disasters, this is one we know how to predict and potentially prevent with early discovery,” the letter reads. “As such, it is crucial to our knowledge and understanding of asteroids to determine whether a kinetic impactor is able to deflect the orbit of such a small body, in case Earth is threatened. This is what AIDA [an Asteroid Impact and Deflection Assessment mission] will help us assess.”In early December, ESA's council of ministers will meet to decide on funding for the first half of the AIDA mission.ESA's half of the joint project with NASA is called the Asteroid Impact Mission (AIM). It would launch a spacecraft in 2020 to the Didymos asteroid and its “moonlet,” known as Didymoon. The pair of space rocks is expected to pass within 10 million miles of Earth around 2022. From an interplanetary perspective, that's a hair's breadth.The smaller of the two bodies — 550-foot wide Didymoon — is AIM's target. The spacecraft would release a probe to land on the rock's surface, as well as two satellites to orbit around it.Four months later, a NASA spacecraft would complete the second part of the mission with a Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART). With the ESA satellites watching, the DART spacecraft is scheduled to slam into Didymoon and attempt to knock it off course.Aside from demonstrating NASA's over-the-top love for acronyms, the two-part mission would provide proof-of-concept for the idea that a “kinetic impactor” can change the trajectory of a rock in space — that is, if it works. In the remote possibility that it becomes necessary, NASA might one day use this technique to shift an asteroid away from Earth's orbit.“New NEOs [near-Earth objects] are now being discovered at the rate of some four per day,” Alan Harris, a letter signatory and senior scientist at German Aerospace Center, noted at a news conference. “We need a coordinated international strategy for near-Earth object impact mitigation.”Many asteroid researchers say that the Chelyabinsk meteor strike, which injured at least 1,200 people in the Ural Mountains in Russia in 2013, was something of a wake up call. It's estimated that the rock weighed about 10 tons and was about 65 feet across when it broke up in the sky above the city of Chelyabinsk. That no one died is largely a product of the remote location and incredible luck.An analysis of the meteor published later that year suggested that dangerous strikes could be more common than many of us realized.The timing of the mission is important, AIM supporters say, because the Didymos pair's orbit won't bring it this close to Earth's again for another 100 years.“It is a very unique opportunity,” Cornelius Schalinski, deputy head of business development for OHB, a German private space company helping to implement AIM, told Space.com. “It has to go in 2020. Otherwise, the opportunity is lost. It is an asteroid that gets pretty close to Earth, so we can, with comparatively small cost and effort, test technologies that we need for future missions that are farther away.”At 250 million euros (about $265 million), AIM is considered a low-cost mission. But it faces some technical challenges. For one thing, scientists barely know anything about Didymoon's shape or composition, because its small size makes it difficult to image. The (relatively) tiny rock also has barely any gravity — according to Space.com, if you jumped on it you wouldn't come back down, but instead float off into space — making it hard to ensure a lander stays put on its surface.But ESA's recent Rosetta mission, which ended earlier this year, demonstrated that the space agency could plop a lander down on a very small body. Granted, the comet visited by Rosetta was about two miles across, not 550 feet. But the authors of the open letter say Rosetta was a big step toward what AIM hopes to achieve.Beyond demonstrating the potential for deflection, the joint ESA-NASA mission will also help scientists better understand asteroids — ancient chunks of material left over from the earliest days of the solar system.“We want to make sure that the heritage of Rosetta, in terms of technology and expertise, continues — leading to new missions and further innovation,” the letter said. “As citizens of our solar system, we need to expand our body of knowledge of the universe in which we live.”Read more:At the ‘Crater of Doom,’ geologists dig up rocks from the day the dinosaurs diedAncient Swedish space rock may be a whole new kind of meteoriteAsteroids splashed into the young moon — and they may be the source of its waterThis strange, tailless comet could teach us about Earth’s originsThis asteroid almost certainly isn't going to crash into Earth and kill us all                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",
       "2290  A meteor blast over Russia is putting new focus on a transatlantic effort to crash a spacecraft into a far-flung asteroid in a bid to prove that incoming objects from space can be knocked from their path.Researchers from Johns Hopkins University’s Applied Physics Laboratory are preparing a decade-long, $350 million project to propel a rocket into the asteroid Didymos as it passes close to Earth. If successful, it would be the first time an asteroid is knocked off course by human intervention.“There is a science aspect to it and a planetary defense aspect to it,” Andy Cheng, the chief scientist of the physics laboratory in Laurel, said in an interview.Cheng said he developed a plan for a lower-cost test for smacking an asteroid as a way to revive a shelved European effort. In a sign of the steep odds it faced, the initial European plan was called Don Quijote, named after the fictional Spanish knight who tussled with windmills he thought to be giants.The conceptual study has support from NASA and the European Space Agency. They jointly published an initial plan for the project in May. If the plan goes forward, NASA would help Cheng’s group fund and launch “the impactor.” The ESA, which announced this month a call for research ideas on the mission, would launch a second spacecraft to assess the impact and its effect. Defense of the planet against asteroids, a longtime focus of former astronauts, astronomers and amateur hobbyists, became the topic of worldwide discussions recently as the largest meteor to explode near Earth in a century blew out windows and injured 1,200 near the city of Chelyabinsk in central Russia, near the border with Kazakhstan.The meteor blast over the Chelyabinsk region, which has a population of 3.6 million people, was the largest recorded since one flattened more than 800 square miles of Siberian forest in 1908.The object entered the atmosphere at 9:20 a.m. local time Feb. 15, hours before an unrelated asteroid half the length of a football field hurtled past Earth.The twin punch, which scientists said was coincidental, served as a warning that space continues to hold dangers for humankind. A space object, if it is big enough and hits in the right spot, could destroy a city or worse. Scientists blame an asteroid more than six miles in diameter for wiping out the dinosaurs 66 million years ago.Cheng describes his project as straightforward. Didymos, Greek for “twin,” is actually two asteroids in one: a larger object with a smaller, moonlike rock circling it. And it is predicted to pass 6.5 million miles from Earth in 2022.In 2021, Cheng’s laboratory would launch a spacecraft into the path of the smaller of the two bodies, which is 492 feet in diameter. Cheng expects the collision to knock the smaller asteroid from its established path around the larger one, an impact that he said can be charted from high-powered telescopes on Earth.By targeting the smaller member of the “binary system,” the mission would produce “an orbital deflection which is both larger and easier to measure” than if it hit an asteroid circling the sun, according to the ESA’s preliminary report last year.“It is important to note that the target Didymos is not an Earth-crossing asteroid, and there is no prospect that the deflection experiment would create an impact hazard,” the agency said in its report, which Cheng helped draft.Finding asteroids is not just about danger; it is also about research. Cheng said the second spacecraft would measure the crater caused by the crash and look for additional details about the composition and nature of the asteroid.“You have to do something pretty spectacular to move it,” Cheng said. — Bloomberg Government Related storiesVIDEO: The asteroid that could have wiped out WashingtonCrater found in Iowa points to asteroid break-up 470 million years agoAs asteroid whizzes by, surprise meteor makes an impact                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",
       "2669  Imagine if scientists found out that a massive asteroid was on a collision course with Earth and would strike somewhere near Los Angeles by September 2020. What could humanity do?Not much. At least, that was the result of a day-long tabletop exercise coordinated by NASA and FEMA late last month. In their hypothetical scenario, the space agency concluded that the 330-foot space rock was approaching too quickly to mount a deflection mission. The team from FEMA was left to figure out how to evacuate millions of people from Southern California.This was a purely fictional exercise. NASA has discovered some 17,000 potentially hazardous near-Earth objects, but none of them is projected to come close to Earth in the next hundred years. No human that we know of has been killed by a meteorite or the effects of an impact, and the likelihood that this could happen to any of us is very, very slim. The chance of an impact big enough to destroy our planet is even smaller. Remember that Earth has suffered only one mass extinction-inducing impact that we know of in its 4.6 billion-year history, and even that asteroid didn't end life entirely. Our planet is pretty resilient.Still, plenty of researchers don't want to simply wait around and see what happens. This week, more than 100 planetary scientists, physicists and engineers published an open letter in support of a joint European Space Agency (ESA) and NASA mission to survey a near-Earth asteroid and attempt to deflect it.“Unlike other natural disasters, this is one we know how to predict and potentially prevent with early discovery,” the letter reads. “As such, it is crucial to our knowledge and understanding of asteroids to determine whether a kinetic impactor is able to deflect the orbit of such a small body, in case Earth is threatened. This is what AIDA [an Asteroid Impact and Deflection Assessment mission] will help us assess.”In early December, ESA's council of ministers will meet to decide on funding for the first half of the AIDA mission.ESA's half of the joint project with NASA is called the Asteroid Impact Mission (AIM). It would launch a spacecraft in 2020 to the Didymos asteroid and its “moonlet,” known as Didymoon. The pair of space rocks is expected to pass within 10 million miles of Earth around 2022. From an interplanetary perspective, that's a hair's breadth.The smaller of the two bodies — 550-foot wide Didymoon — is AIM's target. The spacecraft would release a probe to land on the rock's surface, as well as two satellites to orbit around it.Four months later, a NASA spacecraft would complete the second part of the mission with a Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART). With the ESA satellites watching, the DART spacecraft is scheduled to slam into Didymoon and attempt to knock it off course.Aside from demonstrating NASA's over-the-top love for acronyms, the two-part mission would provide proof-of-concept for the idea that a “kinetic impactor” can change the trajectory of a rock in space — that is, if it works. In the remote possibility that it becomes necessary, NASA might one day use this technique to shift an asteroid away from Earth's orbit.“New NEOs [near-Earth objects] are now being discovered at the rate of some four per day,” Alan Harris, a letter signatory and senior scientist at German Aerospace Center, noted at a news conference. “We need a coordinated international strategy for near-Earth object impact mitigation.”Many asteroid researchers say that the Chelyabinsk meteor strike, which injured at least 1,200 people in the Ural Mountains in Russia in 2013, was something of a wake up call. It's estimated that the rock weighed about 10 tons and was about 65 feet across when it broke up in the sky above the city of Chelyabinsk. That no one died is largely a product of the remote location and incredible luck.An analysis of the meteor published later that year suggested that dangerous strikes could be more common than many of us realized.The timing of the mission is important, AIM supporters say, because the Didymos pair's orbit won't bring it this close to Earth's again for another 100 years.“It is a very unique opportunity,” Cornelius Schalinski, deputy head of business development for OHB, a German private space company helping to implement AIM, told Space.com. “It has to go in 2020. Otherwise, the opportunity is lost. It is an asteroid that gets pretty close to Earth, so we can, with comparatively small cost and effort, test technologies that we need for future missions that are farther away.”At 250 million euros (about $265 million), AIM is considered a low-cost mission. But it faces some technical challenges. For one thing, scientists barely know anything about Didymoon's shape or composition, because its small size makes it difficult to image. The (relatively) tiny rock also has barely any gravity — according to Space.com, if you jumped on it you wouldn't come back down, but instead float off into space — making it hard to ensure a lander stays put on its surface.But ESA's recent Rosetta mission, which ended earlier this year, demonstrated that the space agency could plop a lander down on a very small body. Granted, the comet visited by Rosetta was about two miles across, not 550 feet. But the authors of the open letter say Rosetta was a big step toward what AIM hopes to achieve.Beyond demonstrating the potential for deflection, the joint ESA-NASA mission will also help scientists better understand asteroids — ancient chunks of material left over from the earliest days of the solar system.“We want to make sure that the heritage of Rosetta, in terms of technology and expertise, continues — leading to new missions and further innovation,” the letter said. “As citizens of our solar system, we need to expand our body of knowledge of the universe in which we live.”Read more:At the ‘Crater of Doom,’ geologists dig up rocks from the day the dinosaurs diedAncient Swedish space rock may be a whole new kind of meteoriteAsteroids splashed into the young moon — and they may be the source of its waterThis strange, tailless comet could teach us about Earth’s originsThis asteroid almost certainly isn't going to crash into Earth and kill us all                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",

The spacecraft would release a probe to land on the rock's surface, as well as two satellites to orbit around it.Four months later, a NASA spacecraft would complete the second part of the mission with a Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART). With the ESA satellites watching, the DART spacecraft is scheduled to slam into Didymoon and attempt to knock it off course.Aside from demonstrating NASA's over-the-top love for acronyms, the two-part mission would provide proof-of-concept for the idea that a “kinetic impactor” can change the trajectory of a rock in space — that is, if it works. In the remote possibility that it becomes necessary, NASA might one day use this technique to shift an asteroid away from Earth's orbit.“New NEOs [near-Earth objects] are now being discovered at the rate of some four per day,” Alan Harris, a letter signatory and senior scientist at German Aerospace Center, noted at a news conference. “We need a coordinated international strategy for near-Earth object impact mitigation.”Many asteroid researchers say that the Chelyabinsk meteor strike, which injured at least 1,200 people in the Ural Mountains in Russia in 2013, was something of a wake up call. It's estimated that the rock weighed about 10 tons and was about 65 feet across when it broke up in the sky above the city of Chelyabinsk. That no one died is largely a product of the remote location and incredible luck.An analysis of the meteor published later that year suggested that dangerous strikes could be more common than many of us realized.The timing of the mission is important, AIM supporters say, because the Didymos pair's orbit won't bring it this close to Earth's again for another 100 years.“It is a very unique opportunity,” Cornelius Schalinski, deputy head of business development for OHB, a German private space company helping to implement AIM, told Space.com. “It has to go in 2020. Otherwise, the opportunity is lost. It is an asteroid that gets pretty close to Earth, so we can, with comparatively small cost and effort, test technologies that we need for future missions that are farther away.”At 250 million euros (about $265 million), AIM is considered a low-cost mission. But it faces some technical challenges. For one thing, scientists barely know anything about Didymoon's shape or composition, because its small size makes it difficult to image. The (relatively) tiny rock also has barely any gravity — according to Space.com, if you jumped on it you wouldn't come back down, but instead float off into space — making it hard to ensure a lander stays put on its surface.But ESA's recent Rosetta mission, which ended earlier this year, demonstrated that the space agency could plop a lander down on a very small body. Granted, the comet visited by Rosetta was about two miles across, not 550 feet. But the authors of the open letter say Rosetta was a big step toward what AIM hopes to achieve.Beyond demonstrating the potential for deflection, the joint ESA-NASA mission will also help scientists better understand asteroids — ancient chunks of material left over from the earliest days of the solar system.“We want to make sure that the heritage of Rosetta, in terms of technology and expertise, continues — leading to new missions and further innovation,” the letter said. “As citizens of our solar system, we need to expand our body of knowledge of the universe in which we live.”Read more:At the ‘Crater of Doom,’ geologists dig up rocks from the day the dinosaurs diedAncient Swedish space rock may be a whole new kind of meteoriteAsteroids splashed into the young moon — and they may be the source of its waterThis strange, tailless comet could teach us about Earth’s originsThis asteroid almost certainly isn't going to crash into Earth and kill us all                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",
       "3586  Imagine if scientists found out that a massive asteroid was on a collision course with Earth and would strike somewhere near Los Angeles by September 2020. What could humanity do?Not much. At least, that was the result of a day-long tabletop exercise coordinated by NASA and FEMA late last month. In their hypothetical scenario, the space agency concluded that the 330-foot space rock was approaching too quickly to mount a deflection mission. The team from FEMA was left to figure out how to evacuate millions of people from Southern California.This was a purely fictional exercise. NASA has discovered some 17,000 potentially hazardous near-Earth objects, but none of them is projected to come close to Earth in the next hundred years. No human that we know of has been killed by a meteorite or the effects of an impact, and the likelihood that this could happen to any of us is very, very slim. The chance of an impact big enough to destroy our planet is even smaller. Remember that Earth has suffered only one mass extinction-inducing impact that we know of in its 4.6 billion-year history, and even that asteroid didn't end life entirely. Our planet is pretty resilient.Still, plenty of researchers don't want to simply wait around and see what happens. This week, more than 100 planetary scientists, physicists and engineers published an open letter in support of a joint European Space Agency (ESA) and NASA mission to survey a near-Earth asteroid and attempt to deflect it.“Unlike other natural disasters, this is one we know how to predict and potentially prevent with early discovery,” the letter reads. “As such, it is crucial to our knowledge and understanding of asteroids to determine whether a kinetic impactor is able to deflect the orbit of such a small body, in case Earth is threatened. This is what AIDA [an Asteroid Impact and Deflection Assessment mission] will help us assess.”In early December, ESA's council of ministers will meet to decide on funding for the first half of the AIDA mission.ESA's half of the joint project with NASA is called the Asteroid Impact Mission (AIM). It would launch a spacecraft in 2020 to the Didymos asteroid and its “moonlet,” known as Didymoon. The pair of space rocks is expected to pass within 10 million miles of Earth around 2022.

       "3651  This story has been updated.Scientists at the European Space Agency downplayed the likely loss of its Mars lander, saying Thursday that a wealth of data sent back by the experimental probe would help them prepare for a future mission to the Red Planet.The Schiaparelli lander was designed mainly to test technology for a European robotic mission to Mars in 2020 and avoid the fate of Europe’s Beagle 2 probe, which failed to deploy after landing in 2003.Data received from Schiaparelli show that it entered the atmosphere as planned Wednesday and used its parachute to successfully slow down in the harsh Martian atmosphere, but its signal was lost shortly before the expected touchdown.Experts said the probe may have descended too fast or too slowly and hoped that about 600 megabytes of data sent back to Earth would provide answers. The data are equivalent to about 400,000 pages of information for scientists to sift through.“The experimental test has yielded a huge amount of data and clearly we’re going to have to analyze this in the days and weeks to come, but it gives us a lot of confidence for the future,” said David Parker, ESA’s director of human spaceflight and robotic exploration.“We need to understand what happened in the last few seconds before the planned landing and that is likely to take some time,” he said.Getting a spacecraft onto the surface of Mars is notoriously difficult, and the planet is littered with the remains of failed attempts. Only NASA has repeatedly succeeded in landing several robotic vehicles on the planet, including the Opportunity and Curiosity rovers.The apparent failure to achieve what rocket scientists call a “soft landing” marred an otherwise successful start to the ExoMars mission, a joint venture between ESA and Russian space agency Roscosmos.ESA chief Jan Woerner noted that Schiaparelli’s mother ship was put into orbit around Mars as planned. The Trace Gas Orbiter will analyze the atmosphere to help determine whether there is life on Mars.ESA’s member states are expected to decide in the coming months whether to pay the estimated $330 million needed for the second part of the ExoMars mission in 2020.Scientists haven’t given up all hope that Schiaparelli might yet phone home. Don McCoy, the manager of the ExoMars project, said attempts will be made to reset the probe’s transceiver but noted that its batteries are only expected to last for a few days.Parker said his team was undaunted by the fate of Schiaparelli.“Mars exploration is hard, and that’s one of the reasons we do it,” he said.

       "3687  Imagine if scientists found out that a massive asteroid was on a collision course with Earth and would strike somewhere near Los Angeles by September 2020. What could humanity do?Not much. At least, that was the result of a day-long tabletop exercise coordinated by NASA and FEMA late last month. In their hypothetical scenario, the space agency concluded that the 330-foot space rock was approaching too quickly to mount a deflection mission. The team from FEMA was left to figure out how to evacuate millions of people from Southern California.This was a purely fictional exercise. NASA has discovered some 17,000 potentially hazardous near-Earth objects, but none of them is projected to come close to Earth in the next hundred years. No human that we know of has been killed by a meteorite or the effects of an impact, and the likelihood that this could happen to any of us is very, very slim. The chance of an impact big enough to destroy our planet is even smaller. Remember that Earth has suffered only one mass extinction-inducing impact that we know of in its 4.6 billion-year history, and even that asteroid didn't end life entirely. Our planet is pretty resilient.Still, plenty of researchers don't want to simply wait around and see what happens. This week, more than 100 planetary scientists, physicists and engineers published an open letter in support of a joint European Space Agency (ESA) and NASA mission to survey a near-Earth asteroid and attempt to deflect it.“Unlike other natural disasters, this is one we know how to predict and potentially prevent with early discovery,” the letter reads. “As such, it is crucial to our knowledge and understanding of asteroids to determine whether a kinetic impactor is able to deflect the orbit of such a small body, in case Earth is threatened. This is what AIDA [an Asteroid Impact and Deflection Assessment mission] will help us assess.”In early December, ESA's council of ministers will meet to decide on funding for the first half of the AIDA mission.ESA's half of the joint project with NASA is called the Asteroid Impact Mission (AIM). It would launch a spacecraft in 2020 to the Didymos asteroid and its “moonlet,” known as Didymoon. The pair of space rocks is expected to pass within 10 million miles of Earth around 2022. From an interplanetary perspective, that's a hair's breadth.The smaller of the two bodies — 550-foot wide Didymoon — is AIM's target. The spacecraft would release a probe to land on the rock's surface, as well as two satellites to orbit around it.Four months later, a NASA spacecraft would complete the second part of the mission with a Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART). With the ESA satellites watching, the DART spacecraft is scheduled to slam into Didymoon and attempt to knock it off course.Aside from demonstrating NASA's over-the-top love for acronyms, the two-part mission would provide proof-of-concept for the idea that a “kinetic impactor” can change the trajectory of a rock in space — that is, if it works. In the remote possibility that it becomes necessary, NASA might one day use this technique to shift an asteroid away from Earth's orbit.“New NEOs [near-Earth objects] are now being discovered at the rate of some four per day,” Alan Harris, a letter signatory and senior scientist at German Aerospace Center, noted at a news conference. “We need a coordinated international strategy for near-Earth object impact mitigation.”Many asteroid researchers say that the Chelyabinsk meteor strike, which injured at least 1,200 people in the Ural Mountains in Russia in 2013, was something of a wake up call. It's estimated that the rock weighed about 10 tons and was about 65 feet across when it broke up in the sky above the city of Chelyabinsk. That no one died is largely a product of the remote location and incredible luck.An analysis of the meteor published later that year suggested that dangerous strikes could be more common than many of us realized.The timing of the mission is important, AIM supporters say, because the Didymos pair's orbit won't bring it this close to Earth's again for another 100 years.“It is a very unique opportunity,” Cornelius Schalinski, deputy head of business development for OHB, a German private space company helping to implement AIM, told Space.com. “It has to go in 2020. Otherwise, the opportunity is lost. It is an asteroid that gets pretty close to Earth, so we can, with comparatively small cost and effort, test technologies that we need for future missions that are farther away.”At 250 million euros (about $265 million), AIM is considered a low-cost mission. But it faces some technical challenges. For one thing, scientists barely know anything about Didymoon's shape or composition, because its small size makes it difficult to image. The (relatively) tiny rock also has barely any gravity — according to Space.com, if you jumped on it you wouldn't come back down, but instead float off into space — making it hard to ensure a lander stays put on its surface.But ESA's recent Rosetta mission, which ended earlier this year, demonstrated that the space agency could plop a lander down on a very small body. Granted, the comet visited by Rosetta was about two miles across, not 550 feet. But the authors of the open letter say Rosetta was a big step toward what AIM hopes to achieve.Beyond demonstrating the potential for deflection, the joint ESA-NASA mission will also help scientists better understand asteroids — ancient chunks of material left over from the earliest days of the solar system.“We want to make sure that the heritage of Rosetta, in terms of technology and expertise, continues — leading to new missions and further innovation,” the letter said. “As citizens of our solar system, we need to expand our body of knowledge of the universe in which we live.”Read more:At the ‘Crater of Doom,’ geologists dig up rocks from the day the dinosaurs diedAncient Swedish space rock may be a whole new kind of meteoriteAsteroids splashed into the young moon — and they may be the source of its waterThis strange, tailless comet could teach us about Earth’s originsThis asteroid almost certainly isn't going to crash into Earth and kill us all                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",
       "3809  This post has been updated. The ExoMars Schiaparelli lander — a European and Russian robot that was slated to touch down on Mars on Wednesday — probably crashed during landing, early telemetry data suggests.According to the European Space Agency, radio signals from the spacecraft that were picked up by an Earth telescope and a Mars orbiter suggest that Schiaparelli performed most of its six-minute descent maneuver according to plan. But sometime after deploying its parachute and heat shield, just before touching down, the lander stopped communicating. It hasn't been heard from since.The ESA hasn't conceded that the spacecraft did not achieve its planned “soft landing,” but the outlook is not good.The lander would have been the first operable spacecraft from either the European Space Agency or the Russian Federal Space Agency to successfully land on Mars. It is part of the ExoMars astrobiology mission, which also put a satellite into orbit around the Red Planet on Wednesday.Telemetry data beamed to Earth from Schiaparelli's sister spacecraft, the Trace Gas Orbiter, suggests that the lander may have jettisoned its heat shield too soon. It also seems that Schiaparelli's thrusters, which were supposed to slow its descent, were turned off earlier than expected.The ESA may try to call out to the probe in hopes that it is intact and capable of responding. But Jonathan Amos, a journalist from the BBC who was at ESA Mission Control in Darmstadt, Germany, reported that the mood there is grim.“Many scientists here at mission control have taken all this information to mean one thing,” he wrote, “that the probe crashed at high speed. It is likely it went into freefall a kilometer or two above the surface.”The news comes after a long day and anxious night of waitingThe Schiaparelli lander was able to muster a hazy transmission during its descent, letting engineers know that its parachutes had deployed. But then, nothing. For several tense hours, telescopes around the globe were trained toward Mars, each listening for a faint signal from the newest arrival on the planet. Just before noon Eastern, ESA's Mars Express orbiter began transmitting a packet of data from the lander back to scientists on Earth; that recording was inconclusive. A few hours after that, NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter passed over the spot where Schiaparelli was to have landed and did not pick up a signal.“The tension mounts: Has Schiaparelli fallen victim to the Great Galactic Ghoul, Mars-probe predator since the 1960s?” astronomer Jonathan McDowell wondered on Twitter on Wednesday. The ghoul — which supposedly roams the darkness between Earth and its neighbor, snapping up hapless spacecraft attempting to reach Mars — is a joke invented in 1964 to explain why so many Mars missions fail.The uncertainty overshadowed the successful orbital insertion of the Trace Gas Orbiter (TGO). The maneuver was conducted on the far side of the planet, out of reach of Earth-based telescopes. But just before 1 p.m., the TGO pulled out of Mars's shadow and sent its first transmission home. Initial checks on the spacecraft's health looked positive, and about 3 p.m., ESA confirmed that everything had gone according to plan.Currently, there are five orbiters (NASA's Mars Odyssey, Mars Reconnaissance and MAVEN orbiters, ESA's Mars Express and the Indian Space Research Organization's Mars Orbiter Mission) and two rovers (NASA's Opportunity and Curiosity) operating on the Red Planet.There are also carcasses of dozens of expired and unsuccessful missions littering the terrain. Among them is the Beagle 2 lander, which the ESA landed on the planet in 2003 but never heard from again. More than a decade later, images from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter confirmed that the Beagle 2 had failed to deploy its solar panels and antenna.That breakdown underscores how rare successful landings are. More than 50 percent of all missions to Mars have resulted in lost spacecraft, crash landing, failed batteries and a host of other disasters.The ESA and RFSA hope that understanding which of these problems befell Schiaparelli might help them achieve their first successful Mars landing when they launch a rover in a few years.“Schiaparelli’s primary role was to test European landing technologies,” Jan Wörner, ESA’s director general, said in a statement. “Recording the data during the descent was part of that, and it is important we can learn what happened, in order to prepare for the future.”The primary scientific instruments for the mission are all on board the TGO, which will spend the next several years scanning the Martian skies for methane and other vital gases that could be signatures of life. (You can read more about ExoMars's scientific goals here.)But the lander's failure may bode poorly for the planned second phase of the ExoMars mission: The rover that is slated to launch in 2020. That project already has been postponed by two years (it was originally scheduled for 2018) and still needs to secure at least a couple hundred million Euros in additional funding. The likely failure of the Schiaparelli landing won't make it any easier to win support and financial backing for the beleaguered 1.2 billion Euro mission.But speaking to the media Thursday morning, officials at ESA were determined to keep it upbeat. The TGO's orbital insertion was picture-perfect, and the crash landing can be, well, a learning opportunity.“Following yesterday’s events we have an impressive orbiter around Mars ready for science and for relay support for the ExoMars rover mission in 2020,” Wörner said in a statement.Read more:Dear Science: How did the planets get their names?The universe may have 10 times as many galaxies as we thoughtA comet smashing into ancient Earth may have set off catastrophic global warmingElon Musk unveils Mars colonization plan, but don't pack your bags just yet                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
       "4375  Imagine if scientists found out that a massive asteroid was on a collision course with Earth and would strike somewhere near Los Angeles by September 2020. What could humanity do?Not much. At least, that was the result of a day-long tabletop exercise coordinated by NASA and FEMA late last month. In their hypothetical scenario, the space agency concluded that the 330-foot space rock was approaching too quickly to mount a deflection mission. The team from FEMA was left to figure out how to evacuate millions of people from Southern California.This was a purely fictional exercise. NASA has discovered some 17,000 potentially hazardous near-Earth objects, but none of them is projected to come close to Earth in the next hundred years. No human that we know of has been killed by a meteorite or the effects of an impact, and the likelihood that this could happen to any of us is very, very slim. The chance of an impact big enough to destroy our planet is even smaller. Remember that Earth has suffered only one mass extinction-inducing impact that we know of in its 4.6 billion-year history, and even that asteroid didn't end life entirely. Our planet is pretty resilient.Still, plenty of researchers don't want to simply wait around and see what happens. This week, more than 100 planetary scientists, physicists and engineers published an open letter in support of a joint European Space Agency (ESA) and NASA mission to survey a near-Earth asteroid and attempt to deflect it.“Unlike other natural disasters, this is one we know how to predict and potentially prevent with early discovery,” the letter reads. “As such, it is crucial to our knowledge and understanding of asteroids to determine whether a kinetic impactor is able to deflect the orbit of such a small body, in case Earth is threatened. This is what AIDA [an Asteroid Impact and Deflection Assessment mission] will help us assess.”In early December, ESA's council of ministers will meet to decide on funding for the first half of the AIDA mission.ESA's half of the joint project with NASA is called the Asteroid Impact Mission (AIM). It would launch a spacecraft in 2020 to the Didymos asteroid and its “moonlet,” known as Didymoon. The pair of space rocks is expected to pass within 10 million miles of Earth around 2022. From an interplanetary perspective, that's a hair's breadth.The smaller of the two bodies — 550-foot wide Didymoon — is AIM's target. The spacecraft would release a probe to land on the rock's surface, as well as two satellites to orbit around it.Four months later, a NASA spacecraft would complete the second part of the mission with a Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART). With the ESA satellites watching, the DART spacecraft is scheduled to slam into Didymoon and attempt to knock it off course.Aside from demonstrating NASA's over-the-top love for acronyms, the two-part mission would provide proof-of-concept for the idea that a “kinetic impactor” can change the trajectory of a rock in space — that is, if it works. In the remote possibility that it becomes necessary, NASA might one day use this technique to shift an asteroid away from Earth's orbit.“New NEOs [near-Earth objects] are now being discovered at the rate of some four per day,” Alan Harris, a letter signatory and senior scientist at German Aerospace Center, noted at a news conference. “We need a coordinated international strategy for near-Earth object impact mitigation.”Many asteroid researchers say that the Chelyabinsk meteor strike, which injured at least 1,200 people in the Ural Mountains in Russia in 2013, was something of a wake up call. It's estimated that the rock weighed about 10 tons and was about 65 feet across when it broke up in the sky above the city of Chelyabinsk. That no one died is largely a product of the remote location and incredible luck.An analysis of the meteor published later that year suggested that dangerous strikes could be more common than many of us realized.The timing of the mission is important, AIM supporters say, because the Didymos pair's orbit won't bring it this close to Earth's again for another 100 years.“It is a very unique opportunity,” Cornelius Schalinski, deputy head of business development for OHB, a German private space company helping to implement AIM, told Space.com. “It has to go in 2020. Otherwise, the opportunity is lost. It is an asteroid that gets pretty close to Earth, so we can, with comparatively small cost and effort, test technologies that we need for future missions that are farther away.”At 250 million euros (about $265 million), AIM is considered a low-cost mission. But it faces some technical challenges. For one thing, scientists barely know anything about Didymoon's shape or composition, because its small size makes it difficult to image. The (relatively) tiny rock also has barely any gravity — according to Space.com, if you jumped on it you wouldn't come back down, but instead float off into space — making it hard to ensure a lander stays put on its surface.But ESA's recent Rosetta mission, which ended earlier this year, demonstrated that the space agency could plop a lander down on a very small body. Granted, the comet visited by Rosetta was about two miles across, not 550 feet. But the authors of the open letter say Rosetta was a big step toward what AIM hopes to achieve.Beyond demonstrating the potential for deflection, the joint ESA-NASA mission will also help scientists better understand asteroids — ancient chunks of material left over from the earliest days of the solar system.“We want to make sure that the heritage of Rosetta, in terms of technology and expertise, continues — leading to new missions and further innovation,” the letter said. “As citizens of our solar system, we need to expand our body of knowledge of the universe in which we live.”Read more:At the ‘Crater of Doom,’ geologists dig up rocks from the day the dinosaurs diedAncient Swedish space rock may be a whole new kind of meteoriteAsteroids splashed into the young moon — and they may be the source of its waterThis strange, tailless comet could teach us about Earth’s originsThis asteroid almost certainly isn't going to crash into Earth and kill us all                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",
       "4634  The day Gil Levin says he detected life on Mars, he was waiting in his lab at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, watching a piece of paper inch out of a printer.Levin snatched the sheet and scrutinized the freshly inked graph. A thin line measuring radioactive carbon crept steadily upward, just as it always did when Levin performed the test with microbes on Earth. But this data came from tens of millions of miles away, where NASA's Viking lander was — for the first time in history — conducting an experiment on the surface of Mars.\"Gil, that's life,\" his co-investigator, Patricia Straat, exclaimed when she saw the first results come in. There was jubilation at JPL. Afterward, Levin said, he drove into the mountains above Los Angeles, sat on the ground and stared up at the night sky.\"I was sort of trembling, you know?\" he recalled. It was July 30, 1976.Forty years later, Levin and Straat still believe that their experiment was evidence of microbiotic Martians. But few people agree with them. To NASA, and to most scientists, the 1976 Viking mission was a technical triumph but a biological bust. Scientists, such as Carl Sagan, who had wagered that large organisms \"are not only possible on Mars; they may be favored,\" were disappointed to see images the lander sent back of a dry, barren planet. Two experiments aimed at finding life turned up negative, and NASA concluded that the results of Levin's test, called the Labeled Release experiment, could be explained by chemical processes rather than biological ones.“I was sort of set aback,” recalled NASA chief astrobiologist Penny Boston, who was still in college at the time. “I was thinking, ‘Gosh, I want to work in exobiology, as we called it at the time, and now it seems like it’s just a pile of rocks, and there’s no life there at all.'”Viking put a 20-year damper on Mars exploration. Even when NASA did return to the Red Planet, it completely quit trying to test for living organisms directly.But hope was in the air at Langley Research Center last week, where NASA held a two-day conference to honor the 40th anniversary of the Viking landing. After decades of pointedly not looking for it, the space agency is more optimistic than it's been since 1976 that it might find life on Mars yet.\"Every new piece of information we get about the planet seems to point to greater and greater habitability,\" Boston said. \"It just seems more and more likely.\"The issue with the Viking experiments is that they expected to find too much too soon, speaker after speaker explained over the course of the conference. Detecting life with Viking would have been a breakthrough of unprecedented proportions, and science doesn't usually happen that way. Most \"breakthroughs\" come after years of accumulating incremental increases in knowledge.So, for the past four decades, \"we’ve engaged in creeping up on the problem,\" Boston said. Some evidence in favor of a livable Mars came from the same mission that seemed to quash the possibility: Viking itself. While the two landers relayed bleak photos and disappointing data from the surface, the orbiters that were launched along with them revealed landscapes that looked strikingly like ones on our own planet.Ellen Stofan, now NASA's chief scientist, was then a summer intern at JPL assigned to map Mangala Valles, a system of crisscrossing channels near Mars's equator.\"What was so fascinating were all these features that were so familiar from our studies of the Earth,\" she recalled. \"Things like teardrop-shaped islands, abandoned oxbow sections of channels, features that by looking at rivers on Earth we could understand that these features on Mars had been carved by water, and in some cases by great floods of water, coursing across the Martian surface.\"Images from the Viking orbiters confirmed what the Mariner 9 satellite found when it arrived at the planet five years earlier: Mars once had water, a key ingredient for the evolution of life as we know it. But that water existed hundreds of millions, perhaps even billions, of years ago, offering little promise that organisms might still exist.Today, the space agency has two rovers and three active satellites surveying the planet. Among them is the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) a bulky spacecraft shaped like a metal water bird that flew into Mars orbit in 2006.In the fall, NASA announced that photos from MRO showing dark, tendril-like formations called recurring slope lineae were actually evidence of liquid water on the planet's surface. It's only a tiny amount, and only appears under specific circumstances, but \"it's really important from a scientific point of view,\" Stofan said last week. \"... If there's life on Mars, that's probably the environment in which we would find it.\"Other spacecraft have uncovered organic compounds in Martian soil and fluctuating levels of methane, which is usually a biological byproduct, in the atmosphere. Mars may be a frigid, atmosphere-less, radiation-bombarded desert, but it is slightly less of an inhospitable wasteland than the version Viking first captured 40 years ago.Meanwhile, here on Earth, scientists have begun to realize that even apparent \"wastelands\" aren't as inhospitable as they seem.When Viking landed in 1976, our understanding of the capacities and diversity of microscopic life was fairly limited. Most microbiological knowledge came from medicine, in which scientists focused on the bacteria that lived in our bodies or infected them.\"It’s almost like we were looking for a gut bacteria on Mars,\" Boston said. \"We were naive, really, about the capabilities of microbes and what you need to do to find them.\" But a year after the Viking experiments, divers discovered bizarre creatures living in the dark, toxic waters around hydrothermal vents at the bottom of the Pacific — the first organisms capable of making a living off chemicals, rather than sunlight. Scientists have also found microrganisms deep within the oceanic crust and high up in the stratosphere.Boston herself, who spent 30 years studying life in caves before being appointed director of NASA's Astrobiology Institute this year, has discovered microbes that can metabolize minerals in dark cracks in the earth. Similar environments — lava tubes, the bottoms of lake beds, rock overhangs, tiny cavities in the soil — exist on Mars and would offer protection from the planet's frigid climate and punishing solar radiation.\"That's where I want to go look,\" she said.This kind of talk is frustrating for Levin, who has held for 30 years that life on Mars has already been detected. At the anniversary event Wednesday, he exhorted the audience, \"there is no scientifically acceptable explanation to the Labeled Release experiments on Mars, except life.\"Off stage, Levin admitted he was surprised he was invited to speak at the conference (when he announced his opinion at the 10th anniversary celebration, he says he was pelted with shrimp).“I’m very glad because I was invited, despite this long convolution of disagreements. I kind of hope it means they’re beginning to consider the experiment again,\" he said. In a statement, Walt Engelund, the director of the Space Technology and Exploration Directorate at NASA Langley, said there was no \"implicit motivation\" in inviting Levin. He was an integral part of the mission's science team, and merited a chance to \"discuss and defend his own perspectives,\" Engelund said.But it is true that NASA is gearing up to start a more focused search for Martians past and present. The last decade and a half of Mars exploration has focused on \"following the water\" to identify spots where the Red Planet might potentially be habitable.\"It's a much more sophisticated approach,\" Boston said. \"We’re trying to map out the parameters that we know are conducive to life surviving — and it’s a whole lot more work than we realized.\" (Levin, ever impatient, scoffed at that excuse.)A new rover scheduled to launch in 2020 will carry several instruments aimed   \n",

Our planet is pretty resilient.Still, plenty of researchers don't want to simply wait around and see what happens. This week, more than 100 planetary scientists, physicists and engineers published an open letter in support of a joint European Space Agency (ESA) and NASA mission to survey a near-Earth asteroid and attempt to deflect it.“Unlike other natural disasters, this is one we know how to predict and potentially prevent with early discovery,” the letter reads. “As such, it is crucial to our knowledge and understanding of asteroids to determine whether a kinetic impactor is able to deflect the orbit of such a small body, in case Earth is threatened. This is what AIDA [an Asteroid Impact and Deflection Assessment mission] will help us assess.”In early December, ESA's council of ministers will meet to decide on funding for the first half of the AIDA mission.ESA's half of the joint project with NASA is called the Asteroid Impact Mission (AIM). It would launch a spacecraft in 2020 to the Didymos asteroid and its “moonlet,” known as Didymoon. The pair of space rocks is expected to pass within 10 million miles of Earth around 2022. From an interplanetary perspective, that's a hair's breadth.The smaller of the two bodies — 550-foot wide Didymoon — is AIM's target. The spacecraft would release a probe to land on the rock's surface, as well as two satellites to orbit around it.Four months later, a NASA spacecraft would complete the second part of the mission with a Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART). With the ESA satellites watching, the DART spacecraft is scheduled to slam into Didymoon and attempt to knock it off course.Aside from demonstrating NASA's over-the-top love for acronyms, the two-part mission would provide proof-of-concept for the idea that a “kinetic impactor” can change the trajectory of a rock in space — that is, if it works. In the remote possibility that it becomes necessary, NASA might one day use this technique to shift an asteroid away from Earth's orbit.“New NEOs [near-Earth objects] are now being discovered at the rate of some four per day,” Alan Harris, a letter signatory and senior scientist at German Aerospace Center, noted at a news conference. “We need a coordinated international strategy for near-Earth object impact mitigation.”Many asteroid researchers say that the Chelyabinsk meteor strike, which injured at least 1,200 people in the Ural Mountains in Russia in 2013, was something of a wake up call. It's estimated that the rock weighed about 10 tons and was about 65 feet across when it broke up in the sky above the city of Chelyabinsk. That no one died is largely a product of the remote location and incredible luck.An analysis of the meteor published later that year suggested that dangerous strikes could be more common than many of us realized.The timing of the mission is important, AIM supporters say, because the Didymos pair's orbit won't bring it this close to Earth's again for another 100 years.“It is a very unique opportunity,” Cornelius Schalinski, deputy head of business development for OHB, a German private space company helping to implement AIM, told Space.com. “It has to go in 2020. Otherwise, the opportunity is lost. It is an asteroid that gets pretty close to Earth, so we can, with comparatively small cost and effort, test technologies that we need for future missions that are farther away.”At 250 million euros (about $265 million), AIM is considered a low-cost mission. But it faces some technical challenges. For one thing, scientists barely know anything about Didymoon's shape or composition, because its small size makes it difficult to image. The (relatively) tiny rock also has barely any gravity — according to Space.com, if you jumped on it you wouldn't come back down, but instead float off into space — making it hard to ensure a lander stays put on its surface.But ESA's recent Rosetta mission, which ended earlier this year, demonstrated that the space agency could plop a lander down on a very small body. Granted, the comet visited by Rosetta was about two miles across, not 550 feet. But the authors of the open letter say Rosetta was a big step toward what AIM hopes to achieve.Beyond demonstrating the potential for deflection, the joint ESA-NASA mission will also help scientists better understand asteroids — ancient chunks of material left over from the earliest days of the solar system.“We want to make sure that the heritage of Rosetta, in terms of technology and expertise, continues — leading to new missions and further innovation,” the letter said. “As citizens of our solar system, we need to expand our body of knowledge of the universe in which we live.”Read more:At the ‘Crater of Doom,’ geologists dig up rocks from the day the dinosaurs diedAncient Swedish space rock may be a whole new kind of meteoriteAsteroids splashed into the young moon — and they may be the source of its waterThis strange, tailless comet could teach us about Earth’s originsThis asteroid almost certainly isn't going to crash into Earth and kill us all                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",
       "6091  It was a day when the Earth was caught in a cosmic crossfire. The big rock came from the south, the smaller one from the east. They were unrelated objects, with different orbits, one the size of an apartment building, the other slimmer but with better aim.The larger asteroid missed by 17,000 miles, as expected, but the Russian meteor stole the show Friday, fireballing across the Ural Mountains in spectacular fashion and exploding into fragments, creating a powerful shock wave that blew out windows, collapsed roofs and injured 1,200 people, mostly from broken glass. It was surely the most thoroughly documented meteor in human history — captured by countless crack-of-dawn Russian drivers who own dashboard cameras.The spectacle capped an extraordinary day for the planet. The object, which exploded over the industrial city of Chelyabinsk, caused the largest such impact in more than a century and was the first to inflict significant human casualties, with at least 48 victims hospitalized.The asteroid that was supposed to show up Friday, the much-hyped 2012 DA14, passed by harmlessly, just as the experts had promised it would.But they had no way of seeing the other rock heading toward Russia. The explanation from NASA scientists, when asked why they hadn’t spotted it, boiled down to two simple facts: It was small, and the sun was in their eyes.“This was the largest object observed to hit the Earth since 1908,” said Margaret Campbell-Brown, an astronomer at the University of Western Ontario. That’s when another space rock exploded over Siberia, leveling 800 square miles of forest in what became known as the Tunguska event.On Friday, a global network of sensors recorded the space rock’s object’s descent and revealed its stunning power. It measured about 50 feet wide, weighed more than a nuclear-powered submarine and screamed in at 40,000 miles per hour, said Campbell-Brown, who examined data from sonic sensors deployed by the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization to detect nuclear detonations.In its 30-second shallow-angle dive into the thickening atmosphere, the meteor shed energy equivalent to more than 20 Hiroshima-size atomic bombs. Most of that energy was dissipated many miles above the surface, and, in a sense, the atmosphere saved the day, preventing catastrophic damage from a major surface impact.Initial estimates from Russian authorities sketched a much smaller and weaker object, but scientists say the nuclear-sensor network provides the best measure an incoming asteroid’s size and power.Intense heat and pressure shattered the object into dozens of large pieces during its descent. Russian officials said they believed they had identified meteorite fragments on the ground 50 miles west of Chelyabinsk and had reports of pieces stretched out over another 75 miles.Searchers also found a circular hole in the ice, 15 to 20 feet across, in a lake west of Chelyabinsk, and roped it off.A transcript from a meeting of Russian emergency officials indicated about 3,000 buildings suffered damage.The region’s governor, Mikhail Yurevich, said the biggest worry after the incident was the cold, with single-digit temperatures forecast overnight. “Our main task now is to preserve the heat in offices and homes where windows were shattered, to prevent the heating system from freezing,” he said.Chelyabinsk, a city of 1.1 million people, has a high concentration of defense industries, and arsenals in its vicinity have occasionally exploded, but the meteor’s arrival appears not to have set off any. The roof of a zinc factory, however, came crashing down, triggering a spike in global zinc prices.Russian President Vladimir Putin said, “Thank God no large objects fell in populated areas. However, there were still people who were injured.” The Interior Ministry, meanwhile, mobilized 10,000 police to deal with the incident.The event immediately generated conspiracy theories. One anti-Western member of Russia’s parliament, Vladimir Zhirinovsky, claimed that the meteor was actually a U.S. weapons test.Scientists say the object was instead a small asteroid. NASA’s Bill Cooke said it flew in from the asteroid belt, a band of space rocks circling the sun beyond Mars and the source of all near-Earth asteroids.History has recorded occasional injuries from meteorites, but the number hurt Friday is unprecedented, said Timothy McCoy, who studies meteorites at the Smithsonian’s National Museum of Natural History. “I can’t think of a burst this size over a city before,” he said.Amateur footage showed at least two orange flashes as the meteor streaked over apartment buildings. A series of booms trailed the space rock. As it exploded, the meteor briefly blazed brighter than the sun.And no one saw it coming.A weather satellite’s camera snapped the meteor’s dive, but a global network of asteroid-spotting telescopes funded by NASA failed to detect it. The sun was in the way, the telescopes blinded by a dayside approach.“An asteroid such as this is virtually impossible to see ahead of time,” said Paul Chodas of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif.The twin asteroid encounters on Friday — one benign, the other malign — laid bare both the uncertain reality of life in the cosmos — you never know when a space rock might come crashing down — and our planet’s lack of defense against such threats.NASA, the world’s lead agency for detecting asteroid hazards, boosted its budget for the task from $6 million in 2011 to $21 million last year. And a NASA effort launched in 1998 has found 95 percent of potential “planet killers” at least a mile wide; none is headed for Earth. But still, many say the agency, and the world, are not doing enough.Two congressmen seized the moment to promise hearings on the planet’s space-threat readiness. Lamar Smith (R-Tex.), chairman of the House Science, Space and Technology Committee, said in a statement that developing technology to track asteroids “is critical to our future,” while Dana Rohrabacher (R-Calif.) called asteroid impacts the “only true preventable natural disaster.” Even if we find one that will hit us, he said, “we might not be able to deflect it.”A private effort by two former astronauts to build a space telescope to spot smaller Earth-bound asteroids has raised a few million dollars, but is years away from launch — if it ever gets off the ground.Plans to deflect asteroids are even more nascent. Proposals range from the sublime — spraying an asteroid with reflective paint so the sun nudges it — to the extreme — nuking it. With early detection and a few decades of lead time, even a tiny nudge could push an asteroid out of the tiny “keyhole” in space that would otherwise send it crashing to Earth.The European Space Agency and NASA are in the early stages of plotting a mission to smash a spacecraft into an asteroid to see if humans can, in fact, push around a sizeable space rock. The project, called AIM-DART, has no timeline and no real budget.In another cosmic coincidence, three of the nation’s top asteroid trackers met in Vienna on Friday with international counterparts under the auspices of the United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space to better coordinate planetary defense.“This is a what-sort-of-things-are-we-doing-to-protect-the-Earth meeting,” said Timothy Spahr, director of the Minor Planet Center at Harvard University, the international clearinghouse for asteroid tracking. He said enthusiasm for building a better detection network runs high among the attendees from dozens of nations.As for meeting on the day when the reality of extraterrestrial threats burst into view over Russia, Spahr said, “Yeah, pretty crazy timing.”Englund reported from Moscow.

       "6134  This post has been updated. The ExoMars Schiaparelli lander — a European and Russian robot that was slated to touch down on Mars on Wednesday — probably crashed during landing, early telemetry data suggests.According to the European Space Agency, radio signals from the spacecraft that were picked up by an Earth telescope and a Mars orbiter suggest that Schiaparelli performed most of its six-minute descent maneuver according to plan. But sometime after deploying its parachute and heat shield, just before touching down, the lander stopped communicating. It hasn't been heard from since.The ESA hasn't conceded that the spacecraft did not achieve its planned “soft landing,” but the outlook is not good.The lander would have been the first operable spacecraft from either the European Space Agency or the Russian Federal Space Agency to successfully land on Mars. It is part of the ExoMars astrobiology mission, which also put a satellite into orbit around the Red Planet on Wednesday.Telemetry data beamed to Earth from Schiaparelli's sister spacecraft, the Trace Gas Orbiter, suggests that the lander may have jettisoned its heat shield too soon. It also seems that Schiaparelli's thrusters, which were supposed to slow its descent, were turned off earlier than expected.The ESA may try to call out to the probe in hopes that it is intact and capable of responding. But Jonathan Amos, a journalist from the BBC who was at ESA Mission Control in Darmstadt, Germany, reported that the mood there is grim.“Many scientists here at mission control have taken all this information to mean one thing,” he wrote, “that the probe crashed at high speed. It is likely it went into freefall a kilometer or two above the surface.”The news comes after a long day and anxious night of waitingThe Schiaparelli lander was able to muster a hazy transmission during its descent, letting engineers know that its parachutes had deployed. But then, nothing. For several tense hours, telescopes around the globe were trained toward Mars, each listening for a faint signal from the newest arrival on the planet. Just before noon Eastern, ESA's Mars Express orbiter began transmitting a packet of data from the lander back to scientists on Earth; that recording was inconclusive. A few hours after that, NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter passed over the spot where Schiaparelli was to have landed and did not pick up a signal.“The tension mounts: Has Schiaparelli fallen victim to the Great Galactic Ghoul, Mars-probe predator since the 1960s?” astronomer Jonathan McDowell wondered on Twitter on Wednesday. The ghoul — which supposedly roams the darkness between Earth and its neighbor, snapping up hapless spacecraft attempting to reach Mars — is a joke invented in 1964 to explain why so many Mars missions fail.The uncertainty overshadowed the successful orbital insertion of the Trace Gas Orbiter (TGO). The maneuver was conducted on the far side of the planet, out of reach of Earth-based telescopes. But just before 1 p.m., the TGO pulled out of Mars's shadow and sent its first transmission home. Initial checks on the spacecraft's health looked positive, and about 3 p.m., ESA confirmed that everything had gone according to plan.Currently, there are five orbiters (NASA's Mars Odyssey, Mars Reconnaissance and MAVEN orbiters, ESA's Mars Express and the Indian Space Research Organization's Mars Orbiter Mission) and two rovers (NASA's Opportunity and Curiosity) operating on the Red Planet.There are also carcasses of dozens of expired and unsuccessful missions littering the terrain. Among them is the Beagle 2 lander, which the ESA landed on the planet in 2003 but never heard from again. More than a decade later, images from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter confirmed that the Beagle 2 had failed to deploy its solar panels and antenna.That breakdown underscores how rare successful landings are. More than 50 percent of all missions to Mars have resulted in lost spacecraft, crash landing, failed batteries and a host of other disasters.The ESA and RFSA hope that understanding which of these problems befell Schiaparelli might help them achieve their first successful Mars landing when they launch a rover in a few years.“Schiaparelli’s primary role was to test European landing technologies,” Jan Wörner, ESA’s director general, said in a statement. “Recording the data during the descent was part of that, and it is important we can learn what happened, in order to prepare for the future.”The primary scientific instruments for the mission are all on board the TGO, which will spend the next several years scanning the Martian skies for methane and other vital gases that could be signatures of life. (You can read more about ExoMars's scientific goals here.)But the lander's failure may bode poorly for the planned second phase of the ExoMars mission: The rover that is slated to launch in 2020. That project already has been postponed by two years (it was originally scheduled for 2018) and still needs to secure at least a couple hundred million Euros in additional funding. The likely failure of the Schiaparelli landing won't make it any easier to win support and financial backing for the beleaguered 1.2 billion Euro mission.But speaking to the media Thursday morning, officials at ESA were determined to keep it upbeat. The TGO's orbital insertion was picture-perfect, and the crash landing can be, well, a learning opportunity.“Following yesterday’s events we have an impressive orbiter around Mars ready for science and for relay support for the ExoMars rover mission in 2020,” Wörner said in a statement.Read more:Dear Science: How did the planets get their names?The universe may have 10 times as many galaxies as we thoughtA comet smashing into ancient Earth may have set off catastrophic global warmingElon Musk unveils Mars colonization plan, but don't pack your bags just yet                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
       "6336  The ExoMars Schiaparelli lander, which was slated to touch down on Mars on Wednesday, crashed on the planet after its thrusters shut off prematurely, the European Space Agency confirmed Friday. And because Schiaparelli still had fuel left in its tank, the craft may have exploded on impact.The nine thrusters on the small spacecraft were supposed to slow its descent through the Martian atmosphere, which is so thin that objects move through it at perilously high speeds.Images taken by NASA’s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter show two new features on the surface of the planet that could be evidence of the crash. At the bottom of one close-up image, a bright white spot is thought to be the parachute used during Schiaparelli’s descent. Data suggests that parachute and the spacecraft’s heat shield were successfully deployed and discarded before the final phase of the landing. A dark patch, roughly 50-by-130 meters in area and little over half a mile north of the parachute, looks like material that was blown up when Schiaparelli hit the ground.The lander, part of the joint ExoMars astrobiology mission of the ESA and the Russian Federal Space Agency, would have been the first operable spacecraft from either agency to successfully touch down on the Martian surface.Schiaparelli hadn't been heard from since just before its planned landing, and by Thursday morning most scientists at ESA mission control feared the worst. The crash has overshadowed the successful orbital insertion of Schiaparelli's parent spacecraft, the Trace Gas Orbiter, which will circle the planet looking for methane for the next six years.Data from the orbiter is being analyzed to understand why the lander failed to achieve a soft landing. The ESA estimates that Schiaparelli began its free fall at a mile or two above the surface and was traveling more than 180 miles per hour when it hit the ground.The agency still doesn't know why the thrusters shut off prematurely.Determined to put a positive spin on things, ESA officials have repeatedly emphasized that Schiaparelli was designed as a test lander. It carried few scientific instruments and was only intended to last a few days on Mars. Its main objective was to test technologies such as the heat shield, parachute, radar and thrusters — which, one could argue it did, even though some of the technologies failed.“We got the data, we did the test, so I am very happy,” ESA director Jan Woerner said at a news conference Thursday.Even so, scientists and space enthusiasts are probably going to be pouring one out for Schiaparelli tonight.Read more:Dear Science: How did the planets get their names?The universe may have 10 times as many galaxies as we thoughtA comet smashing into ancient Earth may have set off catastrophic

And because Schiaparelli still had fuel left in its tank, the craft may have exploded on impact.The nine thrusters on the small spacecraft were supposed to slow its descent through the Martian atmosphere, which is so thin that objects move through it at perilously high speeds.Images taken by NASA’s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter show two new features on the surface of the planet that could be evidence of the crash. At the bottom of one close-up image, a bright white spot is thought to be the parachute used during Schiaparelli’s descent. Data suggests that parachute and the spacecraft’s heat shield were successfully deployed and discarded before the final phase of the landing. A dark patch, roughly 50-by-130 meters in area and little over half a mile north of the parachute, looks like material that was blown up when Schiaparelli hit the ground.The lander, part of the joint ExoMars astrobiology mission of the ESA and the Russian Federal Space Agency, would have been the first operable spacecraft from either agency to successfully touch down on the Martian surface.Schiaparelli hadn't been heard from since just before its planned landing, and by Thursday morning most scientists at ESA mission control feared the worst. The crash has overshadowed the successful orbital insertion of Schiaparelli's parent spacecraft, the Trace Gas Orbiter, which will circle the planet looking for methane for the next six years.Data from the orbiter is being analyzed to understand why the lander failed to achieve a soft landing. The ESA estimates that Schiaparelli began its free fall at a mile or two above the surface and was traveling more than 180 miles per hour when it hit the ground.The agency still doesn't know why the thrusters shut off prematurely.Determined to put a positive spin on things, ESA officials have repeatedly emphasized that Schiaparelli was designed as a test lander. It carried few scientific instruments and was only intended to last a few days on Mars. Its main objective was to test technologies such as the heat shield, parachute, radar and thrusters — which, one could argue it did, even though some of the technologies failed.“We got the data, we did the test, so I am very happy,” ESA director Jan Woerner said at a news conference Thursday.Even so, scientists and space enthusiasts are probably going to be pouring one out for Schiaparelli tonight.Read more:Dear Science: How did the planets get their names?The universe may have 10 times as many galaxies as we thoughtA comet smashing into ancient Earth may have set off catastrophic

       "7775  Update: As of 1 p.m. Eastern, scientists at European Space Operations Command received the first transmission from the Trace Gas Orbiter since it entered Mars orbit. The spacecraft is intact and seems to have completed its orbital insertion maneuver exactly according to plan. But the space agency is still waiting to hear from the Schiaparelli lander, which was scheduled to touch down at 10:48 a.m. Eastern. The spacecraft sent a communication indicating its parachutes had deployed during the descent, but the two transmissions since have been too faint or inconclusive for scientists to determine whether Schiaparelli is functional.The Schiaparelli lander, a small, saucer-shaped spacecraft equipped with an array of weather sensors, has already traveled farther than any meteorologist has ever gone. Seven months ago, it launched from a desert in Kazakhstan, and it has traveled 500 million miles to reach its current spot in the skies above Mars. On Monday, it successfully separated from its parent spacecraft, the Trace Gas Orbiter (TGO) that will relay signals from the surface and scan the red planet's atmosphere for an important signature of life.On Wednesday the intrepid spacecraft will attempt its most daring feat yet: Landing on a foreign planet, smack in the middle of a dust storm, to check out the weather up there.The orbiter and lander are part of the ExoMars mission, a joint project of the European Space Agency and the Russian Federal Space Agency aimed at assessing Mars's habitability, investigating its geology and atmosphere, searching for biosignatures, and testing the technology that will get scientists closer to examining real samples from the surface. In 2020, using data from TGO and Schiaparelli, the space agencies are scheduled to launch a rover capable of tracking down signs of past or present life on the planet — if any life ever existed.But first, the orbiter and lander need to get there.Both spacecraft are currently circling high above the planet, coasting toward the positions from which they will start their orbital insertions and landing. At 9:04 a.m. Eastern time, the TGO will begin a complex, two-hour series of engine burns designed to move it into orbit. For parts of this process, scientists on the ground will be completely out of touch with the orbiter. There is also a nine-minute time lag for communications between Earth and Mars. This means that the ExoMars team must trust in the programs it wrote for this maneuver more than a year ago.Once it has settled into orbit, TGO will spend the next six years \"sniffing\" Mars's atmosphere for gases that could tell us about conditions on the ground. Its main target is methane, a gas that has briefly, fleetingly been detected in the Martian air before. This is important because there are only two known sources of methane gas: geothermal activity, like the kind that occurs at ocean vents on Earth, or life. Either source would be of great interest to planetary scientists, since currently we have no evidence of current volcanic or biologic activity on the Mars.Shortly after TGO begins its orbital insertion, Schiaparelli will start its descent toward Mars. Over the course of the six-minute landing, it will rely on its heat shield, thrusters, a parachute and a crushable landing structure to keep it intact. It will also take a series of 15 black and white photos as it plummets toward the surface, allowing scientists to reconstruct the landing process.The ESA has produced a visualization of what Schiaparelli's descent will look like. It will also broadcast a live stream of the orbital entry and landings starting at 8 a.m. Eastern.If everything goes according to plan, Schiaparelli will be the first successful Mars landing for the European and Russian space agencies (previous attempts have failed to make it to the Red Planet or were unable to communicate once they got there).The lander lacks a rechargeable battery, so it has just a few days to collect all the data it needs. It will be touching down in the middle of the Martian dust-storm season, in a desolate plain marked by impact craters, volcanic rock and rare crystals of hematite that (on Earth, at least) usually form in the presence of liquid water.Schiaparelli's primary goal is to demonstrate the technologies needed for landing, but it carries a small suite of scientific instruments that will study things like wind speed, temperature, dust and other weather-related phenomena that will be needed to plan the second round of ExoMars missions.The landing will be “our own six minutes of terror,\" Francesca Ferri, a planetary scientist at the University of Padua in Italy, told Nature. She was referencing a phrase used to describe the landing of NASA’s Curiosity rover in 2012.“Around 50 percent of the landings on Mars haven’t succeeded, so it’s not easy,\" said Ferri, the principal investigator for an experiment that will study atmospheric data gathered during Schiaparelli's descent. \"But I’m feeling pretty confident.\"Read more:Dear Science: How did the planets get their names?The universe may have 10 times as many galaxies as we thoughtA comet smashing into ancient Earth may have set off catastrophic global warmingElon Musk unveils Mars colonization plan, but don't pack your bags just yet                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",
       "8057  Imagine if scientists found out that a massive asteroid was on a collision course with Earth and would strike somewhere near Los Angeles by September 2020. What could humanity do?Not much. At least, that was the result of a day-long tabletop exercise coordinated by NASA and FEMA late last month. In their hypothetical scenario, the space agency concluded that the 330-foot space rock was approaching too quickly to mount a deflection mission. The team from FEMA was left to figure out how to evacuate millions of people from Southern California.This was a purely fictional exercise. NASA has discovered some 17,000 potentially hazardous near-Earth objects, but none of them is projected to come close to Earth in the next hundred years. No human that we know of has been killed by a meteorite or the effects of an impact, and the likelihood that this could happen to any of us is very, very slim. The chance of an impact big enough to destroy our planet is even smaller. Remember that Earth has suffered only one mass extinction-inducing impact that we know of in its 4.6 billion-year history, and even that asteroid didn't end life entirely. Our planet is pretty resilient.Still, plenty of researchers don't want to simply wait around and see what happens. This week, more than 100 planetary scientists, physicists and engineers published an open letter in support of a joint European Space Agency (ESA) and NASA mission to survey a near-Earth asteroid and attempt to deflect it.“Unlike other natural disasters, this is one we know how to predict and potentially prevent with early discovery,” the letter reads. “As such, it is crucial to our knowledge and understanding of asteroids to determine whether a kinetic impactor is able to deflect the orbit of such a small body, in case Earth is threatened. This is what AIDA [an Asteroid Impact and Deflection Assessment mission] will help us assess.”In early December, ESA's council of ministers will meet to decide on funding for the first half of the AIDA mission.ESA's half of the joint project with NASA is called the Asteroid Impact Mission (AIM). It would launch a spacecraft in 2020 to the Didymos asteroid and its “moonlet,” known as Didymoon. The pair of space rocks is expected to pass within 10 million miles of Earth around 2022. From an interplanetary perspective, that's a hair's breadth.The smaller of the two bodies — 550-foot wide Didymoon — is AIM's target. The spacecraft would release a probe to land on the rock's surface, as well as two satellites to orbit around it.Four months later, a NASA spacecraft would complete the second part of the mission with a Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART). With the ESA satellites watching, the DART spacecraft is scheduled to slam into Didymoon and attempt to knock it off course.Aside from demonstrating NASA's over-the-top love for acronyms, the two-part mission would provide proof-of-concept for the idea that a “kinetic impactor” can change the trajectory of a rock in space — that is, if it works. In the remote possibility that it becomes necessary, NASA might one day use this technique to shift an asteroid away from Earth's orbit.“New NEOs [near-Earth objects] are now being discovered at the rate of some four per day,” Alan Harris, a letter signatory and senior scientist at German Aerospace Center, noted at a news conference. “We need a coordinated international strategy for near-Earth object impact mitigation.”Many asteroid researchers say that the Chelyabinsk meteor strike, which injured at least 1,200 people in the Ural Mountains in Russia in 2013, was something of a wake up call. It's estimated that the rock weighed about 10 tons and was about 65 feet across when it broke up in the sky above the city of Chelyabinsk. That no one died is largely a product of the remote location and incredible luck.An analysis of the meteor published later that year suggested that dangerous strikes could be more common than many of us realized.The timing of the mission is important, AIM supporters say, because the Didymos pair's orbit won't bring it this close to Earth's again for another 100 years.“It is a very unique opportunity,” Cornelius Schalinski, deputy head of business development for OHB, a German private space company helping to implement AIM, told Space.com. “It has to go in 2020. Otherwise, the opportunity is lost. It is an asteroid that gets pretty close to Earth, so we can, with comparatively small cost and effort, test technologies that we need for future missions that are farther away.”At 250 million euros (about $265 million), AIM is considered a low-cost mission. But it faces some technical challenges. For one thing, scientists barely know anything about Didymoon's shape or composition, because its small size makes it difficult to image. The (relatively) tiny rock also has barely any gravity — according to Space.com, if you jumped on it you wouldn't come back down, but instead float off into space — making it hard to ensure a lander stays put on its surface.But ESA's recent Rosetta mission, which ended earlier this year, demonstrated that the space agency could plop a lander down on a very small body. Granted, the comet visited by Rosetta was about two miles across, not 550 feet. But the authors of the open letter say Rosetta was a big step toward what AIM hopes to achieve.Beyond demonstrating the potential for deflection, the joint ESA-NASA mission will also help scientists better understand asteroids — ancient chunks of material left over from the earliest days of the solar system.“We want to make sure that the heritage of Rosetta, in terms of technology and expertise, continues — leading to new missions and further innovation,” the letter said. “As citizens of our solar system, we need to expand our body of knowledge of the universe in which we live.”Read more:At the ‘Crater of Doom,’ geologists dig up rocks from the day the dinosaurs diedAncient Swedish space rock may be a whole new kind of meteoriteAsteroids splashed into the young moon — and they may be the source of its waterThis strange, tailless comet could teach us about Earth’s originsThis asteroid almost certainly isn't going to crash into Earth and kill us all                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",

       "      <td>It's a big year for women in politics.In a historic first, Hillary Clinton was named the Democratic Party’s presidential nominee in the upcoming U.S. elections. If she wins, she will join Theresa May of Britain and Angela Merkel of Germany in the ranks of women who lead prominent Western democracies.They're not alone, either. In recent years, the number of women holding positions in both parliament and executive government has grown. As of June 2016, women’s membership in parliament doubled from 11.3 percent in 1995 to 22.1 percent in 2015, according to a recent study by the Inter-Parliamentary Union.And this year alone, there have been many historic firsts.In Iran, women won 17 seats during the Islamic Republic’s parliamentary elections in February. “This is a record and we are happy that our dear women are taking part in all stages, especially in politics,” Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said in a speech back in May.Africa has had some of the most dramatic breakthroughs over the past 20 years. As of June, four African nations were part of the top 10 as far as the number of women represented in parliament. Rwanda, for example, tops the chart as the country with the highest number of women represented in parliament in both the lower (63.8 percent) and upper houses (38.5 percent) in 2016.But women remain a relatively small group in parliaments around the world, and progress is slow. Data from the IPU shows that in a vast majority of countries, men still dominate the political stage. In both the lower and upper houses combined, women around the world account for around 22 percent of seats held in parliament.\"Yes it is an improvement considering that it started at a low base,\" Executive Director of U.N. Women Phumzile Mlambo Ngcuka said. \"But if we continue at this pace, it's going to take us too long. We need to fast-track the attainment of gender equality.\"The U.S. is one country that lags the global average of women in the national legislature. It ranks behind 95 countries, including low- and middle-income countries such as Ethiopia, El Salvador and Suriname. Other countries that outperform the United States include Iraq, Afghanistan and Saudi Arabia.One way that countries have been fast-tracking female participation in politics is through gender quotas, and the results have left many surprised. Countries that that have relatively low socioeconomic development or have just emerged from conflict, such as Afghanistan, Tanzania and Ecuador, have shown tremendous improvement and have higher levels of female representation in parliaments.Jennifer Rosen, assistant professor of sociology at Pepperdine University, says emerging democracies give leaders a unique opportunity for leaders to enshrine gender quotas in their new constitutions, helping bypass cultural barriers that would have otherwise stood in the way of women participating in politics for many years.Different electoral systems also influence women's participation in parliament. While scholars agree that proportional representation systems, which allow people to vote for a party list rather than a particular candidate, have a positive influence on female representation in government, some are divided as to whether it has a positive impact on all countries or only on Western democracies.One way for countries to shift their mentalities is to encourage people in executive leadership positions to set an example, Rosen said. Ngcuka, the U.N. women executive director, agrees and said men play an important role and that women shouldn't be the only ones trying to \"move the glass ceiling,\" noting how attitudes change when influential leaders such as Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau nominated a cabinet in 2015 that was half-female.Political parties that are supposed to provide gender quotas need to ensure that they place women in winnable positions, IPU Secretary General Martin Chungong said. \"In many instances they are not walking the walk,\" he said. \"It's not enough to have quotas. We need to provide incentives for people who don't want to implement them.\"What's also clear is that having women in national legislatures can change the way a country is governed. Research shows that when women participate in politics, the conversation gets steered toward issues that their male counterparts often fail to address, such as family planning, education and gender-based violence.\"We have seen that there are certain issues women are better able to articulate,\" Chungong said. \"Women tend to take leading roles not because it is a women's issue, but because it has to do with livelihood of society as a whole.\" More on WorldViewsThe world is getting better at paid maternity leave.

       "      <td>In a highly-anticipated session on “Gender-driven Growth” at the World Economic Forum, Facebook’s Sheryl Sandberg seemed to rule out a run for political office, while the IMF’s Christine Lagarde said that quotas were needed to ensure that women get to the top.This discussion took place Saturday, on the last day of the annual meeting in the tony ski resort of Davos, Switzerland, where more than 2,500 of the world’s leaders in economics, politics, business and media gathered for five days of meetings, social events and skiing.After agreeing that the persistent gender gap is due to “a lot” of discrimination, BBC News correspondent and moderator Linda Yueh wanted to know how best to close this gap. Should companies be held to a quota?Lagarde, a lawyer and the first woman to head the International Monetary Fund, said that she used to be totally opposed to gender quotas, finding them offensive. Now, she’s completely changed her mind and is “pro gender quotas,” arguing that “we need targets.”Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka, the undersecretary-general and executive director of UN Women, agreed. “We may not like them,” she acknowledged, “but for now, unfortunately, we need them.” In defending her support of quotas, Mlambo-Ngcuka said that “there’s an assumption that men are there because they’re good.”Carlos Ghosn, chairman and chief executive officer of Renault-Nissan and the only male on the panel, said that Nissan had to go to quotas in Japan to get around the “obvious discrimination.” Although training and coaching women are the most important steps for a company to take, he said that quotas “are important because they lead to action.”(Although the panelists didn’t mention it, the World Economic Forum, itself, established a quota for women two years ago. Despite this, however, women make up a lower percentage of attendees now than before the quota was introduced.)While the other panelists seemed to be effusive in their praise of quotas, Sandberg remained almost uncomfortably silent. And, Yueh didn’t push her.Comments Sandberg’s made over the years, however, show that she’s firmly opposed to using quotas as a way to get women to the top. For example, in response to a question during an NPR interview about whether she felt that she’d been “chosen” as one of the few women talented enough to reach the top, Sandberg said: “It used to be the case, that … there was only room for one or two. Women would look at each other in a room and know that because they were tokens only one of them was getting promoted. … And they were competitive with each other, or at least that’s what I’ve been told.”In her book “Lean In: Women, Work and the Will to Lead,” written with Nell Scovell, Sandberg recounts her anger at being asked whether “it must have helped to be a woman” when Larry Summers, who had been her adviser at Harvard, made her his chief of staff at the Treasury Department in 1999. “It was infuriating,” Sandberg writes. “Their intent may not have been malicious, but the implication was clear. I had not gotten the job on merit.” If the Treasury Department had had an affirmative action program, which it didn’t, Sandberg might have been on shakier ground in defending her promotion.In other words, a quota system risks labeling a woman as a “token” board member, senior executive, or whatever, rather than allowing the woman to be seen as achieving the position on merit.Though she doesn’t support quotas, Sandberg recognizes that women face many overt and covert barriers to getting ahead and cites numerous studies showing that whenever gender is taken out of the issue women do much better. Orchestras that hold blind auditions hire more women; identical resumes with a man’s name are viewed more favorably than those with a woman’s name; students evaluated a Harvard business school case study with Heidi as the entrepreneur much more harshly than when Howard was the entrepreneur; both males and females evaluating job applicants give higher marks to the male applicant, and so on.As Sandberg said in Davos, “If we take gender out, every time women do better.”The session also addressed women and politics. After acknowledging the presence of her good friend Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.) in the audience, Sandberg referred to reports that with 20 members out of 100, women are taking over the Senate. “It’s not a takeover, it’s a problem!” she joked.Lagarde, who is a former French finance minister, lamented that “There aren’t enough women in politics. And, when there are, they do better.”Mlambo-Ngcuka, who had said earlier that the world would be at peace and we’d have better security if more women were in charge, said “it’s important for women to elect women.”At that point, all eyes turned to Sandberg, where there’s been speculation that a run for political office is her inevitable next step.The BBC News moderator asked Sandberg straight out: “Is politics for you?”“Not for me,” Sandberg replied. “I just have a wholesale agreement that we need more women in politics.”</td>\n",

       "      <td>It's a big year for women in politics.In a historic first, Hillary Clinton was named the Democratic Party’s presidential nominee in the upcoming U.S. elections. If she wins, she will join Theresa May of Britain and Angela Merkel of Germany in the ranks of women who lead prominent Western democracies.They're not alone, either. In recent years, the number of women holding positions in both parliament and executive government has grown. As of June 2016, women’s membership in parliament doubled from 11.3 percent in 1995 to 22.1 percent in 2015, according to a recent study by the Inter-Parliamentary Union.And this year alone, there have been many historic firsts.In Iran, women won 17 seats during the Islamic Republic’s parliamentary elections in February. “This is a record and we are happy that our dear women are taking part in all stages, especially in politics,” Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said in a speech back in May.Africa has had some of the most dramatic breakthroughs over the past 20 years. As of June, four African nations were part of the top 10 as far as the number of women represented in parliament. Rwanda, for example, tops the chart as the country with the highest number of women represented in parliament in both the lower (63.8 percent) and upper houses (38.5 percent) in 2016.But women remain a relatively small group in parliaments around the world, and progress is slow. Data from the IPU shows that in a vast majority of countries, men still dominate the political stage. In both the lower and upper houses combined, women around the world account for around 22 percent of seats held in parliament.\"Yes it is an improvement considering that it started at a low base,\" Executive Director of U.N. Women Phumzile Mlambo Ngcuka said. \"But if we continue at this pace, it's going to take us too long. We need to fast-track the attainment of gender equality.\"The U.S. is one country that lags the global average of women in the national legislature. It ranks behind 95 countries, including low- and middle-income countries such as Ethiopia, El Salvador and Suriname. Other countries that outperform the United States include Iraq, Afghanistan and Saudi Arabia.One way that countries have been fast-tracking female participation in politics is through gender quotas, and the results have left many surprised. Countries that that have relatively low socioeconomic development or have just emerged from conflict, such as Afghanistan, Tanzania and Ecuador, have shown tremendous improvement and have higher levels of female representation in parliaments.Jennifer Rosen, assistant professor of sociology at Pepperdine University, says emerging democracies give leaders a unique opportunity for leaders to enshrine gender quotas in their new constitutions, helping bypass cultural barriers that would have otherwise stood in the way of women participating in politics for many years.Different electoral systems also influence women's participation in parliament. While scholars agree that proportional representation systems, which allow people to vote for a party list rather than a particular candidate, have a positive influence on female representation in government, some are divided as to whether it has a positive impact on all countries or only on Western democracies.One way for countries to shift their mentalities is to encourage people in executive leadership positions to set an example, Rosen said. Ngcuka, the U.N. women executive director, agrees and said men play an important role and that women shouldn't be the only ones trying to \"move the glass ceiling,\" noting how attitudes change when influential leaders such as Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau nominated a cabinet in 2015 that was half-female.Political parties that are supposed to provide gender quotas need to ensure that they place women in winnable positions, IPU Secretary General Martin Chungong said. \"In many instances they are not walking the walk,\" he said. \"It's not enough to have quotas. We need to provide incentives for people who don't want to implement them.\"What's also clear is that having women in national legislatures can change the way a country is governed. Research shows that when women participate in politics, the conversation gets steered toward issues that their male counterparts often fail to address, such as family planning, education and gender-based violence.\"We have seen that there are certain issues women are better able to articulate,\" Chungong said. \"Women tend to take leading roles not because it is a women's issue, but because it has to do with livelihood of society as a whole.\" More on WorldViewsThe world is getting better at paid maternity leave.

       "      <td>The barriers to women’s political participation in the Middle East have long preoccupied scholars and analysts. The Arab uprisings of early 2011 disrupted virtually every dimension of Arab politics and societies, forcing a systematic reevaluation of many long-held political science theories and assumptions. The place of women in politics and the public sphere was no exception.The divergent experiences of the Arab uprisings and their aftermath have allowed political scientists to take a fresh look at many of these important questions. New data sources and a diversity of cases have energized the community of scholars focused on women’s public political participation. A workshop of the Project on Middle East Political Science (POMEPS) brought together an interdisciplinary group of more than a dozen such scholars in March to critically examine these questions. The complete collection is available to be downloaded free here.Women were highly visible participants in the Arab uprisings of 2011, from the demonstrators on the front lines of Tahrir Square in Cairo to Nobel Peace Prize-winner Tawakkol Karman, the face of the revolution in Yemen. Women’s physical participation in those protests, as Sherine Hafez has observed, became a major point of contention, with narratives of emancipation clashing with experiences of mass public sexual harassment and the gendered exercise of state violence in the form of “virginity tests.”The transitions that followed those uprisings posed particularly fierce challenges to women. The early electoral successes of Islamist parties in Egypt and Tunisia drove many feminists, liberals and Western media platforms to voice concern that the new governments would diminish women’s rights and limit political freedoms. Those fears, as Ellen McLarney documents, escalated with the bitterly contentious negotiations over new constitutions.Many advocates feared that other laws protecting women’s rights, particularly within the family, might also be changed. Autocratic regimes strategically supported certain initiatives that – at least superficially – advanced women’s rights. In Egypt, as Mervat Hatem notes, former first lady Suzanne Mubarak formed the National Council for Women in 2000 that helped pass several laws increasing women’s and girls’ rights in the following decade. Tunisia under President Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali was often held up as a beacon for Western-style women’s empowerment in the region, as the regime focused international attention on women’s rights legislation and away from its systematic repression – which, as Hind Ahmed Zaki documents, included large-scale sexual abuse of female activists.Some women’s rights activists therefore worried that the democratic empowerment of conservative Islamists would come at the expense of their hard-won progress. Many were concerned that the new constitution created under the leadership of former president Mohamed Morsi in 2012 would roll back some of these advances. They were not reassured that, as Ellen McLarney describes, many of the contested sections describing women’s role in the family and society actually originate – some verbatim – in Nasser-era “secular” constitutions and even have roots in the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights.Such politicization of women’s rights was nothing new, of course. As Sherine Hafez describes, both autocratic regimes and democratically elected Islamist governments alike have manipulated the language of women’s rights and utilized female bodies to justify and promote their political goals.But women’s activism, like most other forms of political mobilization in the aftermath of the 2011 uprisings, could not be as easily contained and appropriated as before. Samira Ibrahim sued the military for the sexual assault of its “virginity tests” and, although she was dismissed by Egyptian military leadership as “not like your daughter or mine,” eventually succeeded in revoking the practice.Despite regional authoritarian backsliding as some of the former ruling elite regain power, women’s social organization and political mobilization continue to have an impact in the region. Vickie Langohr illustrates how new forms of activism and large-scale expansion of satellite media have begun to change the public discourse concerning sexual violence in Egypt. Hind Ahmed Zaki describes the Truth and Dignity Commission in Tunisia, which has given women the opportunity to tell their stories of systematic state sexual violence under the Ben Ali regime – although not, as yet, to win prosecution of their abusers.A wide-ranging political science literature on the challenges facing women’s political participation has highlighted variables such as Islamist movements, discourses on nationalism and citizenship, patterns of state development and cultural norms of patriarchy. But these broad discussions often fail to account for disparities in women’s experiences, not only among different states, but also sub-nationally. The scholars in the POMEPS workshop have taken advantage of new data sources, new organizations and campaigns and variation to highlight the diversity of the experience of women across the region.For instance, as Lindsay Benstead points out, countries with almost identical – and relatively high – proportions of women in the formal labor force (such as Yemen, Libya, Tunisia and Morocco) have personal-status laws that range from the most progressive to some of the most conservative in the region.As performance on various indicators of gender equity differs dramatically even within individual countries, suggesting undifferentiated arguments about patriarchy as an explanatory variable without considering intersections of class, privilege or ethnicity is of limited value. Similarly, Scott Weiner’s examination of patriarchy and tribal relations in Kuwait and Oman finds that while kinship relations are highly politically salient in Kuwait, and probably have facilitated the country’s very low levels of female representation in parliament, it actually was the highest-ranked Arab country in the 2014 Global Gender Gap Report.In contrast, Morocco has one of the most progressive personal-status laws in the region and boasts one of the largest percentages of women in parliament, but the gap between male and female literacy in Morocco is second only to that of Yemen among 20 Arab countries. Zakia Salime’s examination of rural women known as the Sulaliyyates fighting for access to tribal land in Morocco illuminates how specific links in tribal communities between women’s subordination in the family and the public sphere work in a country with wide variations in performance on typical indicators of patriarchy.This lack of congruence among different indicators of discrimination leads Benstead to suggest that instead of using patriarchy as a blanket term, political scientists would be better served by learning from feminist theory, particularly Deniz Kandiyoti’s conception of a “patriarchal bargain.” In such a bargain, women’s status across a variety of fields is dependent on the outcome of their negotiations with men, and thus, in the same society, outcomes on various indicators of discrimination can vary widely.While more research is needed to determine how these indicators affect political discrimination, there is consensus about how to improve political representation. Broad cross-national research, such as that by Aili Marie Tripp and Alice Kang, has demonstrated the efficacy of gender quotas. Not only do quotas increase political representation, but, per Benstead’s argument, they also improve female citizens’ access to governmental resources. And although some argue that Western pressure for such quotas would only undermine their prospects, Sarah Bush and Amaney Jamal found little evidence for such an effect on popular perceptions.

       "      <td>So the U.K. has its second female prime minister. What policies put more women in power?</td>\n",
       "      <td>In becoming Britain’s second female prime minister, Theresa May has made the country just the sixth in Europe (and 17th in the world) to have had more than one female leader.May, like her female predecessor Margaret Thatcher, is a Conservative. Her party’s main rival, the Labour Party, has had a parade of white male leaders. Although Margaret Beckett and Harriet Harman served as interim Labour Party leaders, neither was elected to that post.Which party has better female representation: Conservative or Labour?So is the Conservative Party beating Labour 2 to 0 in representing women in politics, as former prime minister David Cameron quipped in his final Prime Minister’s Questions? Is it true that the Conservative Party, as Boris Johnson said last week, is “the most progressive party in Britain” when it comes to representing women? No, in at least two important ways.First, on the benches of the House of Commons, only 21 percent of Conservative Party MPs are women — less than half that of the Labour Party, whose MPS are now 43 percent women. In fact, for almost two decades, Labour has consistently had about twice the proportion of women as has the Conservative Party, as the graph below shows.Second, unlike the Conservatives, Labour has consistently used robust policies in selecting candidates to guarantee healthy female representation on their slate.Here’s how Britain’s Labour Party boosted female representation in Parliament More than 100 political parties around the world — including Labour — use what are called “gender quota.” Labour’s gender quota policy, called all-women shortlists, was first used for the 1997 election. It commits the party to considering only female candidates in at least half of all “winnable” seats that come open.The policy’s results were dramatic. That year, the proportion of women in the Parliamentary Labour Party went from 14 percent to 24 percent, and the number of women in parliament overall doubled from 60 to 120. Labour has continued to use all-women shortlists in selecting its candidates for general elections ever since, with one exception. During the 2001 election, a legal challenge made the practice illegal. But a Labour-dominated Parliament amended the Equality Act to accommodate the provision.Here’s how the British Conservative Party tried to boost female representation in Parliament By contrast, the Conservative Party’s attempts to increase the number of female MPs have been significantly less effective. From the mid-2000s, Conservative gender-equality activists pressured party leaders to pay more attention to the underrepresentation of women. May, now prime minister, co-founded one key effort: Women2win, an organization to encourage and support women entering into Conservative Party politics. As Sarah Childs, Paul Webb and Sally Marthaler argued in the journal Political Quarterly, these efforts were important in changing party attitudes.In fact, after being selected party leader in 2005, David Cameron spent much of his acceptance speech promising that the party will “change the scandalous under-representation of women in the Conservative Party.” Within the year, the party introduced what it called priority candidate list — or the “A-List,” of about 150 aspiring candidates, from which local party organizers were encouraged to select. The party promised that the A-List would be at least 50 percent women and that a “significant” proportion would be nonwhite, and also introduced rules for gender-balanced shortlisting during the candidate-selection process.In Political Quarterly, Rosie Campbell, Joni Lovenduski and Childs argued that Cameron’s increased emphasis on getting more women into Parliament was an important evolution of the Conservative Party, raising awareness within the party of the need to “modernize” and appeal to female voters. But relatively few local party constituencies (equivalent to, in the United States, a district party organization) selected women from the A-List, and it was abandoned altogether in 2012. While Conservative Party leaders encouraged them to voluntarily select all-female shortlists themselves, no local party chose to do so. Although more Conservative women were elected in 2010, they still made up only a modest 16 percent of Conservative MPs, a bit more than half of Labour’s 31 percent.So what kinds of policies actually lead to gender equality in politics? Lovenduski in her book “Feminizing Politics” puts attempts to tackle women’s political underrepresentation into three categories: equality rhetoric, equality promotion and equality guarantees. While the Conservative Party in the past decade has had plenty of equality rhetoric and promotion — which Lovenduski considers important steps toward “feminizing politics” — it has stopped short of guaranteeing equality. Labour, by contrast, took steps to guarantee equal representation. Political scientists, such as Mona Lena Krook, have consistently found that robust equality guarantees in the form of gender quotas are the surest route to increasing women’s representation at all levels in politics. The results can be counted.Of course, only the Conservative Party has put women into the top spotIt’s true that the Conservative Party has now put women in the most exceptional position in Britain: that of prime minister. But it has not gone far in diversifying its gender composition. As Diana O’Brien and Karen Beckwith wrote here earlier this week, both Thatcher and May came to power after political crises, which is often the way women become political leaders. That might soon happen in the Labour Party as well; if Angela Eagle succeeds in challenging Jeremy Corbyn for leader, she too may take over at a time of organizational disaster.In other words, even women’s rise to the top of the party may not indicate a commitment to institutional change; rather, it’s a product of political convenience and circumstance.Nugent is a PhD candidate at Rutgers University at New Brunswick, studying women and politics.

       "      <td>On Sunday, more than 70 world leaders are expected to participate in a United Nations meeting in New York on gender equality, a 20th anniversary commemoration of the most important United Nations conference on women that was held in Beijing in September 1995 and attended by 37,000 national representatives, U.N. officials, and women’s rights activists. At the Beijing conference, first lady Hillary Clinton famously asserted, “Women’s rights are human rights,” which to this day has inspired women’s mobilization around the globe.But while women around the world were energized in 1995 to take steps to improve their status, the United States has fallen behind in many key areas. When ranked according to women’s legislative representation, the United States slid from 53rd to 76th place in the world over the past 20 years.One of the most enduring legacies of the Beijing conference was that its “Platform for Action” galvanized governments to start adopting measures to increase the political representation of women and to increase their capacity to participate fully in decision-making and leadership. As a result, the proportion of women parliamentarians jumped from 9 percent in 1995 to 22 percent today, according to the Inter-Parliamentary Union.Inspired by the Platform for Action, women’s activists, party activists, and government officials lobbied for the adoption of gender quotas, mandates that increase the likelihood that women are elected to office, usually by requiring a certain percentage of women candidates or reserving women-only seats in the legislature. Countries adopting quotas include both dictatorships and democracies and range from very poor to very rich.Some of the countries with the highest rates of women’s representation are post-conflict countries that adopted quotas. For example, after the genocide in Rwanda, the percent of female parliamentarians leaped spectacularly from 17 percent in 1994 to 64 percent in 2014, the highest level of representation of women in the world today.Today, political parties or governments in more than 111 countries use some form of quota in legislative elections. According to the Quota Project’s latest information, in 49 countries, political parties that are represented in parliament have voluntarily adopted quotas; 52 countries have passed legislation requiring all parties to adopt a quota system; and 24 countries have reserved seats that only women can run for, regardless of party affiliation.We examined the global impact of gender quotas on women’s representation in our 2008 study of 153 countries. Controlling for other factors previously shown to have an impact on representation (e.g., type of electoral system), we found gender quotas to be the strongest factor influencing women’s legislative representation.Even in countries with predominantly Muslim populations that were seen as lagging behind other countries when it came to women’s entry into politics, we began to see significant changes as more countries adopted gender quotas, especially after 2010. For example, women today hold 43 percent of the seats in parliament in predominantly Muslim Senegal. In North Africa the changes are palpable, as women hold 32 percent and 31 percent of the seats in Algeria and Tunisia respectively, which is considerably higher than the 19 percent level found in the United States House (20 percent in the Senate).In the United States and other countries, arguments are raised against gender quotas, but many don’t stand up to scrutiny. For example, the argument that only the most qualified individuals should hold positions of power ignores the fact that parties and leaders often take into consideration other factors, such as geographic representation, and unconsciously or consciously tend to recruit candidates from their own male-dominated networks.In spite of what detractors say, studies show that women who benefit from quotas are as qualified as men. Research by political scientists Susan Franceschet, Jennifer Piscopo, and Diana O’Brien in a recent edited volume finds that male and female lawmakers have similar levels of education or previous electoral experience in countries as diverse as Argentina and Uganda. Both countries have used gender quotas for more than two decades.Another concern about gender quotas is that once in office, female lawmakers may be too timid or too powerless to affect change, but this may have more to do with party dynamics or the national context – where not just female but also male lawmakers encounter obstacles in affecting change.The concern that women may be too inexperienced or uneducated to hold office is challenged by studies of quotas in the world’s largest democracy, India. One widely cited study by Raghabendra Chattopadhyay and Esther Duflo finds that women in positions of power on local village councils respond to women’s demands more so than their male counterparts in the states of West Bengal and Rajasthan. Similarly, research by Lori Beaman and her colleagues finds that the mandated presence of women in politics has a positive impact on voter attitudes to female leaders and girls’ career aspirations and educational outcomes. The gender quotas in the local government gram panchayats were so successful that the government allowed states to increase female representation from 30 percent to 50 percent at all local government levels.Today, quotas have expanded to other areas, such as corporate boards, election commissions, executive cabinets, and the judiciary. International bodies, such as the African Union and the International Criminal Court, have affirmative action principles embedded in them. Quotas have also been used to promote the representation of those living with disabilities and ethnic minorities.Yet, even with increased efforts to boost women’s political representation, the gender gap in politics is one of the largest, especially compared with the gender gap in education and health, where according to the World Economic Forum, it has narrowed considerably. Still today, only 11 heads of state and 13 heads of government are female, while only 17 percent of government ministers are women according to UN Women.An American sounded the clarion call for women’s mobilization two decades ago at the U.N. Beijing Conference. Yet ironically in the United States there is virtually no debate around how to increase women’s political representation as we fall further behind other countries. If something is to be learned from the rest of the world, it is that the introduction of gender quotas has brought more women into political leadership.****Aili Mari Tripp is professor of political science and gender &amp; women’s studies at the University of Wisconsin at Madison.

       "0  In a highly-anticipated session on “Gender-driven Growth” at the World Economic Forum, Facebook’s Sheryl Sandberg seemed to rule out a run for political office, while the IMF’s Christine Lagarde said that quotas were needed to ensure that women get to the top.This discussion took place Saturday, on the last day of the annual meeting in the tony ski resort of Davos, Switzerland, where more than 2,500 of the world’s leaders in economics, politics, business and media gathered for five days of meetings, social events and skiing.After agreeing that the persistent gender gap is due to “a lot” of discrimination, BBC News correspondent and moderator Linda Yueh wanted to know how best to close this gap. Should companies be held to a quota?Lagarde, a lawyer and the first woman to head the International Monetary Fund, said that she used to be totally opposed to gender quotas, finding them offensive. Now, she’s completely changed her mind and is “pro gender quotas,” arguing that “we need targets.”Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka, the undersecretary-general and executive director of UN Women, agreed. “We may not like them,” she acknowledged, “but for now, unfortunately, we need them.” In defending her support of quotas, Mlambo-Ngcuka said that “there’s an assumption that men are there because they’re good.”Carlos Ghosn, chairman and chief executive officer of Renault-Nissan and the only male on the panel, said that Nissan had to go to quotas in Japan to get around the “obvious discrimination.” Although training and coaching women are the most important steps for a company to take, he said that quotas “are important because they lead to action.”(Although the panelists didn’t mention it, the World Economic Forum, itself, established a quota for women two years ago. Despite this, however, women make up a lower percentage of attendees now than before the quota was introduced.)While the other panelists seemed to be effusive in their praise of quotas, Sandberg remained almost uncomfortably silent. And, Yueh didn’t push her.Comments Sandberg’s made over the years, however, show that she’s firmly opposed to using quotas as a way to get women to the top. For example, in response to a question during an NPR interview about whether she felt that she’d been “chosen” as one of the few women talented enough to reach the top, Sandberg said: “It used to be the case, that … there was only room for one or two. Women would look at each other in a room and know that because they were tokens only one of them was getting promoted. … And they were competitive with each other, or at least that’s what I’ve been told.”In her book “Lean In: Women, Work and the Will to Lead,” written with Nell Scovell, Sandberg recounts her anger at being asked whether “it must have helped to be a woman” when Larry Summers, who had been her adviser at Harvard, made her his chief of staff at the Treasury Department in 1999. “It was infuriating,” Sandberg writes. “Their intent may not have been malicious, but the implication was clear. I had not gotten the job on merit.” If the Treasury Department had had an affirmative action program, which it didn’t, Sandberg might have been on shakier ground in defending her promotion.In other words, a quota system risks labeling a woman as a “token” board member, senior executive, or whatever, rather than allowing the woman to be seen as achieving the position on merit.Though she doesn’t support quotas, Sandberg recognizes that women face many overt and covert barriers to getting ahead and cites numerous studies showing that whenever gender is taken out of the issue women do much better. Orchestras that hold blind auditions hire more women; identical resumes with a man’s name are viewed more favorably than those with a woman’s name; students evaluated a Harvard business school case study with Heidi as the entrepreneur much more harshly than when Howard was the entrepreneur; both males and females evaluating job applicants give higher marks to the male applicant, and so on.As Sandberg said in Davos, “If we take gender out, every time women do better.”The session also addressed women and politics. After acknowledging the presence of her good friend Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.) in the audience, Sandberg referred to reports that with 20 members out of 100, women are taking over the Senate. “It’s not a takeover, it’s a problem!” she joked.Lagarde, who is a former French finance minister, lamented that “There aren’t enough women in politics. And, when there are, they do better.”Mlambo-Ngcuka, who had said earlier that the world would be at peace and we’d have better security if more women were in charge, said “it’s important for women to elect women.”At that point, all eyes turned to Sandberg, where there’s been speculation that a run for political office is her inevitable next step.The BBC News moderator asked Sandberg straight out: “Is politics for you?”“Not for me,” Sandberg replied. “I just have a wholesale agreement that we need more women in politics.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",
       "1  It's a big year for women in politics.In a historic first, Hillary Clinton was named the Democratic Party’s presidential nominee in the upcoming U.S. elections. If she wins, she will join Theresa May of Britain and Angela Merkel of Germany in the ranks of women who lead prominent Western democracies.They're not alone, either. In recent years, the number of women holding positions in both parliament and executive government has grown. As of June 2016, women’s membership in parliament doubled from 11.3 percent in 1995 to 22.1 percent in 2015, according to a recent study by the Inter-Parliamentary Union.And this year alone, there have been many historic firsts.In Iran, women won 17 seats during the Islamic Republic’s parliamentary elections in February. “This is a record and we are happy that our dear women are taking part in all stages, especially in politics,” Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said in a speech back in May.Africa has had some of the most dramatic breakthroughs over the past 20 years. As of June, four African nations were part of the top 10 as far as the number of women represented in parliament. Rwanda, for example, tops the chart as the country with the highest number of women represented in parliament in both the lower (63.8 percent) and upper houses (38.5 percent) in 2016.But women remain a relatively small group in parliaments around the world, and progress is slow. Data from the IPU shows that in a vast majority of countries, men still dominate the political stage. In both the lower and upper houses combined, women around the world account for around 22 percent of seats held in parliament.\"Yes it is an improvement considering that it started at a low base,\" Executive Director of U.N. Women Phumzile Mlambo Ngcuka said. \"But if we continue at this pace, it's going to take us too long. We need to fast-track the attainment of gender equality.\"The U.S. is one country that lags the global average of women in the national legislature. It ranks behind 95 countries, including low- and middle-income countries such as Ethiopia, El Salvador and Suriname. Other countries that outperform the United States include Iraq, Afghanistan and Saudi Arabia.One way that countries have been fast-tracking female participation in politics is through gender quotas, and the results have left many surprised. Countries that that have relatively low socioeconomic development or have just emerged from conflict, such as Afghanistan, Tanzania and Ecuador, have shown tremendous improvement and have higher levels of female representation in parliaments.Jennifer Rosen, assistant professor of sociology at Pepperdine University, says emerging democracies give leaders a unique opportunity for leaders to enshrine gender quotas in their new constitutions, helping bypass cultural barriers that would have otherwise stood in the way of women participating in politics for many years.Different electoral systems also influence women's participation in parliament. While scholars agree that proportional representation systems, which allow people to vote for a party list rather than a particular candidate, have a positive influence on female representation in government, some are divided as to whether it has a positive impact on all countries or only on Western democracies.One way for countries to shift their mentalities is to encourage people in executive leadership positions to set an example, Rosen said. Ngcuka, the U.N. women executive director, agrees and said men play an important role and that women shouldn't be the only ones trying to \"move the glass ceiling,\" noting how attitudes change when influential leaders such as Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau nominated a cabinet in 2015 that was half-female.Political parties that are supposed to provide gender quotas need to ensure that they place women in winnable positions, IPU Secretary General Martin Chungong said. \"In many instances they are not walking the walk,\" he said. \"It's not enough to have quotas. We need to provide incentives for people who don't want to implement them.\"What's also clear is that having women in national legislatures can change the way a country is governed. Research shows that when women participate in politics, the conversation gets steered toward issues that their male counterparts often fail to address, such as family planning, education and gender-based violence.\"We have seen that there are certain issues women are better able to articulate,\" Chungong said. \"Women tend to take leading roles not because it is a women's issue, but because it has to do with livelihood of society as a whole.\" More on WorldViewsThe world is getting better at paid maternity leave.

       "2  The barriers to women’s political participation in the Middle East have long preoccupied scholars and analysts. The Arab uprisings of early 2011 disrupted virtually every dimension of Arab politics and societies, forcing a systematic reevaluation of many long-held political science theories and assumptions. The place of women in politics and the public sphere was no exception.The divergent experiences of the Arab uprisings and their aftermath have allowed political scientists to take a fresh look at many of these important questions. New data sources and a diversity of cases have energized the community of scholars focused on women’s public political participation. A workshop of the Project on Middle East Political Science (POMEPS) brought together an interdisciplinary group of more than a dozen such scholars in March to critically examine these questions. The complete collection is available to be downloaded free here.Women were highly visible participants in the Arab uprisings of 2011, from the demonstrators on the front lines of Tahrir Square in Cairo to Nobel Peace Prize-winner Tawakkol Karman, the face of the revolution in Yemen. Women’s physical participation in those protests, as Sherine Hafez has observed, became a major point of contention, with narratives of emancipation clashing with experiences of mass public sexual harassment and the gendered exercise of state violence in the form of “virginity tests.”The transitions that followed those uprisings posed particularly fierce challenges to women. The early electoral successes of Islamist parties in Egypt and Tunisia drove many feminists, liberals and Western media platforms to voice concern that the new governments would diminish women’s rights and limit political freedoms. Those fears, as Ellen McLarney documents, escalated with the bitterly contentious negotiations over new constitutions.Many advocates feared that other laws protecting women’s rights, particularly within the family, might also be changed. Autocratic regimes strategically supported certain initiatives that – at least superficially – advanced women’s rights. In Egypt, as Mervat Hatem notes, former first lady Suzanne Mubarak formed the National Council for Women in 2000 that helped pass several laws increasing women’s and girls’ rights in the following decade. Tunisia under President Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali was often held up as a beacon for Western-style women’s empowerment in the region, as the regime focused international attention on women’s rights legislation and away from its systematic repression – which, as Hind Ahmed Zaki documents, included large-scale sexual abuse of female activists.Some women’s rights activists therefore worried that the democratic empowerment of conservative Islamists would come at the expense of their hard-won progress. Many were concerned that the new constitution created under the leadership of former president Mohamed Morsi in 2012 would roll back some of these advances. They were not reassured that, as Ellen McLarney describes, many of the contested sections describing women’s role in the family and society actually originate – some verbatim – in Nasser-era “secular” constitutions and even have roots in the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights.Such politicization of women’s rights was nothing new, of course. As Sherine Hafez describes, both autocratic regimes and democratically elected Islamist governments alike have manipulated the language of women’s rights and utilized female bodies to justify and promote their political goals.But women’s activism, like most other forms of political mobilization in the aftermath of the 2011 uprisings, could not be as easily contained and appropriated as before. Samira Ibrahim sued the military for the sexual assault of its “virginity tests” and, although she was dismissed by Egyptian military leadership as “not like your daughter or mine,” eventually succeeded in revoking the practice.Despite regional authoritarian backsliding as some of the former ruling elite regain power, women’s social organization and political mobilization continue to have an impact in the region. Vickie Langohr illustrates how new forms of activism and large-scale expansion of satellite media have begun to change the public discourse concerning sexual violence in Egypt. Hind Ahmed Zaki describes the Truth and Dignity Commission in Tunisia, which has given women the opportunity to tell their stories of systematic state sexual violence under the Ben Ali regime – although not, as yet, to win prosecution of their abusers.A wide-ranging political science literature on the challenges facing women’s political participation has highlighted variables such as Islamist movements, discourses on nationalism and citizenship, patterns of state development and cultural norms of patriarchy. But these broad discussions often fail to account for disparities in women’s experiences, not only among different states, but also sub-nationally. The scholars in the POMEPS workshop have taken advantage of new data sources, new organizations and campaigns and variation to highlight the diversity of the experience of women across the region.For instance, as Lindsay Benstead points out, countries with almost identical – and relatively high – proportions of women in the formal labor force (such as Yemen, Libya, Tunisia and Morocco) have personal-status laws that range from the most progressive to some of the most conservative in the region.As performance on various indicators of gender equity differs dramatically even within individual countries, suggesting undifferentiated arguments about patriarchy as an explanatory variable without considering intersections of class, privilege or ethnicity is of limited value. Similarly, Scott Weiner’s examination of patriarchy and tribal relations in Kuwait and Oman finds that while kinship relations are highly politically salient in Kuwait, and probably have facilitated the country’s very low levels of female representation in parliament, it actually was the highest-ranked Arab country in the 2014 Global Gender Gap Report.In contrast, Morocco has one of the most progressive personal-status laws in the region and boasts one of the largest percentages of women in parliament, but the gap between male and female literacy in Morocco is second only to that of Yemen among 20 Arab countries. Zakia Salime’s examination of rural women known as the Sulaliyyates fighting for access to tribal land in Morocco illuminates how specific links in tribal communities between women’s subordination in the family and the public sphere work in a country with wide variations in performance on typical indicators of patriarchy.This lack of congruence among different indicators of discrimination leads Benstead to suggest that instead of using patriarchy as a blanket term, political scientists would be better served by learning from feminist theory, particularly Deniz Kandiyoti’s conception of a “patriarchal bargain.” In such a bargain, women’s status across a variety of fields is dependent on the outcome of their negotiations with men, and thus, in the same society, outcomes on various indicators of discrimination can vary widely.While more research is needed to determine how these indicators affect political discrimination, there is consensus about how to improve political representation. Broad cross-national research, such as that by Aili Marie Tripp and Alice Kang, has demonstrated the efficacy of gender quotas. Not only do quotas increase political representation, but, per Benstead’s argument, they also improve female citizens’ access to governmental resources. And although some argue that Western pressure for such quotas would only undermine their prospects, Sarah Bush and Amaney Jamal found little evidence for such an effect on popular perceptions. Although cynics might assume that women in Arab parliaments are merely a form of window dressing, Marwa Shalaby notes that while women make u  \n",
       "3  In becoming Britain’s second female prime minister, Theresa May has made the country just the sixth in Europe (and 17th in the world) to have had more than one female leader.May, like her female predecessor Margaret Thatcher, is a Conservative. Her party’s main rival, the Labour Party, has had a parade of white male leaders. Although Margaret Beckett and Harriet Harman served as interim Labour Party leaders, neither was elected to that post.Which party has better female representation: Conservative or Labour?So is the Conservative Party beating Labour 2 to 0 in representing women in politics, as former prime minister David Cameron quipped in his final Prime Minister’s Questions? Is it true that the Conservative Party, as Boris Johnson said last week, is “the most progressive party in Britain” when it comes to representing women? No, in at least two important ways.First, on the benches of the House of Commons, only 21 percent of Conservative Party MPs are women — less than half that of the Labour Party, whose MPS are now 43 percent women. In fact, for almost two decades, Labour has consistently had about twice the proportion of women as has the Conservative Party, as the graph below shows.Second, unlike the Conservatives, Labour has consistently used robust policies in selecting candidates to guarantee healthy female representation on their slate.Here’s how Britain’s Labour Party boosted female representation in Parliament More than 100 political parties around the world — including Labour — use what are called “gender quota.” Labour’s gender quota policy, called all-women shortlists, was first used for the 1997 election. It commits the party to considering only female candidates in at least half of all “winnable” seats that come open.The policy’s results were dramatic. That year, the proportion of women in the Parliamentary Labour Party went from 14 percent to 24 percent, and the number of women in parliament overall doubled from 60 to 120. Labour has continued to use all-women shortlists in selecting its candidates for general elections ever since, with one exception. During the 2001 election, a legal challenge made the practice illegal. But a Labour-dominated Parliament amended the Equality Act to accommodate the provision.Here’s how the British Conservative Party tried to boost female representation in Parliament By contrast, the Conservative Party’s attempts to increase the number of female MPs have been significantly less effective. From the mid-2000s, Conservative gender-equality activists pressured party leaders to pay more attention to the underrepresentation of women. May, now prime minister, co-founded one key effort: Women2win, an organization to encourage and support women entering into Conservative Party politics. As Sarah Childs, Paul Webb and Sally Marthaler argued in the journal Political Quarterly, these efforts were important in changing party attitudes.In fact, after being selected party leader in 2005, David Cameron spent much of his acceptance speech promising that the party will “change the scandalous under-representation of women in the Conservative Party.” Within the year, the party introduced what it called priority candidate list — or the “A-List,” of about 150 aspiring candidates, from which local party organizers were encouraged to select. The party promised that the A-List would be at least 50 percent women and that a “significant” proportion would be nonwhite, and also introduced rules for gender-balanced shortlisting during the candidate-selection process.In Political Quarterly, Rosie Campbell, Joni Lovenduski and Childs argued that Cameron’s increased emphasis on getting more women into Parliament was an important evolution of the Conservative Party, raising awareness within the party of the need to “modernize” and appeal to female voters. But relatively few local party constituencies (equivalent to, in the United States, a district party organization) selected women from the A-List, and it was abandoned altogether in 2012. While Conservative Party leaders encouraged them to voluntarily select all-female shortlists themselves, no local party chose to do so. Although more Conservative women were elected in 2010, they still made up only a modest 16 percent of Conservative MPs, a bit more than half of Labour’s 31 percent.So what kinds of policies actually lead to gender equality in politics? Lovenduski in her book “Feminizing Politics” puts attempts to tackle women’s political underrepresentation into three categories: equality rhetoric, equality promotion and equality guarantees. While the Conservative Party in the past decade has had plenty of equality rhetoric and promotion — which Lovenduski considers important steps toward “feminizing politics” — it has stopped short of guaranteeing equality. Labour, by contrast, took steps to guarantee equal representation. Political scientists, such as Mona Lena Krook, have consistently found that robust equality guarantees in the form of gender quotas are the surest route to increasing women’s representation at all levels in politics. The results can be counted.Of course, only the Conservative Party has put women into the top spotIt’s true that the Conservative Party has now put women in the most exceptional position in Britain: that of prime minister. But it has not gone far in diversifying its gender composition. As Diana O’Brien and Karen Beckwith wrote here earlier this week, both Thatcher and May came to power after political crises, which is often the way women become political leaders. That might soon happen in the Labour Party as well; if Angela Eagle succeeds in challenging Jeremy Corbyn for leader, she too may take over at a time of organizational disaster.In other words, even women’s rise to the top of the party may not indicate a commitment to institutional change; rather, it’s a product of political convenience and circumstance.Nugent is a PhD candidate at Rutgers University at New Brunswick, studying women and politics.

       "4  On Sunday, more than 70 world leaders are expected to participate in a United Nations meeting in New York on gender equality, a 20th anniversary commemoration of the most important United Nations conference on women that was held in Beijing in September 1995 and attended by 37,000 national representatives, U.N. officials, and women’s rights activists. At the Beijing conference, first lady Hillary Clinton famously asserted, “Women’s rights are human rights,” which to this day has inspired women’s mobilization around the globe.But while women around the world were energized in 1995 to take steps to improve their status, the United States has fallen behind in many key areas. When ranked according to women’s legislative representation, the United States slid from 53rd to 76th place in the world over the past 20 years.One of the most enduring legacies of the Beijing conference was that its “Platform for Action” galvanized governments to start adopting measures to increase the political representation of women and to increase their capacity to participate fully in decision-making and leadership. As a result, the proportion of women parliamentarians jumped from 9 percent in 1995 to 22 percent today, according to the Inter-Parliamentary Union.Inspired by the Platform for Action, women’s activists, party activists, and government officials lobbied for the adoption of gender quotas, mandates that increase the likelihood that women are elected to office, usually by requiring a certain percentage of women candidates or reserving women-only seats in the legislature. Countries adopting quotas include both dictatorships and democracies and range from very poor to very rich.Some of the countries with the highest rates of women’s representation are post-conflict countries that adopted quotas. For example, after the genocide in Rwanda, the percent of female parliamentarians leaped spectacularly from 17 percent in 1994 to 64 percent in 2014, the highest level of representation of women in the world today.Today, political parties or governments in more than 111 countries use some form of quota in legislative elections. According to the Quota Project’s latest information, in 49 countries, political parties that are represented in parliament have voluntarily adopted quotas; 52 countries have passed legislation requiring all parties to adopt a quota system; and 24 countries have reserved seats that only women can run for, regardless of party affiliation.We examined the global impact of gender quotas on women’s representation in our 2008 study of 153 countries. Controlling for other factors previously shown to have an impact on representation (e.g., type of electoral system), we found gender quotas to be the strongest factor influencing women’s legislative representation.Even in countries with predominantly Muslim populations that were seen as lagging behind other countries when it came to women’s entry into politics, we began to see significant changes as more countries adopted gender quotas, especially after 2010. For example, women today hold 43 percent of the seats in parliament in predominantly Muslim Senegal. In North Africa the changes are palpable, as women hold 32 percent and 31 percent of the seats in Algeria and Tunisia respectively, which is considerably higher than the 19 percent level found in the United States House (20 percent in the Senate).In the United States and other countries, arguments are raised against gender quotas, but many don’t stand up to scrutiny. For example, the argument that only the most qualified individuals should hold positions of power ignores the fact that parties and leaders often take into consideration other factors, such as geographic representation, and unconsciously or consciously tend to recruit candidates from their own male-dominated networks.In spite of what detractors say, studies show that women who benefit from quotas are as qualified as men. Research by political scientists Susan Franceschet, Jennifer Piscopo, and Diana O’Brien in a recent edited volume finds that male and female lawmakers have similar levels of education or previous electoral experience in countries as diverse as Argentina and Uganda. Both countries have used gender quotas for more than two decades.Another concern about gender quotas is that once in office, female lawmakers may be too timid or too powerless to affect change, but this may have more to do with party dynamics or the national context – where not just female but also male lawmakers encounter obstacles in affecting change.The concern that women may be too inexperienced or uneducated to hold office is challenged by studies of quotas in the world’s largest democracy, India. One widely cited study by Raghabendra Chattopadhyay and Esther Duflo finds that women in positions of power on local village councils respond to women’s demands more so than their male counterparts in the states of West Bengal and Rajasthan. Similarly, research by Lori Beaman and her colleagues finds that the mandated presence of women in politics has a positive impact on voter attitudes to female leaders and girls’ career aspirations and educational outcomes. The gender quotas in the local government gram panchayats were so successful that the government allowed states to increase female representation from 30 percent to 50 percent at all local government levels.Today, quotas have expanded to other areas, such as corporate boards, election commissions, executive cabinets, and the judiciary. International bodies, such as the African Union and the International Criminal Court, have affirmative action principles embedded in them. Quotas have also been used to promote the representation of those living with disabilities and ethnic minorities.Yet, even with increased efforts to boost women’s political representation, the gender gap in politics is one of the largest, especially compared with the gender gap in education and health, where according to the World Economic Forum, it has narrowed considerably. Still today, only 11 heads of state and 13 heads of government are female, while only 17 percent of government ministers are women according to UN Women.An American sounded the clarion call for women’s mobilization two decades ago at the U.N. Beijing Conference. Yet ironically in the United States there is virtually no debate around how to increase women’s political representation as we fall further behind other countries. If something is to be learned from the rest of the world, it is that the introduction of gender quotas has brought more women into political leadership.****Aili Mari Tripp is professor of political science and gender & women’s studies at the University of Wisconsin at Madison.

       "      <td>A record-breaking number of women were elected to the British Parliament in Thursday’s election, with many calling it a “historic” moment. When legislators return to Westminster next week, there will be 208 women among their ranks, or 32 percent of Parliament. The majority of the parties are also led by women. In fact, Prime Minister Theresa May is now negotiating with another woman, Arlene Foster of Northern Ireland’s Democratic Unionist Party, to form a government.But is this election really a turning point for women in the United Kingdom?Despite the headlines, these results represent only an incremental change — a gain of just 12 more seats for women. And although women might be better represented in Parliament than in the U.S. Congress, the United Kingdom still lags behind most European and Latin American democracies. Thursday’s election moved it from 46 to 39 in the global rankings. Focusing on the headline number also obscures significant variation across parties and regions.The parties aren’t alikeAs with the Democrats in the United States, women’s representation is highest in the center-left Labour Party. Women hold 45 percent of Labour seats (119 of 262) compared with 21 percent of Conservative seats. In fact, the number of women parliamentarians in the Conservative Party actually decreased from 70 to 67 in this election.The difference between the parties is because of a strategy — “all-women shortlists” — adopted by the Labour Party in 1994. Labour requires that half of all winnable seats be contested by female candidates. When it was partially implemented for the first time in 1997, women’s numbers grew from 37 to 101. Since being fully implemented from 2005 onwards, women’s representation has never fallen below 27 percent.Scotland is different, tooThere is also variation within the U.K. itself. Women’s representation actually decreased in Scotland. This is in large part because of the Conservative gains in the region: among the thirteen returning members of Parliament, only one is a woman. And this is despite the striking prominence of women in Scottish politics, where the leaders of the three major parties are all women, and First Minister Nicola Sturgeon appointed a gender-balanced Cabinet.The U.K. isn’t close to gender parityThe U.K. remains a long way from gender parity in Parliament. To get there, the Conservatives will have to increase the number of female candidates competing in winnable seats. They’ve tried to bolster women’s numbers before through “soft” measures — such as the Women2Win initiative co-founded by Theresa May to support and train Conservative women, and the gender balanced “priority list” of prospective candidates that local parties were encouraged to select from (although it proved unpopular and was soon abandoned).Despite acknowledging the need for more women in politics, the Conservative Party remains opposed to a strategy like all-women shortlists. Their resistance is not surprising. While there are right-leaning parties in Western Europe with voluntary quotas (including the German Christian Democrats and Austrian People’s Party), no conservative party in the region has been willing to implement this strategy.Moreover, Britain, unlike more than 75 countries across the globe, has not adopted legislation that mandates the selection or election of female candidates for office. A growing number of European countries have done so, including France in 1999, Ireland in 2012 and Poland in 2011.What comes next? One crucial issue on the agenda: women’s reproductive rights. The governing coalition will likely include the Conservative Party and Northern Ireland’s Democratic Unionist Party, and the DUP has consistently campaigned to limit abortion rights. The DUP’s former health minister, Jim Wells, has even argued against abortion in cases of rape. Newly elected MP Owen Paterson confirmed in an interview yesterday that abortion restrictions might be up for debate.At the same time, May’s position is precarious, and many observers do not expect this fragile coalition to last long. If new elections are on the horizon, then we will soon see whether there will be further increases in women’s representation — and if so, what that means for public policy.Mary Nugent is a PhD candidate in political science at Rutgers University.

       "      <td>When I went to Uganda in 1992, I was interested in understanding why the country had so many women in top government positions and why it had the highest rates of representation of women in parliament in Africa at the time. During my research, I realized that a key reason was war. Uganda had just emerged from years of major conflict. Relations between women and men had begun to change, and as a result, women started to mobilize for their rights.Over time, it became evident that post-conflict countries had considerably higher rates of female political representation than countries that had not suffered through violence. Post-conflict Liberia was the first African country to elect a woman president. As early as 1994, post-conflict Uganda already had a woman vice president for 10 years. Post-conflict Rwanda today has the highest rate of female legislative representation in the world – 63.8 percent of its legislators are women – and has held that spot since 2003.My latest book, “Women and Power in Postconflict Africa” (Cambridge University Press 2015), shows how the trends I observed in Uganda in the early 1990s became evident in many of the 16 other African countries that came out of conflict, especially after 2000. Across Africa, countries emerging from major conflict were quicker to advance women’s rights and elect women to political office than countries that had remained less conflicted. What is more, post-conflict nations went further in changing their laws and constitutions, offering women more strong legal protections in the areas of land rights, family law, violence and political equality.And it is not just in Africa. We see more women in office after conflict around the world, in such places as Slovenia, Nepal and East Timor.This post-1990s pattern echoes earlier transformations in women’s citizenship, when World War I shook up gender norms across Europe and the United States. Women mobilized for the vote in many countries for decades, but it was only after the war that they finally gained suffrage.The book is based both on extensive fieldwork in Uganda, Liberia and Angola, and on in-depth analysis that compares post-conflict and non-conflict countries across Africa. It also builds on a longitudinal study that I carried out with Melanie Hughes, in which we found statistical evidence of the relationship between women’s legislative representation and the end of major wars that were particularly long or had very high rates of conflict-related deaths.Advancing women’s rights is an unexpected byproduct of warThe Nordic countries took more than 100 years to get equal numbers of women and men in their legislatures. After civil wars, some African countries exceeded their rates almost overnight.None of this, however, happened before the 1990s, a time when women’s rights activists had made gains in legal reform in many African countries and pressured United Nations agencies, foreign donors and international organizations to promote those rights worldwide.Of course, women’s rights activists in post-conflict countries say that the changes have been all too slow and halting. But even the impatience with the the pace of change tells us how much expectations have been transformed. In nondemocratic countries such as Angola, Chad and Eritrea, we see fewer changes, in part because citizens have few political rights and civil liberties.But looking at the big picture in a country like Uganda, we see new women leaders in business, civil society, academia, religious institutions and a host of institutions in which they had previously been invisible. We also see changes in attitudes toward women and women’s leadership. In some countries the changes were more extensive than others, where sometimes one saw change only along a few dimensions.In Angola, for example, women increased their numbers in the legislature but won fewer legal and constitutional rights. But that is, in part, because Angola is not a democracy, and so women were not able to create organizations independent of the government and other dominant political powers. Creating a women’s rights agenda requires women to build coalitions across parties, ethnicities and other identities and affiliations – which can then make demands of the ruling party.Why did post-conflict countries advance women’s status so quickly? Here is why. During conflicts, women are pushed into new roles in the economy, in their households and communities and even in national politics. While some women also fought, others became active in peace movements, which have often been led by women or involved large numbers of women – and then use the transition to peace as a time to demand equality.In Africa, for instance, women were among those most engaged in behind-the-scenes peacemaking, pressuring militia to lay down their arms, demonstrating for peaceful elections and negotiating the release of kidnapped civilians. Further, women gain credibility after these conflicts, since they have been political outsiders, uninvolved with leading the militias and paramilitaries and not responsible for the violence – making a vote for a woman seen as a break with the disastrously violent status quo.From these positions, women often try to influence peace negotiations to include women’s rights planks into the peace accords. The results include quotas for women on candidate slates; explicit listing of sexual violence as a war crime during transitional justice processes, and requirements to include women at the table where new constitutions are being written. Sometimes international donors and other international actors supported and pressured for these results.Some kinds of conflict produced more advances in women’s rights than others While no one would ever advocate war as a route to advancing women, my research showed that the longer or more deadly the war, the more advances women make. That is, in part, because when society is seriously ruptured by war, it is easier to persuade people to adopt new norms, institutions and include new political actors.Further, after a civil war, women’s rights had a better chance of improving if the conflict ended with peace negotiations rather than a decisive victory for one side, as happened in Angola and Sri Lanka. Women and international non-governmental organizations had less power to add women’s rights to the laws and constitutions if one dominant side simply took power than if they were at the table while peace was negotiated and constitutions were rewritten.Finally, women made more advances after major civil wars or wars of national liberation than after interstate or proxy wars, or after low-level conflict, local rebellions or coups d’état. For instance, consider the ongoing conflict in Somalia. There is not enough stability for leaders to worry about legislative reform – and so we should not expect much legal change with respect to women’s status during conflict.Aili Mari Tripp is a professor of political science and gender and women’s studies at the University of Wisconsin at Madison.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Western European countries have long led the world on gender equality, but the latest annual Gender Gap Report, just issued by the World Economic Forum, shows that the U.S. is making significant gains in an area where it has often lagged the Western world.The annual WEF report grades countries on five metrics to measure the degree of gender equality or inequality: economic participation and opportunity, educational attainment, health and survival, and political empowerment. Countries are scored between 0.0 for most unequal, meaning that women have zero access, or 1.0 for fully equal.The 2012 report ranks the U.S. 22nd in the world. The only non-Western nations that rank higher than the U.S., meaning their societies are more equal for women, are South Africa, Cuba, Lesotho, Nicaragua, and the Philippines. American society has been catching up to its historical leaders, as this chart of WEF gender equality scores across Western Europe since 2006 shows.I haven't included Scandinavian countries in this chart. Their scores are so high that it would make it to difficult to portray the U.S.'s relative gains against the rest of Western Europe. But what's also striking about this is the relatively poor gender equality in two of Western Europe's largest economies and more liberal societies: France and Italy.In the broader European context, the U.S. is in fact a better place for women, judging by the WEF data, than is the majority of the continent. Here's a map of Europe, color-coded by gender equality. The blue countries are, according to the WEF data, more accessible societies for women than is the United States, with darker blue signifying better scores. The red countries are less friendly societies for women, with darker red signifying worse scores.This map tells a few different stories. The first is the striking degrees of inequality that remain in Western Europe. In the cases of Spain and France, that has worsened considerably over recent years. The second is the remarkable successes that women have found in Scandinavian countries, by far the most equal for women in the world. And perhaps the third would be the deep problems of gender inequality that persist in much of the former Soviet Union. I'll be looking more into several of these issues throughout the day, so check back.</td>\n",

       "      <td>On election night in November, many cheered a relative milestone: For the first time ever, there would be more than 100 women in the U.S. Congress. Yet while that may be a record high, it doesn't look as impressive when compared with other high-income nations — or even many lower-income ones.The Pew Research Center released a data analysis Monday of a 2014 World Economic Forum report on the gender gap. The analysis examined how the U.S. compares to other countries when it comes to having women in top government posts, and the results aren't reassuring.Among 49 \"high income\" countries, the United States ranks 33rd when it comes to women in legislative roles. Sweden was first. Meanwhile, among a larger group of 137 countries, it came in 83rd. Pew notes that the WEF data is from May 2014, but that even if numbers from the current Congress were analyzed, the United States would still come in just 75th.America did better in other categories, but still fell behind many of its peers. Among high-income countries, it tied with Canada for 12th place on the share of Cabinet-level positions held by women. Among all countries, it was 25th. In this case, however, Pew found that the ratio of U.S. Cabinet positions held by women has actually gone down since the WEF's report, which presumably would mean the U.S. ranking could be even lower.One category in which the United States fared better was that of \"legislators, senior officials and managers.\" It tied for fourth place among high-income countries — with Barbados and Trinidad and Tobago — in this ranking that measures women's representation across multiple leadership positions including corporate managers, legislators, top political party officials and nonprofit leaders. (When the larger group of countries was analyzed, it was tied for 16th with Namibia.)What's holding women back in the United States? Pew addressed that question as part of its Women and Leadership survey, the first in a series of reports about the topic, of which this analysis is a part. In the survey, 38 percent of respondents said more women did not reach higher political office because they are held to higher standards, while 37 percent thought it was because others weren't ready to elect them. Just 17 percent attributed the low numbers to women's family responsibilities, and 27 percent to a lack of support from political parties.Read also:More than 100 women in Congress for the first time—and not much growthBecky Hammon's path to the NBALike On Leadership?

       "      <td>It's still months until September, when Britain's next prime minister will be named, and November, when the United States will elect its next president. But the political turmoil that's erupted following Britain's vote to leave the European Union has put in place the possibility of a profoundly historic moment: By next January, women could lead the three largest Western economies.Yes, it's early, and yes, it's still totally speculative. But the possibility that women could lead the United States, Britain and Germany at the same time is also a very real one. Angela Merkel's term as chancellor of Germany is not up until the fall of 2017, when the country will hold its next election. Hillary Clinton is poised to become the first female nominee of a major U.S. political party, and she is currently leading in many polls against Donald Trump, the presumptive GOP nominee.And with the decision by former London Mayor Boris Johnson not to run to be the Conservative Party's next leader -- who will replace David Cameron in September as Britain's prime minister -- Home Secretary Theresa May has vaulted into the lead as the favorite among British oddsmakers. Meanwhile, a YouGov/Times poll also put her in the lead, though it did not include Michael Gove, the justice secretary who had repeatedly said he didn't want the job but shocked Britain Thursday with the announcement that he did.\"This is not crazy stuff -- it's a moment to take note of,\" said Debbie Walsh, director of the Center for American Women in Politics at Rutgers University. \"Even the fact, honestly, that two women are among the two leading candidates [in the U.S. and Britain] -- that it could even possibly happen -- is in and of itself historic. It’s really extraordinary. There’s never been anything like that before, where it was even in the realm of possibility, let alone happen.\" Britain, of course, has had a female prime minister before: Margaret Thatcher served from 1979 to 1990. Merkel is Germany's first female chancellor, a position she has held since 2005. The United States, meanwhile, has never had a female nominee from a major political party.May voted to remain in the European Union, though she is noted to have done so \"gently,\" keeping a low profile and still finding fans among \"Euroskeptics\" for her immigration policies. That position could make her less attractive as the person to negotiate Britain's exit -- or it could make her be seen as more of a unifier, a role she is casting herself in. \"That's nice middle ground at a moment when Great Britain is quite at odds with itself about this decision,\" Walsh said.Then there is also Marine Le Pen, who leads the far right National Front party in France. The next French presidential election will be in the spring of 2017, which the Post's Michael Birnbaum writes \"appears ripe for an insurgent candidate such as Le Pen,\" particularly after the recent Brexit vote. He reports that while she leads many polls for France's crowded first round of voting, she falls behind Hollande in the second, head-to-head vote.If in fact there do end up being two, or three, or even more women around the table at the next G-8 Summit, Walsh says that image could radically reshuffle how we view the opportunity for getting women into global leadership roles. \"It could disrupt our image of who world leaders can be,\" she said, \"and would do so at a very, very high level.\"Read also:A Hillary Clinton-Elizabeth Warren pairing would be profoundly unusual — and not just in national politicsThe startling leadership vacuum in post-Brexit BritainLike On Leadership?

       "      <td>Although some analysts have criticized the focus of Western governments and NGOs on goals such as trying to increase the number of women in parliaments, enhancing women’s representation remains a central objective of many international democracy promotion efforts in the Arab world. But the impacts of these efforts are more complex than they might appear. Lila Abu Lughod’s provocative recent book, “Do Muslim Women Need Saving?” challenges what she refers to as a Western “moral crusade to rescue oppressed Muslim women from their cultures and their religion [that] has swept the public sphere.” She notes that international, and especially U.S., pressure on Muslim governments to improve on certain measures of gender equality could actually undermine the local legitimacy of feminist causes.Is she right? In “Anti-Americanism, Authoritarian Politics, and Attitudes about Women’s Representation: Evidence from a Survey Experiment in Jordan,” an article published by International Studies Quarterly in July, we report on a unique experimental study that examines how U.S. and domestic endorsements of women in politics affect local attitudes about women’s representation in Jordan.We focus on Jordan for several reasons. First, the international community – including the United States – has strongly pressured Jordan to improve women’s representation, including through the adoption of measures such as gender quotas for its elected national parliament and local councils. Although Jordan is a monarchy that is strongly allied with the United States and European countries, it has been subject to the same international democracy promotion efforts pushing for the adoption of gender quotas that have occurred globally. Second, anti-American attitudes are widespread in Jordan, which heightens the possibility that foreign support for women’s representation could engender a local backlash.Our study draws on evidence from a nationally representative survey of the political attitudes of 1,650 adults in Jordan in November 2010. The survey contained a randomized experiment that was designed to help us understand the effects of foreign support for gender equality on local attitudes. The experiment contained three conditions. We first told a group of randomly selected respondents about Jordan’s quota and the support of a U.S. government-funded organization for women’s political participation in Jordan. Then, as a point of comparison, we told a group of randomly selected respondents about Jordan’s quota and the support of some Jordanian imams for women’s political participation. Finally, a control group received only information about Jordan’s quota. After obtaining their experimental treatments, all respondents were asked questions about their support for women’s representation, including women running for parliament and serving as municipal councilors.Our findings about the effects of the endorsements were surprising. Although few respondents expressed trust in the United States, providing them with information about a U.S. organization’s support for Jordan’s gender quota did not depress their support for women’s representation on average when compared to the control group. For example, 64 percent of respondents in the control condition expressed willingness to vote for a woman running for parliament, whereas 66 percent of respondents in the U.S. treatment did so – a small increase that was not statistically significant. Our analysis suggests that this null finding is not driven by respondents’ preexisting beliefs about the endorsers’ support for gender equality, their preexisting trust in the endorsers, or their levels of political knowledge.Moreover, although most respondents expressed trust in local imams, we found that providing them with information about these religious leaders’ support for Jordan’s gender quota did not increase their support for this issue on average. Both local and international reformers often seek out endorsements from trusted religious leaders for their policy goals. It is not clear, however, from this evidence that such strategies will always pay off. For example, an identical 64 percent of respondents in the control and religious endorsement conditions expressed willingness to vote for a woman running for parliament.Finally, our study uncovered some preliminary evidence that both U.S. and religious endorsements reduce support for women’s representation more among women who opposed the monarchy than supported it. That finding holds even though regime opponents and supporters have similar attitudes about gender. To interpret those unexpected findings, we argue that, in autocracies, disposition toward the incumbent regime is an important cleavage that shapes citizens’ receptivity to endorsements. This interpretation dovetails with research by Dan Corstange and Nikolay Marinov that shows how foreign endorsements polarized domestic attitudes in Lebanon.These findings challenge much of the conventional wisdom about international democracy promotion in the Middle East. Some observers after the Arab Spring urged the United States and other foreign actors not to undermine the legitimacy of local reformers’ efforts. According to Al Jazeera’s former director general, Wadah Khanfar, for example, “what is most important about the Arab spring is that it is coming from Arabs themselves.” At least in the case of gender quotas in Jordan, however, the results suggest that foreign endorsements of political reforms will not necessarily delegitimize the cause, even when delivered by American groups that publics might generally distrust. As we note in the article: “If American support has no average negative impact on public attitudes toward women in politics, the net effect of active American efforts to promote women’s representation is more likely to be beneficial.”Sarah Bush is an assistant professor of political science at Temple University and a senior fellow with the Project on Democratic Transitions at the Foreign Policy Research Institute.

       "      <td>CAIRO — After Egyptian women stood shoulder to shoulder with men in the protests that toppled Hosni Mubarak, many looked forward to a role in the revolution’s next steps. But 15 months later, as Egyptians prepare to vote for a new president this week, rights activists complain that women are being excluded from key decisions.“At the time of the revolution, women were needed to fill out the numbers,” said Hoda Badran, head of the Egyptian Feminist Union, which was banned under Mubarak but reinstated last year. “Now, the decision-makers don’t need women, and we’re back to this idea that femininity is inferior and masculinity superior.”Women hold just over 2 percent of the seats in Egypt’s new parliament, down from about 12 percent in the last elections held under Mubarak. The sharp decline followed the elimination of a quota to ensure women’s representation, which had been seen by many as a way to stack the body with members of Mubarak’s political party.Military rulers did not include any women in the committee that wrote constitutional amendments adopted in a nationwide referendum last year. And there are no women among the 13 candidates who will be on the ballot Wednesday, when voting begins in the country’s first post-Mubarak presidential election.Badran and other women’s rights activists are particularly worried that the well-organized Muslim Brotherhood will use its religious and charitable groups to encourage uneducated and poor women to vote for its candidate, Mohammed Morsi. Morsi opposes women being allowed to serve in the presidency. He has called for the implementation of Islamic law and, at campaign rallies, referred to Islam’s holy book, the Koran, as the constitution.To counter the Brotherhood, Badran’s group has hired hundreds of buses to take women to the polls. It is also distributing pamphlets that encourage women to vote for a candidate who respects women, who doesn’t use religion to campaign and who doesn’t lie, Badran said. The group has not endorsed a candidate.Among its Arab neighbors, Egypt boasts some of the strongest legal protections for women. Women here can sue for divorce. They are a significant part of the workforce, and they are not subject to an Islamic dress code. Egyptian women who are married to foreign men can pass on citizenship to their children, unlike in more socially liberal countries such as Lebanon, where they cannot.But the Islamist-dominated parliament is discussing several proposals that could change women’s status here. They include lowering the legal age of marriage for girls from 18 to 13 and revoking divorced mothers’ custody of their boys at age 7 and girls at 9, rather than at 15, a move that would be in accordance with a strict interpretation of Islamic law.The existing rules were projects of Suzanne Mubarak, the former first lady, a strong advocate of laws to protect women and children’s rights. But she was also accused of monopolizing the issue and putting laws on the books that were never implemented, while independent women’s groups were not allowed to flourish.Of all of Egypt’s political blocs the Muslim Brotherhood’s Freedom and Justice Party has the most female lawmakers in parliament, though many women’s rights activists see them as part of a religious organization that traditionally has not allowed women full-fledged membership.Azza el-Garf, a mother of seven and a member of parliament, has come under intense criticism from liberals and women’s right groups for advocating the revisiting of hard-won laws that women had thought were irreversible, such as the right for women to divorce their husbands and the age of marriage.“When creating laws that concern the families, they need to be in line with Islamic law,” Garf said. But she insisted that the nine women elected to Egypt’s new parliament “gave a big push for the image of women in politics.” (Two other women were appointed to parliament, bringing the total to 11.)At a weekend conference in Cairo, presidential hopefuls were invited to speak to thousands of female voters about their agendas and how they related to women’s rights. Only five candidates attended, with most of the leading candidates absent.Ashraf Rasheed, a representative of Amr Moussa, the former Arab League chief and the liberal front-runner, said that if Moussa wins, he will appoint a female vice president. The audience burst into applause, though Rasheed was then asked to explain why Moussa himself had not attended.Ghada Kamal, a young activist who said she was severely beaten and detained by military police during clashes outside the cabinet building this past winter, is more concerned about the loss of the revolution’s focus on dismantling Mubarak’s regime than about women’s rights. And she’s not sure whether she will vote.“The Egyptian woman discovered she is strong, not weak or oppressed as she had imagined, and that she has a very important role to play, just like a man,” Kamal said. “I don’t think anything has changed for women or men in terms of human or social rights. If this had happened, we would have said that the revolution succeeded.”</td>\n",

       "      <td>The news that Canada’s Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has named a gender-balanced cabinet — and one that is more representative along other dimensions, including religion and ability — is refreshing. (The cabinet of his predecessor, Steven Harper, included six women among its 26 members in 2006).Even more encouraging than Trudeau’s leadership on this issue — and his lack of excuses — is his apparent understanding of the need to address inequality. When asked why he named a government comprised of 50 percent women, he said simply, “Because it’s 2015.” As succinct as his response was, it reflects much greater clarity about the problem of inequality — and its solution — than much public discussion on the issue.Scholars who study politics and gender reject conventional wisdom that women’s marginalization from leadership is due to poorer performance or lesser qualifications (women now outnumber men in advanced degrees in the United States, as in conservative Islamic countries), arguing instead that it reflects unfair recruitment practices. In addition to gender-based biases, inequality can also arise from basic social practices, including the tendency to socialize with others of the same gender. Men simply know fewer women and often prefer to work with other males. This observation helps expose the fallacy that gender equality will be easily achieved without institutional solutions like quotas.Unfortunately, debates about gender have also figured prominently in the U.S. presidential primary races, and in troubling ways. Despite the presence of female candidates Hillary Clinton and Carly Fiorina, public debate on and media coverage of the issue are often devoid of an understanding of the mechanisms that create and perpetuate inequality.In a recent article in Governance — currently ungated — I write about issues of women’s access to government resources and the role that often overlooked structural factors play in contributing to this problem. Although my research takes place in two authoritarian countries in North Africa, it highlights why subtle social dynamics can perpetuate women and other minorities’ lack of access to political power, even when social stereotypes and sexism are diminishing in society in general.Drawing on an original survey of 200 Moroccan and Algerian parliamentarians and field research conducted 2006-2007, I investigate the link between parliamentarian gender, quotas, and service provision to women. A form of constituency service, parliamentary clientelism refers to providing help with personal and community problems, including medical services, judicial or bureaucratic corruption, jobs, money or grants, or electricity. Due to high levels of corruption and economic difficulties in many non-democratic settings, elected officials often spend much of their time trying to help citizens with these issues. Yet I find that women are relatively excluded from these informal service networks with parliamentarians, due in part to structural factors. On average, 20-29 percent of requests that Moroccan and Algerian parliamentarians receive are from women. The effects of gender quotas are striking. While electing women increases service responsiveness to females, parliamentarians elected through quotas experience mandates to help women and are more responsive to females than members of either sex elected without quotas.To explain gender gaps in clientelistic services — and to think about why progress toward gender parity in United States and many other relatively egalitarian societies has stalled — I extend Elin Bjarnegård’s (2013) theory of homosocial capital, which she developed to explain male dominance in Thai parliamentary politics. Homosociality refers to friendships, collaborations and other non-romantic relationships with others of the same gender. Bjarnegård argues that, as long as males are numerically dominant in positions of power, they will continue to enjoy advantages accumulating homosocial capital — predictable relationships with individuals who are similar and have resources needed to win elections.According to Bjarnegård, homosocial capital is composed of instrumental and expressive resources. Expressive resources are dispositional similarities which facilitate close, predictable relationships and access to instrumental resources needed to succeed in campaigns.Men and women often prefer friendship and work collaboration with others of the same gender, due to greater ease relating (e.g., similar behavior and interests, fewer conflicts and sexual harassment concerns, higher trust). Male dominance is reproduced because instrumental and expressive resources are seldom in opposition for men. Males have more instrumental resources and can rely on homosocial linkages. In contrast, women must foster heterosocial networks to obtain resources, while enjoying less expressive resources, such as trust and familiarity, in networks with men.I extend Bjarnegård’s theory of homosocial capital accumulation by incorporating structural and normative aspects of patriarchy into the framework and identifying two gender gaps: in parliamentarians’ supply of and citizens’ demand for services. Patriarchal structures are formal laws and policies such as personal status (e.g., marriage, divorce, inheritance, mobility) and employment laws (e.g., wage discrimination, sex segregation) which give males more instrumental resources and reproduce stereotypes about women’s traits and abilities (i.e., what women are like and can do), including their ability to provide wasta (use of a connection to gets things one needs). Patriarchal norms and attitudes are traditional views of gender roles which identify public space as male, discourage mixing of unrelated males and females, and justify gender discrimination (i.e., what women should do).Exclusion of women from service provision occurs through mutually-reinforcing structural and dispositional factors operating on the supply and demand-side of exchanges. On the instrumental, supply-side, patriarchal structures limit female deputies’ instrumental resources needed to provide services. Because female leaders enjoy fewer patronage networks, women are less likely to be seen as good wastas and are less able to run and succeed in elections (see Table 1).In Tunisia, 19.1 percent saw male deputies as better service providers, compared to 6.9 percent who saw women as better (73.9 percent believed there was no difference), according to a 2014 Transitional Governance Project survey of 1200 Tunisians conducted by United Nations Democracy Fund and Centre d’Études Maghrébines à Tunis, in collaboration with Lindsay Benstead, Ellen Lust, Dhafer Malouche and JMW Consulting.In Jordan, 45.4 percent saw males as better, compared to 13.5 percent females (41.1 percent, no difference), according to a 2014 Program on Governance and Local Development poll conducted among 1,488 Jordanians by Lindsay Benstead, Kristen Kao and Ellen Lust.In Libya, 28.2 percent believed a man would be more effective, compared to 10.9 percent women (60.9 percent, no difference), according to a 2013 National Democratic Institute poll of 1200 Libyans conducted by Diwan Research and the Transitional Governance Project, in collaboration with Lindsay Benstead, Ellen Lust, and JMW Consulting.Table 1. Mechanisms of exclusion from service provisionOn the instrumental, demand side, patriarchal structures exclude women from public space (e.g., employment, politics), giving them fewer resources and influence. Women are less likely to be civically engaged or lead civil society groups, Sufi brotherhoods, and tribes — groups which are critical for winning semi-competitive elections.The Transitional Governance Project found voting in first post-uprisings parliamentary elections was 77 percent for Egyptian men, 58 percent for women; 75 percent for Tunisian men, 65 percent for women; and, 84 percent for Libyan men, 59 percent for women.

       "      <td>So the U.K. has its second female prime minister. What policies put more women in power?</td>\n",
       "      <td>In becoming Britain’s second female prime minister, Theresa May has made the country just the sixth in Europe (and 17th in the world) to have had more than one female leader.May, like her female predecessor Margaret Thatcher, is a Conservative. Her party’s main rival, the Labour Party, has had a parade of white male leaders. Although Margaret Beckett and Harriet Harman served as interim Labour Party leaders, neither was elected to that post.Which party has better female representation: Conservative or Labour?So is the Conservative Party beating Labour 2 to 0 in representing women in politics, as former prime minister David Cameron quipped in his final Prime Minister’s Questions? Is it true that the Conservative Party, as Boris Johnson said last week, is “the most progressive party in Britain” when it comes to representing women? No, in at least two important ways.First, on the benches of the House of Commons, only 21 percent of Conservative Party MPs are women — less than half that of the Labour Party, whose MPS are now 43 percent women. In fact, for almost two decades, Labour has consistently had about twice the proportion of women as has the Conservative Party, as the graph below shows.Second, unlike the Conservatives, Labour has consistently used robust policies in selecting candidates to guarantee healthy female representation on their slate.Here’s how Britain’s Labour Party boosted female representation in Parliament More than 100 political parties around the world — including Labour — use what are called “gender quota.” Labour’s gender quota policy, called all-women shortlists, was first used for the 1997 election. It commits the party to considering only female candidates in at least half of all “winnable” seats that come open.The policy’s results were dramatic. That year, the proportion of women in the Parliamentary Labour Party went from 14 percent to 24 percent, and the number of women in parliament overall doubled from 60 to 120. Labour has continued to use all-women shortlists in selecting its candidates for general elections ever since, with one exception. During the 2001 election, a legal challenge made the practice illegal. But a Labour-dominated Parliament amended the Equality Act to accommodate the provision.Here’s how the British Conservative Party tried to boost female representation in Parliament By contrast, the Conservative Party’s attempts to increase the number of female MPs have been significantly less effective. From the mid-2000s, Conservative gender-equality activists pressured party leaders to pay more attention to the underrepresentation of women. May, now prime minister, co-founded one key effort: Women2win, an organization to encourage and support women entering into Conservative Party politics. As Sarah Childs, Paul Webb and Sally Marthaler argued in the journal Political Quarterly, these efforts were important in changing party attitudes.In fact, after being selected party leader in 2005, David Cameron spent much of his acceptance speech promising that the party will “change the scandalous under-representation of women in the Conservative Party.” Within the year, the party introduced what it called priority candidate list — or the “A-List,” of about 150 aspiring candidates, from which local party organizers were encouraged to select. The party promised that the A-List would be at least 50 percent women and that a “significant” proportion would be nonwhite, and also introduced rules for gender-balanced shortlisting during the candidate-selection process.In Political Quarterly, Rosie Campbell, Joni Lovenduski and Childs argued that Cameron’s increased emphasis on getting more women into Parliament was an important evolution of the Conservative Party, raising awareness within the party of the need to “modernize” and appeal to female voters. But relatively few local party constituencies (equivalent to, in the United States, a district party organization) selected women from the A-List, and it was abandoned altogether in 2012. While Conservative Party leaders encouraged them to voluntarily select all-female shortlists themselves, no local party chose to do so. Although more Conservative women were elected in 2010, they still made up only a modest 16 percent of Conservative MPs, a bit more than half of Labour’s 31 percent.So what kinds of policies actually lead to gender equality in politics? Lovenduski in her book “Feminizing Politics” puts attempts to tackle women’s political underrepresentation into three categories: equality rhetoric, equality promotion and equality guarantees. While the Conservative Party in the past decade has had plenty of equality rhetoric and promotion — which Lovenduski considers important steps toward “feminizing politics” — it has stopped short of guaranteeing equality. Labour, by contrast, took steps to guarantee equal representation. Political scientists, such as Mona Lena Krook, have consistently found that robust equality guarantees in the form of gender quotas are the surest route to increasing women’s representation at all levels in politics. The results can be counted.Of course, only the Conservative Party has put women into the top spotIt’s true that the Conservative Party has now put women in the most exceptional position in Britain: that of prime minister. But it has not gone far in diversifying its gender composition. As Diana O’Brien and Karen Beckwith wrote here earlier this week, both Thatcher and May came to power after political crises, which is often the way women become political leaders. That might soon happen in the Labour Party as well; if Angela Eagle succeeds in challenging Jeremy Corbyn for leader, she too may take over at a time of organizational disaster.In other words, even women’s rise to the top of the party may not indicate a commitment to institutional change; rather, it’s a product of political convenience and circumstance.Nugent is a PhD candidate at Rutgers University at New Brunswick, studying women and politics.

       "      <td>Ecuador votes on Sunday. These are 5 things you need to know.</td>\n",
       "      <td>On Sunday, Ecuadorians head to the polls to elect legislators as well as a replacement for the thrice-elected President Rafael Correa, the longest-serving chief executive in the country’s history. Along with policy changes, the country may see some shifts in the proportion of female legislators.Here’s what you need to know about Ecuador’s presidential and legislative elections, where voting is mandatory:1) There are 8 presidential candidates The last official survey results, released Feb. 8 before a government-imposed media blackout, showed a tight race. Front-runners are the ruling Alianza PAIS (AP) candidate, Lenín Moreno, who served as vice president from 2007 to 2013; and the Creando Oportunidades (CREO) movement’s Guillermo Lasso, a conservative former economy minister and banker who was a distant presidential runner-up in 2013.The Feb. 8 survey of decided and undecided voters gave Moreno 32 percent of likely votes versus 21 percent for Lasso, and 14 percent for former congresswoman Cynthia Viteri. The center-left ex-mayor of Quito, Paco Moncayo, has just 8 percent support, and the four other candidates representing minor parties are polling at 4 percent or less for each. Nearly 12 percent of respondents would cast a null vote to reject the field.However, a whopping 35 percent of these voters are undecided, meaning more than a third of Ecuadorians are not wedded to a single candidate, adding a high degree of uncertainty to Sunday’s proceedings. 2) This is what Ecuador’s electoral system looks likeEcuador uses a two-round voting system for its presidential election. To win outright and avoid a runoff election, presidential candidates need to get 40 percent of the vote and hold at least a 10 percent advantage over the nearest rival in the first round. The poll numbers suggest no candidate will win outright, however.It seems likely that Moreno will end up in an April 2 runoff with Lasso or Viteri. Given political polarization in the country, the opposition hopes that anti-government sentiment will push voters to coalesce around a single candidate.Ecuadorians will also cast National Assembly votes this Sunday, using the rare free list electoral system, which is somewhat like an extreme version of open lists. Some countries elect their parliaments or congresses using an open list, which lets voters choose among candidates on the list. Others use a closed electoral list, where voters vote for the party itself, rather than individual candidates.Ecuador’s system, however, allows voters to choose individuals not only within party lists, but among different parties as well. In other words, voters may choose an entire slate of candidates from their party — as in a closed-list system — or cast individual nominal votes among the candidates.3) How have rules and voter behavior boosted representation by women? In 2015, Ecuador boasted the third-highest percentage of female legislators in Latin America (53 of 137 assembly members, or 39 percent of its unicameral legislature), behind only Bolivia (53 percent) and Nicaragua (40 percent). Just 25 years earlier, women failed to exceed even 7 percent of Ecuador’s legislature.Many of these great strides reflect Ecuador’s legislative efforts on gender representation. In 1997, lawmakers introduced a 20 percent quota on party lists, which would increase by 5 percent for each election cycle until parity was achieved.This law was replaced by Articles 99(1) and 160 of the 2009 Electoral Law, which establish a 50 percent quota — parity — and the alternation of male and female candidates on proportional representation candidate lists, known as the “zipper method.” This means if a party won four seats in a district, for instance, it would be represented in Congress by two male and two female legislators. 4) How might the unusual voting system affect women’s representation in 2017?In a working project, Tom Mustillo of Purdue University and I found that, buoyed by Correa’s strong presidential coattails and high public approval, AP voters tend to use the party-list option under the free list. But opposition voters tend to cast individual votes across party lines.The effects on women’s representation are noticeable. Of the 53 female legislators elected in 2013, 46 were Alianza PAIS candidates, and only 7 came from other parties. In fact, as Figure 1 shows, 46 percent of AP legislators were women, compared with just 19 percent of opposition legislators.AP voters may be more enlightened with regard to gender than are voters at large. But it’s likely that the way voters use the free-list system affects the effectiveness of laws enacted to create gender quotas. Without Correa at the helm of AP, will voters shy away from party lists? If so, the percentage of female legislators will most certainly fall in 2017.5) What is Ecuador’s ‘muerte cruzada,’ and how might this affect stability?Correa boasted a majority government for a large chunk of his presidency, the first president to do so since Ecuador’s return to democracy in 1979. Dogged by corruption allegations surrounding the government, AP isn’t likely to earn a majority in the next National Assembly. With their weak organization and national penetration, the opposition parties are even less likely to do so.This matters a great deal to Ecuador’s political stability. Under a weaker government, the muerte cruzada (“mutual death”) provision in Article 148 of the 2008 constitution gives the president the option to dissolve the National Assembly — and simultaneously cut short his own term. The government would then call for new legislative and presidential elections, with the incumbent allowed to govern by decree on urgent economic matters in the interim.Muerte cruzada was never a legitimate threat in the latter years of Correa’s presidency. However, this constitutional feature dramatically increases the risks that a divided or minority government might end in deadlock and dissolution.This could lead to frequent elections and changes of government, as in the decade from 1996 to 2006, when no elected Ecuadorian president served out a full term. It could also increase the temptation for presidents to dissolve parliament so that they can govern unilaterally during the undefined interim period before new elections can be held.Rafael Correa has dominated Ecuador’s politics since 2007 through good politicking, populist policymaking and closing channels of dissent, as well as a political context he helped shape with a new constitution. While Ecuador has made great strides in women’s representation and enjoyed a decade of political stability, Sunday’s election may mark a step backward.

       "      <td>The news that Canada’s Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has named a gender-balanced cabinet — and one that is more representative along other dimensions, including religion and ability — is refreshing. (The cabinet of his predecessor, Steven Harper, included six women among its 26 members in 2006).Even more encouraging than Trudeau’s leadership on this issue — and his lack of excuses — is his apparent understanding of the need to address inequality. When asked why he named a government comprised of 50 percent women, he said simply, “Because it’s 2015.” As succinct as his response was, it reflects much greater clarity about the problem of inequality — and its solution — than much public discussion on the issue.Scholars who study politics and gender reject conventional wisdom that women’s marginalization from leadership is due to poorer performance or lesser qualifications (women now outnumber men in advanced degrees in the United States, as in conservative Islamic countries), arguing instead that it reflects unfair recruitment practices. In addition to gender-based biases, inequality can also arise from basic social practices, including the tendency to socialize with others of the same gender. Men simply know fewer women and often prefer to work with other males. This observation helps expose the fallacy that gender equality will be easily achieved without institutional solutions like quotas.Unfortunately, debates about gender have also figured prominently in the U.S. presidential primary races, and in troubling ways. Despite the presence of female candidates Hillary Clinton and Carly Fiorina, public debate on and media coverage of the issue are often devoid of an understanding of the mechanisms that create and perpetuate inequality.In a recent article in Governance — currently ungated — I write about issues of women’s access to government resources and the role that often overlooked structural factors play in contributing to this problem. Although my research takes place in two authoritarian countries in North Africa, it highlights why subtle social dynamics can perpetuate women and other minorities’ lack of access to political power, even when social stereotypes and sexism are diminishing in society in general.Drawing on an original survey of 200 Moroccan and Algerian parliamentarians and field research conducted 2006-2007, I investigate the link between parliamentarian gender, quotas, and service provision to women. A form of constituency service, parliamentary clientelism refers to providing help with personal and community problems, including medical services, judicial or bureaucratic corruption, jobs, money or grants, or electricity. Due to high levels of corruption and economic difficulties in many non-democratic settings, elected officials often spend much of their time trying to help citizens with these issues. Yet I find that women are relatively excluded from these informal service networks with parliamentarians, due in part to structural factors. On average, 20-29 percent of requests that Moroccan and Algerian parliamentarians receive are from women. The effects of gender quotas are striking. While electing women increases service responsiveness to females, parliamentarians elected through quotas experience mandates to help women and are more responsive to females than members of either sex elected without quotas.To explain gender gaps in clientelistic services — and to think about why progress toward gender parity in United States and many other relatively egalitarian societies has stalled — I extend Elin Bjarnegård’s (2013) theory of homosocial capital, which she developed to explain male dominance in Thai parliamentary politics. Homosociality refers to friendships, collaborations and other non-romantic relationships with others of the same gender. Bjarnegård argues that, as long as males are numerically dominant in positions of power, they will continue to enjoy advantages accumulating homosocial capital — predictable relationships with individuals who are similar and have resources needed to win elections.According to Bjarnegård, homosocial capital is composed of instrumental and expressive resources. Expressive resources are dispositional similarities which facilitate close, predictable relationships and access to instrumental resources needed to succeed in campaigns.Men and women often prefer friendship and work collaboration with others of the same gender, due to greater ease relating (e.g., similar behavior and interests, fewer conflicts and sexual harassment concerns, higher trust). Male dominance is reproduced because instrumental and expressive resources are seldom in opposition for men. Males have more instrumental resources and can rely on homosocial linkages. In contrast, women must foster heterosocial networks to obtain resources, while enjoying less expressive resources, such as trust and familiarity, in networks with men.I extend Bjarnegård’s theory of homosocial capital accumulation by incorporating structural and normative aspects of patriarchy into the framework and identifying two gender gaps: in parliamentarians’ supply of and citizens’ demand for services. Patriarchal structures are formal laws and policies such as personal status (e.g., marriage, divorce, inheritance, mobility) and employment laws (e.g., wage discrimination, sex segregation) which give males more instrumental resources and reproduce stereotypes about women’s traits and abilities (i.e., what women are like and can do), including their ability to provide wasta (use of a connection to gets things one needs). Patriarchal norms and attitudes are traditional views of gender roles which identify public space as male, discourage mixing of unrelated males and females, and justify gender discrimination (i.e., what women should do).Exclusion of women from service provision occurs through mutually-reinforcing structural and dispositional factors operating on the supply and demand-side of exchanges. On the instrumental, supply-side, patriarchal structures limit female deputies’ instrumental resources needed to provide services. Because female leaders enjoy fewer patronage networks, women are less likely to be seen as good wastas and are less able to run and succeed in elections (see Table 1).In Tunisia, 19.1 percent saw male deputies as better service providers, compared to 6.9 percent who saw women as better (73.9 percent believed there was no difference), according to a 2014 Transitional Governance Project survey of 1200 Tunisians conducted by United Nations Democracy Fund and Centre d’Études Maghrébines à Tunis, in collaboration with Lindsay Benstead, Ellen Lust, Dhafer Malouche and JMW Consulting.In Jordan, 45.4 percent saw males as better, compared to 13.5 percent females (41.1 percent, no difference), according to a 2014 Program on Governance and Local Development poll conducted among 1,488 Jordanians by Lindsay Benstead, Kristen Kao and Ellen Lust.In Libya, 28.2 percent believed a man would be more effective, compared to 10.9 percent women (60.9 percent, no difference), according to a 2013 National Democratic Institute poll of 1200 Libyans conducted by Diwan Research and the Transitional Governance Project, in collaboration with Lindsay Benstead, Ellen Lust, and JMW Consulting.Table 1. Mechanisms of exclusion from service provisionOn the instrumental, demand side, patriarchal structures exclude women from public space (e.g., employment, politics), giving them fewer resources and influence. Women are less likely to be civically engaged or lead civil society groups, Sufi brotherhoods, and tribes — groups which are critical for winning semi-competitive elections.The Transitional Governance Project found voting in first post-uprisings parliamentary elections was 77 percent for Egyptian men, 58 percent for women; 75 percent for Tunisian men, 65 percent for women; and, 84 percent for Libyan men, 59 percent for women.

       "      <td>Kim Yi Dionne: This post is the second in a three-part series on gender and politics focused on political leadership. The series highlights recent political science scholarship that examines experiences from around the world. An earlier post by Farida Jalalzai discussed global trends of women achieving executive office and a forthcoming post by Jana Morgan will discuss women’s leadership in Latin America. Today’s post is a contribution from Leonardo Arriola, Associate Professor of Political Science at UC Berkeley and Martha Johnson, Assistant Professor of Political Science at Mills College. Arriola and Johnson share insights from their recently published article in the American Journal of Political Science: “Ethnic Politics and Women’s Empowerment in Africa: Ministerial Appointments to Executive Cabinets.”****Women in African countries have considerably expanded their participation in political power over the past three decades. Current presidents like Joyce Banda of Malawi, Ellen Johnson Sirleaf of Liberia, and Catherine Samba-Panza of Central African Republic offer visible proof of women’s increasing presence in African executive authority. The emergence of these women leaders reflects a broader regional trend. Since 1980, the proportion of women appointed as cabinet ministers in African countries has increased from 4 percent to 20 percent, placing the region second in the world just behind the Americas and ahead of Europe. Whereas only one-third of African countries had a woman cabinet minister in 1980, today women are included in the cabinet of every African country. But the growth of women in African governance has not necessarily translated into real influence. Previous scholarship has shown that women around the world typically receive appointments to less prestigious, more “feminine,” ministerial portfolios like women’s affairs, which are rarely launching pads for greater authority. This remains true in much of Africa. Based on data from 43 African countries between 1980 and 2005, we find that women are significantly less likely than men to receive high prestige appointments in areas such as finance or defense. Women are more likely to be found in medium prestige portfolios like education, which may have sizable personnel and resources but little influence, or low prestige portfolios like culture with small budgets and narrow constituencies.Prevailing cabinet appointment patterns among African governments have tended to limit the influence of women in high politics. Women are more likely than men to get stuck in less prestigious cabinet positions. As Figure 1 illustrates, men and women have contrasting tenure patterns: men spend more time in more powerful positions whereas women spend more time in less powerful positions. This is problematic because appointments to low prestige portfolios are cabinet dead-ends for most politicians, since they are typically shuffled out of the government without being elevated to more powerful positions. This is especially true for women: while 12.06 percent of men who start in low or medium prestige portfolios are promoted to high prestige portfolios, only 5.74 percent of women have experienced similar promotions.Despite their growing numbers in African governments, women continue to have limited policy influence because they tend to be concentrated in a single area of government. Figure 2 shows the functional classification of 9,824 portfolio appointments held by men and women across 43 African countries between 1980 and 2005. Whereas men tend to be broadly distributed across functional areas, more than half of all women (53.95 percent) are appointed to portfolios that concern government’s social welfare functions in areas like education, family affairs, community development, and culture. Only one-fifth of men (20.82 percent) are appointed to such portfolios. These proportions nearly flip among portfolios that oversee economic functions such as agriculture, lands, and public works with only 22.87 percent of women receiving such appointments versus 43.09 percent of men. Why do women continue to be appointed to less influential positions in African governments? Previous studies of government formation in advanced democracies suggest that women tend to lose out on powerful portfolios where such appointments are used to forge coalitions among party leaders, who are primarily men. We believe a similar dynamic holds in African countries. Despite the ongoing process of democratization, incumbent presidents use high prestige appointments to win the support of influential politicians who, because of their sizable ethnic or regional constituencies, can potentially pose a threat to the executive’s continued hold on power. Women are rarely in such positions in African countries.African leaders may instead appoint women to their cabinets to signal their intent to deliver on campaign promises. Ongoing democratization has created greater pressure for the region’s governments to deliver on reform and improved governance. Some leaders have responded by appointing women to their cabinets with reputations built through work in activist movements, professional associations, and non-governmental organizations. For example, in Uganda, women’s rights activist Miria Matembe, an outspoken critic of corruption, was appointed to lead the Ministry for Ethics and Integrity. In this respect, the entry of women policy advocates in African governments conforms to a broader cross-national pattern in which women with policy or professional expertise are more likely to be appointed to the cabinet.African women’s executive influence will ultimately depend on the emergence of women who possess both the political capital to negotiate high prestige appointments and exceptional qualifications in related policy areas. Although existing patronage channels connected to state agencies and ruling parties remain dominated by men, growing opportunities in the private sector and international organizations may enable women to acquire expertise and influence in a wide range of policy areas, making them attractive candidates for the highest levels of government. In Nigeria, for example, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, was twice appointed finance minister after having gaining experience as an economist and vice-president working for the World Bank. Her path, like that of Africa’s three women presidents and the other women ministers we have studied, demonstrates that African women are using professional training, career excellence, and outspoken activism to make ever larger cracks in the glass ceilings of executive power. In the process, many women ministers are pushing for a new model of African governance, one that is more professional, transparent, and responsive to women’s needs and concerns.</td>\n",

       "      <td>The United States has plummeted to 28th place on an annual ranking of the world's most equal countries for men and women, falling behind Rwanda, an East African country ravaged by genocide in 1994.Rwandan women beat American women in both labor force participation and government representation, according to the World Economic Forum’s Global Gender Gap Report. Eighty-eight percent of women in Rwanda have jobs, compared to 66 percent of women in the U.S. A whopping 64 percent of the African nation’s politicians are women, compared to our 19 percent.It's important to note that Rwanda, which placed sixth on the list, also boasts more gender equality than France (15th), Spain (25th), Germany (11th), Switzerland (8th) and Denmark (14th). Each country was graded on labor participation, health, political empowerment and educational attainment.So, how did Rwanda blaze past much of the Western world in women’s economic and political opportunity? The answer lies in recent history.The Rwandan genocide, a mass slaughter of the Tutsi minority population, tore apart families and killed roughly 800,000 adults and children in 100 days. Hutu extremists destroyed communities, raping an estimated 500,000 women.After the tragedy ended in July 1994, women banded together and demanded power. They changed the country’s constitution to require that women hold at least 30 percent of top political roles. They called for true equality in marriage. They took over farms. They delayed starting families to work and earn more.In a story for The Guardian last year, reporter Alexandra Topping, who visited Kigali, the country’s capital, wrote: “A swath of laws have given women the right to inherit land, share the assets of a marriage and obtain credit. As many girls as boys receive primary and secondary education, maternal mortality is lower and the birth rate is falling.”Things, of course, aren’t perfect. Topping notes that domestic violence still plagues households, despite public campaigns to stop it. And average lifespans in Rwanda remain low, the WEF report highlighted: 57 years old for women and 55 for men.The U.S., meanwhile, plunged eight slots on the gender equality ranking this year, slipping out of the report’s top 20. The wage gap and fewer women in senior government positions appear to have propelled the drop.Beyond discrimination, economists say both issues are exacerbated by America's lack of family-friendly policies, the soaring cost of child care and the cultural expectation that women, even sole breadwinners, should shoulder the bulk of domestic responsibilities. A recent Pew survey of more than 1,800 U.S. parents found both men and women have trouble balancing job responsibilities with family life. Mothers, however, reported tackling more chores than fathers, regardless of who earned more money: Sixty-four percent of female respondents said the majority of household work fell to them.American women also experienced an uneven recovery since the last economic downtown, which dragged down their labor force participation.About 8.7 million jobs disappeared during the last recession. American men have encountered less trouble getting back to work, according to the Economic Policy Institute. Between February 2010 and June 2014, they gained 5.5 million jobs, while women gained 3.6 million.Related:How American women fell behind Japanese women in the workplaceBoston is offering free salary negotiation workshops to every woman who works in the city</td>\n",

       "40    A record-breaking number of women were elected to the British Parliament in Thursday’s election, with many calling it a “historic” moment. When legislators return to Westminster next week, there will be 208 women among their ranks, or 32 percent of Parliament. The majority of the parties are also led by women. In fact, Prime Minister Theresa May is now negotiating with another woman, Arlene Foster of Northern Ireland’s Democratic Unionist Party, to form a government.But is this election really a turning point for women in the United Kingdom?Despite the headlines, these results represent only an incremental change — a gain of just 12 more seats for women. And although women might be better represented in Parliament than in the U.S. Congress, the United Kingdom still lags behind most European and Latin American democracies. Thursday’s election moved it from 46 to 39 in the global rankings. Focusing on the headline number also obscures significant variation across parties and regions.The parties aren’t alikeAs with the Democrats in the United States, women’s representation is highest in the center-left Labour Party. Women hold 45 percent of Labour seats (119 of 262) compared with 21 percent of Conservative seats. In fact, the number of women parliamentarians in the Conservative Party actually decreased from 70 to 67 in this election.The difference between the parties is because of a strategy — “all-women shortlists” — adopted by the Labour Party in 1994. Labour requires that half of all winnable seats be contested by female candidates. When it was partially implemented for the first time in 1997, women’s numbers grew from 37 to 101. Since being fully implemented from 2005 onwards, women’s representation has never fallen below 27 percent.Scotland is different, tooThere is also variation within the U.K. itself. Women’s representation actually decreased in Scotland. This is in large part because of the Conservative gains in the region: among the thirteen returning members of Parliament, only one is a woman. And this is despite the striking prominence of women in Scottish politics, where the leaders of the three major parties are all women, and First Minister Nicola Sturgeon appointed a gender-balanced Cabinet.The U.K. isn’t close to gender parityThe U.K. remains a long way from gender parity in Parliament. To get there, the Conservatives will have to increase the number of female candidates competing in winnable seats. They’ve tried to bolster women’s numbers before through “soft” measures — such as the Women2Win initiative co-founded by Theresa May to support and train Conservative women, and the gender balanced “priority list” of prospective candidates that local parties were encouraged to select from (although it proved unpopular and was soon abandoned).Despite acknowledging the need for more women in politics, the Conservative Party remains opposed to a strategy like all-women shortlists. Their resistance is not surprising. While there are right-leaning parties in Western Europe with voluntary quotas (including the German Christian Democrats and Austrian People’s Party), no conservative party in the region has been willing to implement this strategy.Moreover, Britain, unlike more than 75 countries across the globe, has not adopted legislation that mandates the selection or election of female candidates for office. A growing number of European countries have done so, including France in 1999, Ireland in 2012 and Poland in 2011.What comes next? One crucial issue on the agenda: women’s reproductive rights. The governing coalition will likely include the Conservative Party and Northern Ireland’s Democratic Unionist Party, and the DUP has consistently campaigned to limit abortion rights. The DUP’s former health minister, Jim Wells, has even argued against abortion in cases of rape. Newly elected MP Owen Paterson confirmed in an interview yesterday that abortion restrictions might be up for debate.At the same time, May’s position is precarious, and many observers do not expect this fragile coalition to last long. If new elections are on the horizon, then we will soon see whether there will be further increases in women’s representation — and if so, what that means for public policy.Mary Nugent is a PhD candidate in political science at Rutgers University.

       "121   When I went to Uganda in 1992, I was interested in understanding why the country had so many women in top government positions and why it had the highest rates of representation of women in parliament in Africa at the time. During my research, I realized that a key reason was war. Uganda had just emerged from years of major conflict. Relations between women and men had begun to change, and as a result, women started to mobilize for their rights.Over time, it became evident that post-conflict countries had considerably higher rates of female political representation than countries that had not suffered through violence. Post-conflict Liberia was the first African country to elect a woman president. As early as 1994, post-conflict Uganda already had a woman vice president for 10 years. Post-conflict Rwanda today has the highest rate of female legislative representation in the world – 63.8 percent of its legislators are women – and has held that spot since 2003.My latest book, “Women and Power in Postconflict Africa” (Cambridge University Press 2015), shows how the trends I observed in Uganda in the early 1990s became evident in many of the 16 other African countries that came out of conflict, especially after 2000. Across Africa, countries emerging from major conflict were quicker to advance women’s rights and elect women to political office than countries that had remained less conflicted. What is more, post-conflict nations went further in changing their laws and constitutions, offering women more strong legal protections in the areas of land rights, family law, violence and political equality.And it is not just in Africa. We see more women in office after conflict around the world, in such places as Slovenia, Nepal and East Timor.This post-1990s pattern echoes earlier transformations in women’s citizenship, when World War I shook up gender norms across Europe and the United States. Women mobilized for the vote in many countries for decades, but it was only after the war that they finally gained suffrage.The book is based both on extensive fieldwork in Uganda, Liberia and Angola, and on in-depth analysis that compares post-conflict and non-conflict countries across Africa. It also builds on a longitudinal study that I carried out with Melanie Hughes, in which we found statistical evidence of the relationship between women’s legislative representation and the end of major wars that were particularly long or had very high rates of conflict-related deaths.Advancing women’s rights is an unexpected byproduct of warThe Nordic countries took more than 100 years to get equal numbers of women and men in their legislatures. After civil wars, some African countries exceeded their rates almost overnight.None of this, however, happened before the 1990s, a time when women’s rights activists had made gains in legal reform in many African countries and pressured United Nations agencies, foreign donors and international organizations to promote those rights worldwide.Of course, women’s rights activists in post-conflict countries say that the changes have been all too slow and halting. But even the impatience with the the pace of change tells us how much expectations have been transformed. In nondemocratic countries such as Angola, Chad and Eritrea, we see fewer changes, in part because citizens have few political rights and civil liberties.But looking at the big picture in a country like Uganda, we see new women leaders in business, civil society, academia, religious institutions and a host of institutions in which they had previously been invisible. We also see changes in attitudes toward women and women’s leadership. In some countries the changes were more extensive than others, where sometimes one saw change only along a few dimensions.In Angola, for example, women increased their numbers in the legislature but won fewer legal and constitutional rights. But that is, in part, because Angola is not a democracy, and so women were not able to create organizations independent of the government and other dominant political powers. Creating a women’s rights agenda requires women to build coalitions across parties, ethnicities and other identities and affiliations – which can then make demands of the ruling party.Why did post-conflict countries advance women’s status so quickly? Here is why. During conflicts, women are pushed into new roles in the economy, in their households and communities and even in national politics. While some women also fought, others became active in peace movements, which have often been led by women or involved large numbers of women – and then use the transition to peace as a time to demand equality.In Africa, for instance, women were among those most engaged in behind-the-scenes peacemaking, pressuring militia to lay down their arms, demonstrating for peaceful elections and negotiating the release of kidnapped civilians. Further, women gain credibility after these conflicts, since they have been political outsiders, uninvolved with leading the militias and paramilitaries and not responsible for the violence – making a vote for a woman seen as a break with the disastrously violent status quo.From these positions, women often try to influence peace negotiations to include women’s rights planks into the peace accords. The results include quotas for women on candidate slates; explicit listing of sexual violence as a war crime during transitional justice processes, and requirements to include women at the table where new constitutions are being written. Sometimes international donors and other international actors supported and pressured for these results.Some kinds of conflict produced more advances in women’s rights than others While no one would ever advocate war as a route to advancing women, my research showed that the longer or more deadly the war, the more advances women make. That is, in part, because when society is seriously ruptured by war, it is easier to persuade people to adopt new norms, institutions and include new political actors.Further, after a civil war, women’s rights had a better chance of improving if the conflict ended with peace negotiations rather than a decisive victory for one side, as happened in Angola and Sri Lanka. Women and international non-governmental organizations had less power to add women’s rights to the laws and constitutions if one dominant side simply took power than if they were at the table while peace was negotiated and constitutions were rewritten.Finally, women made more advances after major civil wars or wars of national liberation than after interstate or proxy wars, or after low-level conflict, local rebellions or coups d’état. For instance, consider the ongoing conflict in Somalia. There is not enough stability for leaders to worry about legislative reform – and so we should not expect much legal change with respect to women’s status during conflict.Aili Mari Tripp is a professor of political science and gender and women’s studies at the University of Wisconsin at Madison.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",
       "276   Western European countries have long led the world on gender equality, but the latest annual Gender Gap Report, just issued by the World Economic Forum, shows that the U.S. is making significant gains in an area where it has often lagged the Western world.The annual WEF report grades countries on five metrics to measure the degree of gender equality or inequality: economic participation and opportunity, educational attainment, health and survival, and political empowerment. Countries are scored between 0.0 for most unequal, meaning that women have zero access, or 1.0 for fully equal.The 2012 report ranks the U.S. 22nd in the world. The only non-Western nations that rank higher than the U.S., meaning their societies are more equal for women, are South Africa, Cuba, Lesotho, Nicaragua, and the Philippines. American society has been catching up to its historical leaders, as this chart of WEF gender equality scores across Western Europe since 2006 shows.I haven't included Scandinavian countries in this chart. Their scores are so high that it would make it to difficult to portray the U.S.'s relative gains against the rest of Western Europe. But what's also striking about this is the relatively poor gender equality in two of Western Europe's largest economies and more liberal societies: France and Italy.In the broader European context, the U.S. is in fact a better place for women, judging by the WEF data, than is the majority of the continent. Here's a map of Europe, color-coded by gender equality. The blue countries are, according to the WEF data, more accessible societies for women than is the United States, with darker blue signifying better scores. The red countries are less friendly societies for women, with darker red signifying worse scores.This map tells a few different stories. The first is the striking degrees of inequality that remain in Western Europe. In the cases of Spain and France, that has worsened considerably over recent years. The second is the remarkable successes that women have found in Scandinavian countries, by far the most equal for women in the world. And perhaps the third would be the deep problems of gender inequality that persist in much of the former Soviet Union. I'll be looking more into several of these issues throughout the day, so check back.

       "528   On election night in November, many cheered a relative milestone: For the first time ever, there would be more than 100 women in the U.S. Congress. Yet while that may be a record high, it doesn't look as impressive when compared with other high-income nations — or even many lower-income ones.The Pew Research Center released a data analysis Monday of a 2014 World Economic Forum report on the gender gap. The analysis examined how the U.S. compares to other countries when it comes to having women in top government posts, and the results aren't reassuring.Among 49 \"high income\" countries, the United States ranks 33rd when it comes to women in legislative roles. Sweden was first. Meanwhile, among a larger group of 137 countries, it came in 83rd. Pew notes that the WEF data is from May 2014, but that even if numbers from the current Congress were analyzed, the United States would still come in just 75th.America did better in other categories, but still fell behind many of its peers. Among high-income countries, it tied with Canada for 12th place on the share of Cabinet-level positions held by women. Among all countries, it was 25th. In this case, however, Pew found that the ratio of U.S. Cabinet positions held by women has actually gone down since the WEF's report, which presumably would mean the U.S. ranking could be even lower.One category in which the United States fared better was that of \"legislators, senior officials and managers.\" It tied for fourth place among high-income countries — with Barbados and Trinidad and Tobago — in this ranking that measures women's representation across multiple leadership positions including corporate managers, legislators, top political party officials and nonprofit leaders. (When the larger group of countries was analyzed, it was tied for 16th with Namibia.)What's holding women back in the United States? Pew addressed that question as part of its Women and Leadership survey, the first in a series of reports about the topic, of which this analysis is a part. In the survey, 38 percent of respondents said more women did not reach higher political office because they are held to higher standards, while 37 percent thought it was because others weren't ready to elect them. Just 17 percent attributed the low numbers to women's family responsibilities, and 27 percent to a lack of support from political parties.Read also:More than 100 women in Congress for the first time—and not much growthBecky Hammon's path to the NBALike On Leadership?

       "1073  It's still months until September, when Britain's next prime minister will be named, and November, when the United States will elect its next president. But the political turmoil that's erupted following Britain's vote to leave the European Union has put in place the possibility of a profoundly historic moment: By next January, women could lead the three largest Western economies.Yes, it's early, and yes, it's still totally speculative. But the possibility that women could lead the United States, Britain and Germany at the same time is also a very real one. Angela Merkel's term as chancellor of Germany is not up until the fall of 2017, when the country will hold its next election. Hillary Clinton is poised to become the first female nominee of a major U.S. political party, and she is currently leading in many polls against Donald Trump, the presumptive GOP nominee.And with the decision by former London Mayor Boris Johnson not to run to be the Conservative Party's next leader -- who will replace David Cameron in September as Britain's prime minister -- Home Secretary Theresa May has vaulted into the lead as the favorite among British oddsmakers. Meanwhile, a YouGov/Times poll also put her in the lead, though it did not include Michael Gove, the justice secretary who had repeatedly said he didn't want the job but shocked Britain Thursday with the announcement that he did.\"This is not crazy stuff -- it's a moment to take note of,\" said Debbie Walsh, director of the Center for American Women in Politics at Rutgers University. \"Even the fact, honestly, that two women are among the two leading candidates [in the U.S. and Britain] -- that it could even possibly happen -- is in and of itself historic. It’s really extraordinary. There’s never been anything like that before, where it was even in the realm of possibility, let alone happen.\" Britain, of course, has had a female prime minister before: Margaret Thatcher served from 1979 to 1990. Merkel is Germany's first female chancellor, a position she has held since 2005. The United States, meanwhile, has never had a female nominee from a major political party.May voted to remain in the European Union, though she is noted to have done so \"gently,\" keeping a low profile and still finding fans among \"Euroskeptics\" for her immigration policies. That position could make her less attractive as the person to negotiate Britain's exit -- or it could make her be seen as more of a unifier, a role she is casting herself in. \"That's nice middle ground at a moment when Great Britain is quite at odds with itself about this decision,\" Walsh said.Then there is also Marine Le Pen, who leads the far right National Front party in France. The next French presidential election will be in the spring of 2017, which the Post's Michael Birnbaum writes \"appears ripe for an insurgent candidate such as Le Pen,\" particularly after the recent Brexit vote. He reports that while she leads many polls for France's crowded first round of voting, she falls behind Hollande in the second, head-to-head vote.If in fact there do end up being two, or three, or even more women around the table at the next G-8 Summit, Walsh says that image could radically reshuffle how we view the opportunity for getting women into global leadership roles. \"It could disrupt our image of who world leaders can be,\" she said, \"and would do so at a very, very high level.\"Read also:A Hillary Clinton-Elizabeth Warren pairing would be profoundly unusual — and not just in national politicsThe startling leadership vacuum in post-Brexit BritainLike On Leadership?

       "3881  Although some analysts have criticized the focus of Western governments and NGOs on goals such as trying to increase the number of women in parliaments, enhancing women’s representation remains a central objective of many international democracy promotion efforts in the Arab world. But the impacts of these efforts are more complex than they might appear. Lila Abu Lughod’s provocative recent book, “Do Muslim Women Need Saving?” challenges what she refers to as a Western “moral crusade to rescue oppressed Muslim women from their cultures and their religion [that] has swept the public sphere.” She notes that international, and especially U.S., pressure on Muslim governments to improve on certain measures of gender equality could actually undermine the local legitimacy of feminist causes.Is she right? In “Anti-Americanism, Authoritarian Politics, and Attitudes about Women’s Representation: Evidence from a Survey Experiment in Jordan,” an article published by International Studies Quarterly in July, we report on a unique experimental study that examines how U.S. and domestic endorsements of women in politics affect local attitudes about women’s representation in Jordan.We focus on Jordan for several reasons. First, the international community – including the United States – has strongly pressured Jordan to improve women’s representation, including through the adoption of measures such as gender quotas for its elected national parliament and local councils. Although Jordan is a monarchy that is strongly allied with the United States and European countries, it has been subject to the same international democracy promotion efforts pushing for the adoption of gender quotas that have occurred globally. Second, anti-American attitudes are widespread in Jordan, which heightens the possibility that foreign support for women’s representation could engender a local backlash.Our study draws on evidence from a nationally representative survey of the political attitudes of 1,650 adults in Jordan in November 2010. The survey contained a randomized experiment that was designed to help us understand the effects of foreign support for gender equality on local attitudes. The experiment contained three conditions. We first told a group of randomly selected respondents about Jordan’s quota and the support of a U.S. government-funded organization for women’s political participation in Jordan. Then, as a point of comparison, we told a group of randomly selected respondents about Jordan’s quota and the support of some Jordanian imams for women’s political participation. Finally, a control group received only information about Jordan’s quota. After obtaining their experimental treatments, all respondents were asked questions about their support for women’s representation, including women running for parliament and serving as municipal councilors.Our findings about the effects of the endorsements were surprising. Although few respondents expressed trust in the United States, providing them with information about a U.S. organization’s support for Jordan’s gender quota did not depress their support for women’s representation on average when compared to the control group. For example, 64 percent of respondents in the control condition expressed willingness to vote for a woman running for parliament, whereas 66 percent of respondents in the U.S. treatment did so – a small increase that was not statistically significant. Our analysis suggests that this null finding is not driven by respondents’ preexisting beliefs about the endorsers’ support for gender equality, their preexisting trust in the endorsers, or their levels of political knowledge.Moreover, although most respondents expressed trust in local imams, we found that providing them with information about these religious leaders’ support for Jordan’s gender quota did not increase their support for this issue on average. Both local and international reformers often seek out endorsements from trusted religious leaders for their policy goals. It is not clear, however, from this evidence that such strategies will always pay off. For example, an identical 64 percent of respondents in the control and religious endorsement conditions expressed willingness to vote for a woman running for parliament.Finally, our study uncovered some preliminary evidence that both U.S. and religious endorsements reduce support for women’s representation more among women who opposed the monarchy than supported it. That finding holds even though regime opponents and supporters have similar attitudes about gender. To interpret those unexpected findings, we argue that, in autocracies, disposition toward the incumbent regime is an important cleavage that shapes citizens’ receptivity to endorsements. This interpretation dovetails with research by Dan Corstange and Nikolay Marinov that shows how foreign endorsements polarized domestic attitudes in Lebanon.These findings challenge much of the conventional wisdom about international democracy promotion in the Middle East. Some observers after the Arab Spring urged the United States and other foreign actors not to undermine the legitimacy of local reformers’ efforts. According to Al Jazeera’s former director general, Wadah Khanfar, for example, “what is most important about the Arab spring is that it is coming from Arabs themselves.” At least in the case of gender quotas in Jordan, however, the results suggest that foreign endorsements of political reforms will not necessarily delegitimize the cause, even when delivered by American groups that publics might generally distrust. As we note in the article: “If American support has no average negative impact on public attitudes toward women in politics, the net effect of active American efforts to promote women’s representation is more likely to be beneficial.”Sarah Bush is an assistant professor of political science at Temple University and a senior fellow with the Project on Democratic Transitions at the Foreign Policy Research Institute.

       "3956  CAIRO — After Egyptian women stood shoulder to shoulder with men in the protests that toppled Hosni Mubarak, many looked forward to a role in the revolution’s next steps. But 15 months later, as Egyptians prepare to vote for a new president this week, rights activists complain that women are being excluded from key decisions.“At the time of the revolution, women were needed to fill out the numbers,” said Hoda Badran, head of the Egyptian Feminist Union, which was banned under Mubarak but reinstated last year. “Now, the decision-makers don’t need women, and we’re back to this idea that femininity is inferior and masculinity superior.”Women hold just over 2 percent of the seats in Egypt’s new parliament, down from about 12 percent in the last elections held under Mubarak. The sharp decline followed the elimination of a quota to ensure women’s representation, which had been seen by many as a way to stack the body with members of Mubarak’s political party.Military rulers did not include any women in the committee that wrote constitutional amendments adopted in a nationwide referendum last year. And there are no women among the 13 candidates who will be on the ballot Wednesday, when voting begins in the country’s first post-Mubarak presidential election.Badran and other women’s rights activists are particularly worried that the well-organized Muslim Brotherhood will use its religious and charitable groups to encourage uneducated and poor women to vote for its candidate, Mohammed Morsi. Morsi opposes women being allowed to serve in the presidency. He has called for the implementation of Islamic law and, at campaign rallies, referred to Islam’s holy book, the Koran, as the constitution.To counter the Brotherhood, Badran’s group has hired hundreds of buses to take women to the polls. It is also distributing pamphlets that encourage women to vote for a candidate who respects women, who doesn’t use religion to campaign and who doesn’t lie, Badran said. The group has not endorsed a candidate.Among its Arab neighbors, Egypt boasts some of the strongest legal protections for women. Women here can sue for divorce. They are a significant part of the workforce, and they are not subject to an Islamic dress code. Egyptian women who are married to foreign men can pass on citizenship to their children, unlike in more socially liberal countries such as Lebanon, where they cannot.But the Islamist-dominated parliament is discussing several proposals that could change women’s status here. They include lowering the legal age of marriage for girls from 18 to 13 and revoking divorced mothers’ custody of their boys at age 7 and girls at 9, rather than at 15, a move that would be in accordance with a strict interpretation of Islamic law.The existing rules were projects of Suzanne Mubarak, the former first lady, a strong advocate of laws to protect women and children’s rights. But she was also accused of monopolizing the issue and putting laws on the books that were never implemented, while independent women’s groups were not allowed to flourish.Of all of Egypt’s political blocs the Muslim Brotherhood’s Freedom and Justice Party has the most female lawmakers in parliament, though many women’s rights activists see them as part of a religious organization that traditionally has not allowed women full-fledged membership.Azza el-Garf, a mother of seven and a member of parliament, has come under intense criticism from liberals and women’s right groups for advocating the revisiting of hard-won laws that women had thought were irreversible, such as the right for women to divorce their husbands and the age of marriage.“When creating laws that concern the families, they need to be in line with Islamic law,” Garf said. But she insisted that the nine women elected to Egypt’s new parliament “gave a big push for the image of women in politics.” (Two other women were appointed to parliament, bringing the total to 11.)At a weekend conference in Cairo, presidential hopefuls were invited to speak to thousands of female voters about their agendas and how they related to women’s rights. Only five candidates attended, with most of the leading candidates absent.Ashraf Rasheed, a representative of Amr Moussa, the former Arab League chief and the liberal front-runner, said that if Moussa wins, he will appoint a female vice president. The audience burst into applause, though Rasheed was then asked to explain why Moussa himself had not attended.Ghada Kamal, a young activist who said she was severely beaten and detained by military police during clashes outside the cabinet building this past winter, is more concerned about the loss of the revolution’s focus on dismantling Mubarak’s regime than about women’s rights. And she’s not sure whether she will vote.“The Egyptian woman discovered she is strong, not weak or oppressed as she had imagined, and that she has a very important role to play, just like a man,” Kamal said. “I don’t think anything has changed for women or men in terms of human or social rights. If this had happened, we would have said that the revolution succeeded.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
       "4870  The news that Canada’s Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has named a gender-balanced cabinet — and one that is more representative along other dimensions, including religion and ability — is refreshing. (The cabinet of his predecessor, Steven Harper, included six women among its 26 members in 2006).Even more encouraging than Trudeau’s leadership on this issue — and his lack of excuses — is his apparent understanding of the need to address inequality. When asked why he named a government comprised of 50 percent women, he said simply, “Because it’s 2015.” As succinct as his response was, it reflects much greater clarity about the problem of inequality — and its solution — than much public discussion on the issue.Scholars who study politics and gender reject conventional wisdom that women’s marginalization from leadership is due to poorer performance or lesser qualifications (women now outnumber men in advanced degrees in the United States, as in conservative Islamic countries), arguing instead that it reflects unfair recruitment practices. In addition to gender-based biases, inequality can also arise from basic social practices, including the tendency to socialize with others of the same gender. Men simply know fewer women and often prefer to work with other males. This observation helps expose the fallacy that gender equality will be easily achieved without institutional solutions like quotas.Unfortunately, debates about gender have also figured prominently in the U.S. presidential primary races, and in troubling ways. Despite the presence of female candidates Hillary Clinton and Carly Fiorina, public debate on and media coverage of the issue are often devoid of an understanding of the mechanisms that create and perpetuate inequality.In a recent article in Governance — currently ungated — I write about issues of women’s access to government resources and the role that often overlooked structural factors play in contributing to this problem. Although my research takes place in two authoritarian countries in North Africa, it highlights why subtle social dynamics can perpetuate women and other minorities’ lack of access to political power, even when social stereotypes and sexism are diminishing in society in general.Drawing on an original survey of 200 Moroccan and Algerian parliamentarians and field research conducted 2006-2007, I investigate the link between parliamentarian gender, quotas, and service provision to women. A form of constituency service, parliamentary clientelism refers to providing help with personal and community problems, including medical services, judicial or bureaucratic corruption, jobs, money or grants, or electricity. Due to high levels of corruption and economic difficulties in many non-democratic settings, elected officials often spend much of their time trying to help citizens with these issues. Yet I find that women are relatively excluded from these informal service networks with parliamentarians, due in part to structural factors. On average, 20-29 percent of requests that Moroccan and Algerian parliamentarians receive are from women. The effects of gender quotas are striking. While electing women increases service responsiveness to females, parliamentarians elected through quotas experience mandates to help women and are more responsive to females than members of either sex elected without quotas.To explain gender gaps in clientelistic services — and to think about why progress toward gender parity in United States and many other relatively egalitarian societies has stalled — I extend Elin Bjarnegård’s (2013) theory of homosocial capital, which she developed to explain male dominance in Thai parliamentary politics. Homosociality refers to friendships, collaborations and other non-romantic relationships with others of the same gender. Bjarnegård argues that, as long as males are numerically dominant in positions of power, they will continue to enjoy advantages accumulating homosocial capital — predictable relationships with individuals who are similar and have resources needed to win elections.According to Bjarnegård, homosocial capital is composed of instrumental and expressive resources. Expressive resources are dispositional similarities which facilitate close, predictable relationships and access to instrumental resources needed to succeed in campaigns.Men and women often prefer friendship and work collaboration with others of the same gender, due to greater ease relating (e.g., similar behavior and interests, fewer conflicts and sexual harassment concerns, higher trust). Male dominance is reproduced because instrumental and expressive resources are seldom in opposition for men. Males have more instrumental resources and can rely on homosocial linkages. In contrast, women must foster heterosocial networks to obtain resources, while enjoying less expressive resources, such as trust and familiarity, in networks with men.I extend Bjarnegård’s theory of homosocial capital accumulation by incorporating structural and normative aspects of patriarchy into the framework and identifying two gender gaps: in parliamentarians’ supply of and citizens’ demand for services. Patriarchal structures are formal laws and policies such as personal status (e.g., marriage, divorce, inheritance, mobility) and employment laws (e.g., wage discrimination, sex segregation) which give males more instrumental resources and reproduce stereotypes about women’s traits and abilities (i.e., what women are like and can do), including their ability to provide wasta (use of a connection to gets things one needs). Patriarchal norms and attitudes are traditional views of gender roles which identify public space as male, discourage mixing of unrelated males and females, and justify gender discrimination (i.e., what women should do).Exclusion of women from service provision occurs through mutually-reinforcing structural and dispositional factors operating on the supply and demand-side of exchanges. On the instrumental, supply-side, patriarchal structures limit female deputies’ instrumental resources needed to provide services. Because female leaders enjoy fewer patronage networks, women are less likely to be seen as good wastas and are less able to run and succeed in elections (see Table 1).In Tunisia, 19.1 percent saw male deputies as better service providers, compared to 6.9 percent who saw women as better (73.9 percent believed there was no difference), according to a 2014 Transitional Governance Project survey of 1200 Tunisians conducted by United Nations Democracy Fund and Centre d’Études Maghrébines à Tunis, in collaboration with Lindsay Benstead, Ellen Lust, Dhafer Malouche and JMW Consulting.In Jordan, 45.4 percent saw males as better, compared to 13.5 percent females (41.1 percent, no difference), according to a 2014 Program on Governance and Local Development poll conducted among 1,488 Jordanians by Lindsay Benstead, Kristen Kao and Ellen Lust.In Libya, 28.2 percent believed a man would be more effective, compared to 10.9 percent women (60.9 percent, no difference), according to a 2013 National Democratic Institute poll of 1200 Libyans conducted by Diwan Research and the Transitional Governance Project, in collaboration with Lindsay Benstead, Ellen Lust, and JMW Consulting.Table 1. Mechanisms of exclusion from service provisionOn the instrumental, demand side, patriarchal structures exclude women from public space (e.g., employment, politics), giving them fewer resources and influence. Women are less likely to be civically engaged or lead civil society groups, Sufi brotherhoods, and tribes — groups which are critical for winning semi-competitive elections.The Transitional Governance Project found voting in first post-uprisings parliamentary elections was 77 percent for Egyptian men, 58 percent for women; 75 percent for Tunisian men, 65 percent for women; and, 84 percent for Libyan men, 59 percent for women. As a result, serving women is a less effecti  \n",
       "4892  In becoming Britain’s second female prime minister, Theresa May has made the country just the sixth in Europe (and 17th in the world) to have had more than one female leader.May, like her female predecessor Margaret Thatcher, is a Conservative. Her party’s main rival, the Labour Party, has had a parade of white male leaders. Although Margaret Beckett and Harriet Harman served as interim Labour Party leaders, neither was elected to that post.Which party has better female representation: Conservative or Labour?So is the Conservative Party beating Labour 2 to 0 in representing women in politics, as former prime minister David Cameron quipped in his final Prime Minister’s Questions? Is it true that the Conservative Party, as Boris Johnson said last week, is “the most progressive party in Britain” when it comes to representing women? No, in at least two important ways.First, on the benches of the House of Commons, only 21 percent of Conservative Party MPs are women — less than half that of the Labour Party, whose MPS are now 43 percent women. In fact, for almost two decades, Labour has consistently had about twice the proportion of women as has the Conservative Party, as the graph below shows.Second, unlike the Conservatives, Labour has consistently used robust policies in selecting candidates to guarantee healthy female representation on their slate.Here’s how Britain’s Labour Party boosted female representation in Parliament More than 100 political parties around the world — including Labour — use what are called “gender quota.” Labour’s gender quota policy, called all-women shortlists, was first used for the 1997 election. It commits the party to considering only female candidates in at least half of all “winnable” seats that come open.The policy’s results were dramatic. That year, the proportion of women in the Parliamentary Labour Party went from 14 percent to 24 percent, and the number of women in parliament overall doubled from 60 to 120. Labour has continued to use all-women shortlists in selecting its candidates for general elections ever since, with one exception. During the 2001 election, a legal challenge made the practice illegal. But a Labour-dominated Parliament amended the Equality Act to accommodate the provision.Here’s how the British Conservative Party tried to boost female representation in Parliament By contrast, the Conservative Party’s attempts to increase the number of female MPs have been significantly less effective. From the mid-2000s, Conservative gender-equality activists pressured party leaders to pay more attention to the underrepresentation of women. May, now prime minister, co-founded one key effort: Women2win, an organization to encourage and support women entering into Conservative Party politics. As Sarah Childs, Paul Webb and Sally Marthaler argued in the journal Political Quarterly, these efforts were important in changing party attitudes.In fact, after being selected party leader in 2005, David Cameron spent much of his acceptance speech promising that the party will “change the scandalous under-representation of women in the Conservative Party.” Within the year, the party introduced what it called priority candidate list — or the “A-List,” of about 150 aspiring candidates, from which local party organizers were encouraged to select. The party promised that the A-List would be at least 50 percent women and that a “significant” proportion would be nonwhite, and also introduced rules for gender-balanced shortlisting during the candidate-selection process.In Political Quarterly, Rosie Campbell, Joni Lovenduski and Childs argued that Cameron’s increased emphasis on getting more women into Parliament was an important evolution of the Conservative Party, raising awareness within the party of the need to “modernize” and appeal to female voters. But relatively few local party constituencies (equivalent to, in the United States, a district party organization) selected women from the A-List, and it was abandoned altogether in 2012. While Conservative Party leaders encouraged them to voluntarily select all-female shortlists themselves, no local party chose to do so. Although more Conservative women were elected in 2010, they still made up only a modest 16 percent of Conservative MPs, a bit more than half of Labour’s 31 percent.So what kinds of policies actually lead to gender equality in politics? Lovenduski in her book “Feminizing Politics” puts attempts to tackle women’s political underrepresentation into three categories: equality rhetoric, equality promotion and equality guarantees. While the Conservative Party in the past decade has had plenty of equality rhetoric and promotion — which Lovenduski considers important steps toward “feminizing politics” — it has stopped short of guaranteeing equality. Labour, by contrast, took steps to guarantee equal representation. Political scientists, such as Mona Lena Krook, have consistently found that robust equality guarantees in the form of gender quotas are the surest route to increasing women’s representation at all levels in politics. The results can be counted.Of course, only the Conservative Party has put women into the top spotIt’s true that the Conservative Party has now put women in the most exceptional position in Britain: that of prime minister. But it has not gone far in diversifying its gender composition. As Diana O’Brien and Karen Beckwith wrote here earlier this week, both Thatcher and May came to power after political crises, which is often the way women become political leaders. That might soon happen in the Labour Party as well; if Angela Eagle succeeds in challenging Jeremy Corbyn for leader, she too may take over at a time of organizational disaster.In other words, even women’s rise to the top of the party may not indicate a commitment to institutional change; rather, it’s a product of political convenience and circumstance.Nugent is a PhD candidate at Rutgers University at New Brunswick, studying women and politics.

       "6078  On Sunday, Ecuadorians head to the polls to elect legislators as well as a replacement for the thrice-elected President Rafael Correa, the longest-serving chief executive in the country’s history. Along with policy changes, the country may see some shifts in the proportion of female legislators.Here’s what you need to know about Ecuador’s presidential and legislative elections, where voting is mandatory:1) There are 8 presidential candidates The last official survey results, released Feb. 8 before a government-imposed media blackout, showed a tight race. Front-runners are the ruling Alianza PAIS (AP) candidate, Lenín Moreno, who served as vice president from 2007 to 2013; and the Creando Oportunidades (CREO) movement’s Guillermo Lasso, a conservative former economy minister and banker who was a distant presidential runner-up in 2013.The Feb. 8 survey of decided and undecided voters gave Moreno 32 percent of likely votes versus 21 percent for Lasso, and 14 percent for former congresswoman Cynthia Viteri. The center-left ex-mayor of Quito, Paco Moncayo, has just 8 percent support, and the four other candidates representing minor parties are polling at 4 percent or less for each. Nearly 12 percent of respondents would cast a null vote to reject the field.However, a whopping 35 percent of these voters are undecided, meaning more than a third of Ecuadorians are not wedded to a single candidate, adding a high degree of uncertainty to Sunday’s proceedings. 2) This is what Ecuador’s electoral system looks likeEcuador uses a two-round voting system for its presidential election. To win outright and avoid a runoff election, presidential candidates need to get 40 percent of the vote and hold at least a 10 percent advantage over the nearest rival in the first round. The poll numbers suggest no candidate will win outright, however.It seems likely that Moreno will end up in an April 2 runoff with Lasso or Viteri. Given political polarization in the country, the opposition hopes that anti-government sentiment will push voters to coalesce around a single candidate.Ecuadorians will also cast National Assembly votes this Sunday, using the rare free list electoral system, which is somewhat like an extreme version of open lists. Some countries elect their parliaments or congresses using an open list, which lets voters choose among candidates on the list. Others use a closed electoral list, where voters vote for the party itself, rather than individual candidates.Ecuador’s system, however, allows voters to choose individuals not only within party lists, but among different parties as well. In other words, voters may choose an entire slate of candidates from their party — as in a closed-list system — or cast individual nominal votes among the candidates.3) How have rules and voter behavior boosted representation by women? In 2015, Ecuador boasted the third-highest percentage of female legislators in Latin America (53 of 137 assembly members, or 39 percent of its unicameral legislature), behind only Bolivia (53 percent) and Nicaragua (40 percent). Just 25 years earlier, women failed to exceed even 7 percent of Ecuador’s legislature.Many of these great strides reflect Ecuador’s legislative efforts on gender representation. In 1997, lawmakers introduced a 20 percent quota on party lists, which would increase by 5 percent for each election cycle until parity was achieved.This law was replaced by Articles 99(1) and 160 of the 2009 Electoral Law, which establish a 50 percent quota — parity — and the alternation of male and female candidates on proportional representation candidate lists, known as the “zipper method.” This means if a party won four seats in a district, for instance, it would be represented in Congress by two male and two female legislators. 4) How might the unusual voting system affect women’s representation in 2017?In a working project, Tom Mustillo of Purdue University and I found that, buoyed by Correa’s strong presidential coattails and high public approval, AP voters tend to use the party-list option under the free list. But opposition voters tend to cast individual votes across party lines.The effects on women’s representation are noticeable. Of the 53 female legislators elected in 2013, 46 were Alianza PAIS candidates, and only 7 came from other parties. In fact, as Figure 1 shows, 46 percent of AP legislators were women, compared with just 19 percent of opposition legislators.AP voters may be more enlightened with regard to gender than are voters at large. But it’s likely that the way voters use the free-list system affects the effectiveness of laws enacted to create gender quotas. Without Correa at the helm of AP, will voters shy away from party lists? If so, the percentage of female legislators will most certainly fall in 2017.5) What is Ecuador’s ‘muerte cruzada,’ and how might this affect stability?Correa boasted a majority government for a large chunk of his presidency, the first president to do so since Ecuador’s return to democracy in 1979. Dogged by corruption allegations surrounding the government, AP isn’t likely to earn a majority in the next National Assembly. With their weak organization and national penetration, the opposition parties are even less likely to do so.This matters a great deal to Ecuador’s political stability. Under a weaker government, the muerte cruzada (“mutual death”) provision in Article 148 of the 2008 constitution gives the president the option to dissolve the National Assembly — and simultaneously cut short his own term. The government would then call for new legislative and presidential elections, with the incumbent allowed to govern by decree on urgent economic matters in the interim.Muerte cruzada was never a legitimate threat in the latter years of Correa’s presidency. However, this constitutional feature dramatically increases the risks that a divided or minority government might end in deadlock and dissolution.This could lead to frequent elections and changes of government, as in the decade from 1996 to 2006, when no elected Ecuadorian president served out a full term. It could also increase the temptation for presidents to dissolve parliament so that they can govern unilaterally during the undefined interim period before new elections can be held.Rafael Correa has dominated Ecuador’s politics since 2007 through good politicking, populist policymaking and closing channels of dissent, as well as a political context he helped shape with a new constitution. While Ecuador has made great strides in women’s representation and enjoyed a decade of political stability, Sunday’s election may mark a step backward.

       "6473  The news that Canada’s Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has named a gender-balanced cabinet — and one that is more representative along other dimensions, including religion and ability — is refreshing. (The cabinet of his predecessor, Steven Harper, included six women among its 26 members in 2006).Even more encouraging than Trudeau’s leadership on this issue — and his lack of excuses — is his apparent understanding of the need to address inequality. When asked why he named a government comprised of 50 percent women, he said simply, “Because it’s 2015.” As succinct as his response was, it reflects much greater clarity about the problem of inequality — and its solution — than much public discussion on the issue.Scholars who study politics and gender reject conventional wisdom that women’s marginalization from leadership is due to poorer performance or lesser qualifications (women now outnumber men in advanced degrees in the United States, as in conservative Islamic countries), arguing instead that it reflects unfair recruitment practices. In addition to gender-based biases, inequality can also arise from basic social practices, including the tendency to socialize with others of the same gender. Men simply know fewer women and often prefer to work with other males. This observation helps expose the fallacy that gender equality will be easily achieved without institutional solutions like quotas.Unfortunately, debates about gender have also figured prominently in the U.S. presidential primary races, and in troubling ways. Despite the presence of female candidates Hillary Clinton and Carly Fiorina, public debate on and media coverage of the issue are often devoid of an understanding of the mechanisms that create and perpetuate inequality.In a recent article in Governance — currently ungated — I write about issues of women’s access to government resources and the role that often overlooked structural factors play in contributing to this problem. Although my research takes place in two authoritarian countries in North Africa, it highlights why subtle social dynamics can perpetuate women and other minorities’ lack of access to political power, even when social stereotypes and sexism are diminishing in society in general.Drawing on an original survey of 200 Moroccan and Algerian parliamentarians and field research conducted 2006-2007, I investigate the link between parliamentarian gender, quotas, and service provision to women. A form of constituency service, parliamentary clientelism refers to providing help with personal and community problems, including medical services, judicial or bureaucratic corruption, jobs, money or grants, or electricity. Due to high levels of corruption and economic difficulties in many non-democratic settings, elected officials often spend much of their time trying to help citizens with these issues. Yet I find that women are relatively excluded from these informal service networks with parliamentarians, due in part to structural factors. On average, 20-29 percent of requests that Moroccan and Algerian parliamentarians receive are from women. The effects of gender quotas are striking. While electing women increases service responsiveness to females, parliamentarians elected through quotas experience mandates to help women and are more responsive to females than members of either sex elected without quotas.To explain gender gaps in clientelistic services — and to think about why progress toward gender parity in United States and many other relatively egalitarian societies has stalled — I extend Elin Bjarnegård’s (2013) theory of homosocial capital, which she developed to explain male dominance in Thai parliamentary politics. Homosociality refers to friendships, collaborations and other non-romantic relationships with others of the same gender. Bjarnegård argues that, as long as males are numerically dominant in positions of power, they will continue to enjoy advantages accumulating homosocial capital — predictable relationships with individuals who are similar and have resources needed to win elections.According to Bjarnegård, homosocial capital is composed of instrumental and expressive resources. Expressive resources are dispositional similarities which facilitate close, predictable relationships and access to instrumental resources needed to succeed in campaigns.Men and women often prefer friendship and work collaboration with others of the same gender, due to greater ease relating (e.g., similar behavior and interests, fewer conflicts and sexual harassment concerns, higher trust). Male dominance is reproduced because instrumental and expressive resources are seldom in opposition for men. Males have more instrumental resources and can rely on homosocial linkages. In contrast, women must foster heterosocial networks to obtain resources, while enjoying less expressive resources, such as trust and familiarity, in networks with men.I extend Bjarnegård’s theory of homosocial capital accumulation by incorporating structural and normative aspects of patriarchy into the framework and identifying two gender gaps: in parliamentarians’ supply of and citizens’ demand for services. Patriarchal structures are formal laws and policies such as personal status (e.g., marriage, divorce, inheritance, mobility) and employment laws (e.g., wage discrimination, sex segregation) which give males more instrumental resources and reproduce stereotypes about women’s traits and abilities (i.e., what women are like and can do), including their ability to provide wasta (use of a connection to gets things one needs). Patriarchal norms and attitudes are traditional views of gender roles which identify public space as male, discourage mixing of unrelated males and females, and justify gender discrimination (i.e., what women should do).Exclusion of women from service provision occurs through mutually-reinforcing structural and dispositional factors operating on the supply and demand-side of exchanges. On the instrumental, supply-side, patriarchal structures limit female deputies’ instrumental resources needed to provide services. Because female leaders enjoy fewer patronage networks, women are less likely to be seen as good wastas and are less able to run and succeed in elections (see Table 1).In Tunisia, 19.1 percent saw male deputies as better service providers, compared to 6.9 percent who saw women as better (73.9 percent believed there was no difference), according to a 2014 Transitional Governance Project survey of 1200 Tunisians conducted by United Nations Democracy Fund and Centre d’Études Maghrébines à Tunis, in collaboration with Lindsay Benstead, Ellen Lust, Dhafer Malouche and JMW Consulting.In Jordan, 45.4 percent saw males as better, compared to 13.5 percent females (41.1 percent, no difference), according to a 2014 Program on Governance and Local Development poll conducted among 1,488 Jordanians by Lindsay Benstead, Kristen Kao and Ellen Lust.In Libya, 28.2 percent believed a man would be more effective, compared to 10.9 percent women (60.9 percent, no difference), according to a 2013 National Democratic Institute poll of 1200 Libyans conducted by Diwan Research and the Transitional Governance Project, in collaboration with Lindsay Benstead, Ellen Lust, and JMW Consulting.Table 1. Mechanisms of exclusion from service provisionOn the instrumental, demand side, patriarchal structures exclude women from public space (e.g., employment, politics), giving them fewer resources and influence. Women are less likely to be civically engaged or lead civil society groups, Sufi brotherhoods, and tribes — groups which are critical for winning semi-competitive elections.The Transitional Governance Project found voting in first post-uprisings parliamentary elections was 77 percent for Egyptian men, 58 percent for women; 75 percent for Tunisian men, 65 percent for women; and, 84 percent for Libyan men, 59 percent for women.

       "6478  Kim Yi Dionne: This post is the second in a three-part series on gender and politics focused on political leadership. The series highlights recent political science scholarship that examines experiences from around the world. An earlier post by Farida Jalalzai discussed global trends of women achieving executive office and a forthcoming post by Jana Morgan will discuss women’s leadership in Latin America. Today’s post is a contribution from Leonardo Arriola, Associate Professor of Political Science at UC Berkeley and Martha Johnson, Assistant Professor of Political Science at Mills College. Arriola and Johnson share insights from their recently published article in the American Journal of Political Science: “Ethnic Politics and Women’s Empowerment in Africa: Ministerial Appointments to Executive Cabinets.”****Women in African countries have considerably expanded their participation in political power over the past three decades. Current presidents like Joyce Banda of Malawi, Ellen Johnson Sirleaf of Liberia, and Catherine Samba-Panza of Central African Republic offer visible proof of women’s increasing presence in African executive authority. The emergence of these women leaders reflects a broader regional trend. Since 1980, the proportion of women appointed as cabinet ministers in African countries has increased from 4 percent to 20 percent, placing the region second in the world just behind the Americas and ahead of Europe. Whereas only one-third of African countries had a woman cabinet minister in 1980, today women are included in the cabinet of every African country. But the growth of women in African governance has not necessarily translated into real influence. Previous scholarship has shown that women around the world typically receive appointments to less prestigious, more “feminine,” ministerial portfolios like women’s affairs, which are rarely launching pads for greater authority. This remains true in much of Africa. Based on data from 43 African countries between 1980 and 2005, we find that women are significantly less likely than men to receive high prestige appointments in areas such as finance or defense. Women are more likely to be found in medium prestige portfolios like education, which may have sizable personnel and resources but little influence, or low prestige portfolios like culture with small budgets and narrow constituencies.Prevailing cabinet appointment patterns among African governments have tended to limit the influence of women in high politics. Women are more likely than men to get stuck in less prestigious cabinet positions. As Figure 1 illustrates, men and women have contrasting tenure patterns: men spend more time in more powerful positions whereas women spend more time in less powerful positions. This is problematic because appointments to low prestige portfolios are cabinet dead-ends for most politicians, since they are typically shuffled out of the government without being elevated to more powerful positions. This is especially true for women: while 12.06 percent of men who start in low or medium prestige portfolios are promoted to high prestige portfolios, only 5.74 percent of women have experienced similar promotions.Despite their growing numbers in African governments, women continue to have limited policy influence because they tend to be concentrated in a single area of government. Figure 2 shows the functional classification of 9,824 portfolio appointments held by men and women across 43 African countries between 1980 and 2005. Whereas men tend to be broadly distributed across functional areas, more than half of all women (53.95 percent) are appointed to portfolios that concern government’s social welfare functions in areas like education, family affairs, community development, and culture. Only one-fifth of men (20.82 percent) are appointed to such portfolios. These proportions nearly flip among portfolios that oversee economic functions such as agriculture, lands, and public works with only 22.87 percent of women receiving such appointments versus 43.09 percent of men. Why do women continue to be appointed to less influential positions in African governments? Previous studies of government formation in advanced democracies suggest that women tend to lose out on powerful portfolios where such appointments are used to forge coalitions among party leaders, who are primarily men. We believe a similar dynamic holds in African countries. Despite the ongoing process of democratization, incumbent presidents use high prestige appointments to win the support of influential politicians who, because of their sizable ethnic or regional constituencies, can potentially pose a threat to the executive’s continued hold on power. Women are rarely in such positions in African countries.African leaders may instead appoint women to their cabinets to signal their intent to deliver on campaign promises. Ongoing democratization has created greater pressure for the region’s governments to deliver on reform and improved governance. Some leaders have responded by appointing women to their cabinets with reputations built through work in activist movements, professional associations, and non-governmental organizations. For example, in Uganda, women’s rights activist Miria Matembe, an outspoken critic of corruption, was appointed to lead the Ministry for Ethics and Integrity. In this respect, the entry of women policy advocates in African governments conforms to a broader cross-national pattern in which women with policy or professional expertise are more likely to be appointed to the cabinet.African women’s executive influence will ultimately depend on the emergence of women who possess both the political capital to negotiate high prestige appointments and exceptional qualifications in related policy areas. Although existing patronage channels connected to state agencies and ruling parties remain dominated by men, growing opportunities in the private sector and international organizations may enable women to acquire expertise and influence in a wide range of policy areas, making them attractive candidates for the highest levels of government. In Nigeria, for example, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, was twice appointed finance minister after having gaining experience as an economist and vice-president working for the World Bank. Her path, like that of Africa’s three women presidents and the other women ministers we have studied, demonstrates that African women are using professional training, career excellence, and outspoken activism to make ever larger cracks in the glass ceilings of executive power. In the process, many women ministers are pushing for a new model of African governance, one that is more professional, transparent, and responsive to women’s needs and concerns.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",
       "7047  The United States has plummeted to 28th place on an annual ranking of the world's most equal countries for men and women, falling behind Rwanda, an East African country ravaged by genocide in 1994.Rwandan women beat American women in both labor force participation and government representation, according to the World Economic Forum’s Global Gender Gap Report. Eighty-eight percent of women in Rwanda have jobs, compared to 66 percent of women in the U.S. A whopping 64 percent of the African nation’s politicians are women, compared to our 19 percent.It's important to note that Rwanda, which placed sixth on the list, also boasts more gender equality than France (15th), Spain (25th), Germany (11th), Switzerland (8th) and Denmark (14th). Each country was graded on labor participation, health, political empowerment and educational attainment.So, how did Rwanda blaze past much of the Western world in women’s economic and political opportunity? The answer lies in recent history.The Rwandan genocide, a mass slaughter of the Tutsi minority population, tore apart families and killed roughly 800,000 adults and children in 100 days. Hutu extremists destroyed communities, raping an estimated 500,000 women.After the tragedy ended in July 1994, women banded together and demanded power. They changed the country’s constitution to require that women hold at least 30 percent of top political roles. They called for true equality in marriage. They took over farms. They delayed starting families to work and earn more.In a story for The Guardian last year, reporter Alexandra Topping, who visited Kigali, the country’s capital, wrote: “A swath of laws have given women the right to inherit land, share the assets of a marriage and obtain credit. As many girls as boys receive primary and secondary education, maternal mortality is lower and the birth rate is falling.”Things, of course, aren’t perfect. Topping notes that domestic violence still plagues households, despite public campaigns to stop it. And average lifespans in Rwanda remain low, the WEF report highlighted: 57 years old for women and 55 for men.The U.S., meanwhile, plunged eight slots on the gender equality ranking this year, slipping out of the report’s top 20. The wage gap and fewer women in senior government positions appear to have propelled the drop.Beyond discrimination, economists say both issues are exacerbated by America's lack of family-friendly policies, the soaring cost of child care and the cultural expectation that women, even sole breadwinners, should shoulder the bulk of domestic responsibilities. A recent Pew survey of more than 1,800 U.S. parents found both men and women have trouble balancing job responsibilities with family life. Mothers, however, reported tackling more chores than fathers, regardless of who earned more money: Sixty-four percent of female respondents said the majority of household work fell to them.American women also experienced an uneven recovery since the last economic downtown, which dragged down their labor force participation.About 8.7 million jobs disappeared during the last recession. American men have encountered less trouble getting back to work, according to the Economic Policy Institute. Between February 2010 and June 2014, they gained 5.5 million jobs, while women gained 3.6 million.Related:How American women fell behind Japanese women in the workplaceBoston is offering free salary negotiation workshops to every woman who works in the city                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     "
