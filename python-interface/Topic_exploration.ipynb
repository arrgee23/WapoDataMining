       "      <td>The European Space Agency just secured 436 million euros to send its first-ever rover to Mars in 2020.The news came as a relief to scientists behind the two-part ExoMars mission, who are still reeling after their spacecraft Schiaparelli crashed in an attempt to land on the Red Planet during the first part of the mission.But a proposal to survey a near-Earth asteroid — and eventually attempt to knock it off course — was not so lucky.Last month, more than 100 planetary scientists, engineers and physicists had signed an open letter in support of NASA and ESA's Asteroid Impact and Deflection Assessment mission, warning that humanity really needs to figure out whether we can deflect a killer asteroid before it crashes into Earth. But ESA Director General Jan Woerner said that the ESA part of the program didn't get enough backing or funding to ensure its future, although the space agency will continue to study asteroid defense in other ways.“These asteroid activities, looking at how we can really defend our planet in case something is happening and Bruce Willis is not ready to do it a second time .?.?. will be continued,” he joked to Reuters, referencing the 1998 movie “Armageddon,” in which Willis plays a driller who must save Earth from an asteroid capable of causing a mass extinction.The decision makes it even less likely that NASA will pursue its half of the mission, which would have sent a spacecraft slamming into the asteroid as ESA satellites observed the maneuver.The funding decisions came out of a two-day meeting of government ministers in Lucerne, Switzerland. Europe approved an extra 339 million euros for the ExoMars rover, and ESA said it could cobble together an additional 97 million euros by reshuffling funds internally, according to Nature.“After the many challenging, difficult and rewarding moments of 2016, this is a great relief and a fine result for European space exploration,” Don McCoy, ESA’s project manager for ExoMars, told Nature.The first half of the mission, which is a joint project of ESA and the Russian Federal Space Agency, arrived at Mars this October. It included the Trace Gas Orbiter, which will circle above the planet sniffing for gases that could be signs of habitability or even life, and the Schiaparelli lander. The latter spacecraft was primarily designed to test the technologies needed for landing — and it failed.An ESA investigation revealed that the lander misinterpreted sensor data during its descent, so it thought it was below ground level rather than two miles above it. Schiaparelli jettisoned its parachute, turned off its thrusters too early and went into a free fall before coming to a crashing halt on the Martian surface.[The Schiaparelli crash shows how difficult it is to land on Mars]It was a sadly familiar scenario. Roughly half of all Mars missions fail, and ESA had already lost one lander to the deadly descent to the surface. Prospects for the rover mission, which is already over budget and delayed from its original launch date in 2018, looked uncertain after the Schiaparelli crash.“Completion of ExoMars was probably the most challenging of our discussions because of the size of the additional resources that have been put on the table,” Roberto Battiston, president of the Italian Space Agency, told the BBC.But European ministers decided to commit to the project anyway. Engineers say they learned important lessons from the crash that will help the 2020 robot land safely on the Red Planet, where it will drill beneath the surface in search of microbes that might survive beyond the reach of deadly radiation.The ESA also committed to participating in the International Space Station until at least 2024.Read more:Elon Musk unveils Mars colonization plan, but don't pack your bags just yetNASA's Juno spacecraft may have a malfunctioning engineDear Science: How did the planets get their names?That study critiquing NASA’s ‘bad science’ on asteroids is pretty bad science</td>\n",

       "      <td>The Toyota sedan cruising last week down a leafy suburban parkway was like any family car on the road, save for one key detail: Its power was coming not from gasoline but hydrogen, stored in tanks beneath the seats.The first mass-market car to run off hydrogen, the $57,500 Mirai, has quickly become a powerful force in the battle for tomorrow’s roads. The four-seater can drive farther and refuel faster than any electric car a driver can buy.But the world’s biggest car company, even before the Mirai’s first California sale in October, is placing a massively risky bet on hydrogen, now sold at only a dozen American fueling stations. For many, it still evokesthe Hindenburg and the hydrogen bomb.The type of hydrogen fuel cells that run the Mirai have been repeatedly tried and abandoned by rival automakers, and electric-car pioneers have panned the technology as unrealistic and doomed to fail.“If you’re going to pick an energy source mechanism, hydrogen is an incredibly dumb one to pick,” Elon Musk, founder of Tesla, Toyota’s chief rival in the electric-car market, said in January. “It doesn’t make sense, and that will become apparent in the next few years.”Think of the Mirai as a small power plant on wheels. Instead of drawing energy from a battery, like the Nissan Leaf and Chevrolet Volt, the all-electric Mirai makes its own, by gulping in air and mixing it with hydrogen in a stack of fuel cells. The reaction cleanly powers the motor and belches out no exhaust, save for a thin trickle of water.Boosters of zero-emission vehicles have praised the Mirai — whose name in Japanese means “future” — as a solution to some of electric cars’ thorniest problems. The sedan can drive 300 miles on a full tank and be refueled in about five minutes — instead of needing to be plugged in overnight — making it an easier fit for the typical commute.Toyota has a track record for this sort of disruption, having built the first mass-produced hybrid, the Prius, from an experimental laughingstock into a clean and unexciting mainstream sedan. While still a niche — hybrids make up only 3 percent of American car sales — the Prius became emblematic of a way normal drivers could help save the world without trying too hard.“Toyota is so big that it can still be a science experiment for them,” said David Whiston, an equity strategist with investment researcher Morningstar. “If it doesn’t work out, they can go back to selling Priuses and all the other gas guzzlers no one ever talks about.”Yet these are very different roads than the ones the Prius first rolled onto 18 years ago. When drivers first bought the hybrid, they already had ways to fuel it — and no easier alternative if they wanted a greener drive.Today, the Mirai faces competition not just from electric vehicles but from traditional gas guzzlers, which because of tougher federal emissions standards drive more efficiently than ever. Traditional vehicles are also far cheaper: Though Toyota is pledging three years of free hydrogen and more than $5,000 in federal and state incentives could bring down the cost, the Mirai is about twice as pricey as the average mid-size sedan.Musk, whose company makes the electric flagship Model S, has become one of fuel cells’ most vocal critics, calling them “extremely silly” “fool cells” that siphon money and attention from the efficient battery systems that run most electric cars, including his.Nissan boss Carlos Ghosn has slammed the idea that a country as vast as the United States could efficiently build a network of hydrogen stations nearly from scratch. For Toyota, it could become a globe-spanning chicken-or-egg problem: That there are few hydrogen stations could lead to fewer drivers — and fewer of the customers those stations need to survive.Toyota, the $236 billion Japanese juggernaut, is starting small, with plans to make available only 3,000 Mirais in the United States by 2017, a sum close to the number of Ford F-150 trucks sold in a day.Most of those cars will cruise solely in California, home to 10 of the country’s 12 hydrogen refueling stations. Though other hydrogen fueling centers operate in Connecticut and South Carolina and more are in development, building or outfitting a station to supply the universe’s lightest element can cost $1 million or more.That slow start and scant infrastructure could limit how much hydrogen power can accomplish. In a report last year to investors, Citi Research analysts said they expect fuel-cell cars such as the Mirai to “have little impact on the auto market” until at least 2020.Environmental advocates have also questioned just how eco-friendly the Mirai can be. Hydrogen today is mostly produced from natural gas, a fossil fuel, and must be trucked to stations via tankers, unaided by the kind of nationwide grid that fuels battery-powered cars.Energy experts say hydrogen, over time, will increasingly come from clean renewable sources such as wind and solar. The Mirai, Toyota executives argue, is only the first step of a energy evolution that one said was the carmaker’s vision for “the next 100 years.”But the company is already pushing back on early skepticism, launching a “Fueled by Bulls--t” ad campaign named for one of Musk’s critiques to explain how hydrogen can be sourced from cow manure.The carmaker has also attempted to swat back safety concerns. Hydrogen is odorless and flammable but no more dangerous than gasoline and disperses quickly in case of leaks, company officials say. (To guard against those, engineers have gone so far as to fire high-caliber rounds to test the Mirai’s bulletproof hydrogen tanks.)The automaker has also taken to touting the Mirai’s versatility beyond the road. A plug in the trunk can turn the car into a mobile generator, the company says, delivering enough juice to power the average American home’s essentials for a week.Even in the small-batch world of environmentally friendly automaking, the Mirai’s production is an oddity, pieced together without use of a robot or conveyor belt in Toyota’s sprawling Motomachi plant in Japan. A dozen specialized workers in blue hard hats assemble the car by hand, turning out about three a day.Though no other automaker has pushed to mass-produce hydrogen cars, the Mirai is far from the first car to embark on the path to alternative power. Hydrogen-powered cars, such as the Hyundai Tucson, have gained loyal if microscopic followings in California. Honda, which recently retired its small line of FCX Clarity fuel-cell cars, said it plans to sell a space-age upgrade of the car, the FCV, sometime next spring.Toyota’s hydrogen crusade has gained a spirited boost in its home country of Japan, which plans to install fuel-cell stacks in more than 5 million homes over the next 15 years. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe became the first to own a Mirai, in December, and he recently celebrated the opening of Tokyo’s first hydrogen station as “the dawn of a true hydrogen society.”But this new age will require heavy government investment at levels American policymakers and taxpayers might be less excited about. Japan is now offering subsidies of 3 million yen, or about $25,000, to buyers of fuel-cell vehicles in Tokyo, which has pledged $375 million worth of hydrogen-related development before the city’s 2020 Olympics.Like the Prius, the Mirai could be what industry insiders call a “halo car,” a flagship meant to boost Toyota’s eco-friendly image rather than drive sales. That, skeptics say, would make Toyota’s boasting of a “hydrogen era” and the evolution of the Mirai more a marketing tactic than revolutionary act.But in the end, the trickiest obstacle for advanced fuel-cell cars might prove to be a simple one: price. At its cheapest, the Mirai can be leased for $499 a month, three times the cost of a new Corolla set to sip historically cheap gas.To succeed, Toyota will need to get “some people on board and willing to spend $50,000 on a compact car,” said Whiston, the Morningstar equity strategist. “Much li</td>\n",

       "      <td>CARACAS, Venezuela — It’s become a well-worn routine here: A news flash about President Hugo Chavez’s battle with cancer is issued, invariably delivered with great fanfare but scant details.But what is increasingly troubling Venezuelans is not just the lack of candor that envelops the president’s condition, but that the news just as often comes from Cuba as it does from government ministries in Caracas. To protest what they call Cuban meddling, university students have chained themselves together in front of the Cuban embassy, and a growing chorus of opposition leaders charge that the Cuban government is calling the shots when it comes to Chavez’s health care.Amid rising tensions over the state’s secrecy, the government issued pictures of Chavez last week, the first time he had been seen publicly in 67 days. In the photos, Chavez is smiling and holding up a copy of Cuba’s state newspaper, Granma, from a hospital bed in Cuba.And just a few days before, revolutionary icon Fidel Castro — whom Chavez has called a father figure and a saint — offered more details than Venezuelan officials had by reporting that he received updates on the Venezuelan leader’s health “every day” and that Cuba’s most famous patient “is recovering.”“Ironically, Fidel Castro knows more about our president than the Venezuelans do,” quipped Federica Romer, 19, a university student who has been among those protesting outside the embassy.For some here, it is a sign that the small, poor island nation has an outsized role in Venezuelan affairs. It’s a role that seems to have grown since June 2011, when Chavez, speaking on national television from Havana, first revealed that he had undergone surgery on the island to remove a tumor.“I have to tell you that my indignation grows every day,” said Adicea Castillo, 75, an economist who helped topple Venezuela’s last dictatorship in 1958 and said she was once supportive of Fidel Castro. “It’s outrageous to see a government and a president so beholden in this way to Cuba.”Drawing closer togetherCuba’s influence on Venezuela is well known here. Over Chavez’s 14 years in power, Cuba has sent sports trainers and doctors to Venezuela’s poor barrios and provided intelligence agents to this country’s military. Venezuela has reciprocated with 100,000 barrels of oil a day at cut-rate prices, an economic lifeline that analysts say has helped keep the Castro regime afloat.Chavez’s government has also worked tirelessly for Cuba to be accepted by other Latin American countries, an effort that paid off last month when President Raul Castro assumed the presidency of a 14-month-old regional bloc called the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States.But Chavez’s cancer has drawn the two countries even closer, with the president spending more and more time in Havana as doctors grapple with a tumor that appears to have fended off four surgeries, chemotherapy and radiation treatments.Indeed, Chavez was last seen in Venezuela on Dec. 10, when he boarded an early-morning flight to Havana. He missed his Jan. 10 swearing-in for a fourth term and, until photographs of him were released Friday, no one aside from a small cabal of aides and family members knew for sure whether he was even alive.What Venezuelans do know is that the country’s top leaders have taken to flying constantly to Cuba to meet with Chavez. Those associates say Chavez has provided them with detailed instructions on running the state.But critics say that Chavez has been in no condition to govern and that Cuba’s government is helping plot Venezuela’s course.“What’s happening in Venezuela has no precedent in our history,” said Maria Corina Machado, an outspoken anti-Chavez lawmaker. “For the first time in 200 years of republican history, the decisions regarding the destiny of our country are being taken abroad.”Such accusations have angered Venezuelan officials, who call the relationship with Cuba “a brotherhood” based on mutual respect.But the government’s annoyance at the criticism has done little to curb growing resentment among some Venezuelans.‘A great uncertainty’In recent days, university students have chained themselves outside the Cuban embassy, which has drawn other protesters angry about Chavez’s long sojourn in Havana. With a phalanx of National Guard troops protecting the embassy, the students have been sleeping on cushions and blankets in the middle of the street.They say they won’t leave until they have clear answers about the president’s health.For the protesters, the photographs issued by Chavez’s aides proved nothing. They noted that the government still has not said what kind of cancer Chavez has nor revealed details about his prognosis or whether he will even return to Caracas.“We Venezuelans are living a great uncertainty, really, because we don’t know the truth,” said Gustavo Frias, 23, who spent the weekend at the embassy with other students. “We don’t know how the president is, if he’s fine, if he’s alive, if he’s dead. The truth is what we want to know.”Emilia Diaz-Struck contributed to this report.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Polish baroque painter Krzysztof Lubieniecki finished “Portrait of a Young Man” sometime around 1728, and the work of art eventually made its way to Poland’s National Museum in Warsaw.Then, like thousands of other European artworks, the painting fell into Nazi hands during World War II. For many years the Lubieniecki painting existed only on lists documenting looted art, accompanied by a black-and-white photo to prove its existence.Now, decades after its theft, “Portrait of a Young Man” is back with Polish officials, the FBI announced Monday.Where had the painting been all this time? Mostly in Ohio, according to authorities, and some serendipitous research helped unearth it.[Why two American museums are fighting to keep art stolen by the Nazis]The Lubieniecki painting has long been thought to have been one of many that the Nazis stole from the Warsaw museum in October 1944 and took to an Austrian palace, the FBI said in a statement. That palace, identified by the Polish embassy as Fischhorn Castle, eventually came to house an Allied Forces battalion.A small chapel in the castle was “filled with works of art that had been stolen by the Nazis and used as a depository,” according to the Monuments Men Foundation, which honors service members tasked with protecting art and architecture in war-ravaged Europe.“‘The Portrait of a Young Man’ was apparently later discovered by a U.S. serviceman while in Austria,” the FBI said in a statement. “The soldier is believed to have brought the artwork to the United States after his service abroad.”[Art looted by the Nazis could be hiding in plain sight on the walls of Europe’s great museums]The solider died and the painting was sold to “innocent purchasers” throughout the Columbus, Ohio area, according to the FBI. And there it remained, in Ohio, for many years.But recently a relative of the U.S. solider came across photos of the artwork while conducting some family research. More research revealed that the painting, once housed in the Warsaw museum, had likely been taken by the Nazis.The soldier’s relative reached out to Polish authorities and “upon learning of the historic rights of the painting, the possessors agreed to return the work to Poland,” the FBI said.Officials held a repatriation ceremony in the FBI’s Columbus office.“We are honored to return this painting to the Polish government and the National Museum,” Special Agent in Charge Angela Byers said in a statement. “This was truly a cooperative effort among the U.S. government and our international partners to ensure this work of art was returned to its homeland.”[A frenzy in Poland over the latest mysterious ‘Nazi gold train’]Poland’s Ministry of Culture and National Heritage has a database of more than 63,000 objects lost during WWII. “Several dozen works of art” have been recovered so far, according to the Polish embassy.Last year, U.S. federal officials returned to Poland “St. Philip baptizing a servant of Queen Kandaki” by German artist Johann Conrad Seekatz. “Stolen art, antiquities, and fraudulently-acquired artifacts, these are the little known casualties of war,” U.S. Special Agent in Charge of Homeland Security Investigations James Hayes said at the time.“We treat every painting, every sculpture, every historical artifact with utmost importance — they are the missing pieces of a puzzle that make up the Polish national heritage,” then-Polish minister of culture and heritage Bogdan Zdrojewski said in 2014.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Cultural concepts are always fuzzy, but that doesn’t make them useless. We may never know the exact beginning or end of Romanticism or the Gilded Age, or where lies the line between art and entertainment, or what distinguishes great talent from genius. But that doesn’t make those concepts hollow, just fluid and approximate.A new entertaining and insightful exhibition at the Smithsonian’s National Portrait Gallery confronts one of the most dynamic and hard to define concepts in American cultural life — the cool. “American Cool” broaches its subject through photographs of people who helped define and embody the cool since before the idea had even taken definite form, to the current day when it is highly questionable if the “cool” is still meaningful. If you want to know how porous the category is, consider all of the following, officially inducted into the realms of the cool by this exhibition: Walt Whitman, Frederick Douglass, H.L. Mencken, Buster Keaton, Jackson Pollock and Susan Sontag. They join artists, entertainers and celebrities who are more traditionally and obviously defined as cool: Lester Young (who plays the central historical role in defining and promoting the idea of cool), Humphrey Bogart (the first and greatest mass-market embodiment of the cool) and Jack Kerouac (who helped export the cool from jazz to broader countercultural application).To govern what seems at first like a highly subjective free-for-all, curators Joel Dinerstein and Frank H. Goodyear III laid down a four-part test for each of the 100 people included. First, they must have made an original artistic contribution, with a signature style; second, they must have in some way been rebellious or transgressive; third, they must have iconic status; and fourth, they must have left a significant cultural legacy. But even those parameters can’t contain the many things we think are definitional about the cool, the aura of mystery, the stoical indifference to criticism, the attitude of self- possession, and seemingly superficial yet important questions of dress and personal style. In a catalog essay accompanying the exhibition, Dinerstein piles on with yet more things that are the opposite of cool: “To be cool is not to be nice or good or heroic; cool is the opposite of innocence or virtue. Cool has an edge and a dark side: to be cool is not to strive to be fabulous .?.?. or saintly.”Dinerstein is, among other things, a scholar of jazz, and Goodyear has a degree in American studies, and so they present the cool as essentially a pop culture phenomenon, and distinctly American. Other cultures have similar ideas — nonchalance, sangfroid, sprezzatura — but they are not “cool.” Sprezzatura dates back to Castiglione’s “Book of the Courtier,” which prized a seemingly effortless virtuosity in all things, from art to social behavior. Sangfroid is distinctly French, a sense of composure and equilibrium, especially under fire.These are, according to the curators, concepts derived from aristocratic entitlement, whereas American cool is generally working class, an “earned individuality” rather than an inherited sense of self-worth. Perhaps, though the aristocratic definition of these ideas was breaking down around the same time that this exhibition posits the origins of the cool. Walt Whitman — the first personality featured in the exhibition, which calls him “the guiding light of American bohemia” — published “Leaves of Grass” in 1855; in 1844, Alexandre Dumas began serializing “The Count of Monte Cristo,” in which a self-made working-class young man assumes an aristocratic name and character to exact revenge on his enemies. Few characters in literature are more suave, self-possessed, disciplined, eccentric and alluring — in a word, cool. And none of that was technically inherited.But the authors have a point. In America, at least, cool is distinctly lower or middle class, reflecting its origins in African American culture, where it was a compensation mechanism for living under the brutal regime of racism. When Lester Young said “I’m cool,” writes Dinerstein, “it meant ‘I’m keeping it together in here against invasive social forces.’” Frederick Douglass, whose oratory was fiery, not cool, merits inclusion in the exhibition because, according to Goodyear, he used a carefully constructed photographic identity to challenge preconceptions about race and African American men. “Though he lived prior to cool’s popularization, his cultivation of this mask of stylish stoicism presaged the rebellions of others who sought to live within yet also apart from the mainstream.”Stylish stoicism is an excellent phrase. But as the exhibition charts the historical evolution of the cool, “stylish stoicism” fits less well with the later, countercultural appropriation of the cool. Transgression becomes more important than style and talent, even directionless, purposeless, self-destructive transgression. When Marlon Brando’s character in the 1953 film “The Wild One” is asked “Hey, Johnny, what are you rebelling against?” and he answers, “Whaddaya got?” — the cool has clearly gone through a critical permutation. Brando is, of course, featured in the exhibition, looking sad, innocent and distracted in a 1950 image by Philippe Halsman.The exhibition situates this evolution of the cool in the period from 1960 t0 1979, but it was clearly nascent earlier than that. “Cool &amp; Counterculture: 1960-1979” is one of the most fascinating and provocative stretches of the show, including diverse figures from Andy Warhol and Paul Newman to Jack Nicholson and Bill Murray. One particularly evocative juxtaposition places a reprint of a 1966 photograph of Muhammad Ali with his fist thrust directly into the camera lens next to a 1971 image of Clint Eastwood, holding an enormous handgun in a visually analogous confrontation with the viewer. Clearly the concept has become elastic if it can encompass a black boxer playfully enacting an aggressive identity and a white actor appealing to working class (and often racist) fantasies of public order and vigilantism.The exhibition ends with what it calls “The Legacies of Cool: 1980-present.” Here we find David Byrne (definitely cool), Steve Jobs (geek cool), Willie Nelson (long-haired, hippie stoner cool) and Jon Stewart (really?). Perhaps the most telling image is a photograph of skateboarder Tony Hawk, doing a move in his kitchen. His young son sits at the kitchen counter while his wife cradles a baby. The dishwasher is open, there are decorative plates above the standard-issue wooden cupboards and the whole thing screams suburbia. The wall text notes his success as an entrepreneur, with a popular line of sports equipment and a video game series. In an interview Dinerstein acknowledged that old ideas about transgression may not be so important any more. What matters now is “new strategies for individuality.”The exhibition is heavily focused on celebrity, though there are some surprises (the Hawaiian surfer Duke Paoa Kahanamoku appears in a circa 1915 photograph). But as the concept of the cool becomes more and more open-ended, it’s unfortunate that it isn’t extended further beyond popular music and film. Susan Sontag definitely seems a worthy inclusion, but are there no classical musicians, ballet dancers or post-structuralist philosophers who are cool? Was the great violinist Jascha Heifetz cool? Or just cold? Was the literary theorist Jacques Derrida cool? Or just inscrutable?It’s also unfortunate that the cool isn’t treated more critically as a concept. There is a dark side of cool, dumb, impassive, disengaged, dismissive and even violent (see the oeuvre of Quentin Tarantino). Think of the phrase “too cool for school,” and all that implies. Although “geek” cool makes a brief appearance in the person of Jobs (on a motorcycle), the rise of geeks and nerds as positive cultural archetypes may be a sign of a healthy resistance against the stupid underbelly of cool.

       "      <td>Last week, the Sunrise 689, a Vietnamese oil tanker, disappeared off the radar. This Thursday, it motored toward the Vietnamese coast under protection of a naval vessel. Pirates of unknown nationality had seized the ship Oct. 2 and kept its crew hostage while they siphoned a third of its cargo: some 2,000 metric tons of oil. \"They put knives on our throats and threatened to kill us if we resist,\" the ship's deputy captain told the Associated Press by cellphone. One crew member broke his leg after trying to flee the pirates, reported the AP.Luckily, there were no fatalities. The pirates jumped ship with their stolen booty and the tanker had to enlist the help of a passing fishing vessel to figure out its location and call for help.The incident marked the latest pirate attack near the Malacca Strait, a body of water that links the Indian Ocean and the South China Sea, making it perhaps the world's most vital conduit for global shipping. It carries some 40 percent of world trade through its waters every year. The lands flanking these waters have been contested by local kingdoms and sultanates, Arabs, Chinese, and the forces of European colonial powers. Singapore, one of the world's most important ports, emerged in the 19th century as a pivotal entrepot straddling this passage. It was also, in its early days, a haven for pirates.The attack was the 12th such pirate hijacking attempt in Southeast Asia since April, raising concerns about an escalation in piracy in this strategic waterway. The rise has been conspicuous enough that it initially dominated the fevered speculation surrounding Malaysian Airlines flight 370, when it tragically disappeared earlier this year.From a dip in 71 attacks reported in the Malacca Strait and adjacent South China Sea in 2009, numbers surged back to 161 reported attacks in 2013. This graph from German news site Deutsche Welle lays out the trend over the past two decades.Half a decade ago, as the world fretted over the terrors of Somali piracy, strategists pointed to the relative success of counter-piracy measures in the Malacca Strait as a guide for how to deal with the threat of the Horn of Africa. In a 2011 report, the American Enterprise Institute, a D.C-based conservative think tank, hailed the success of the \"Malaccan formula\":The Strait of Malacca between Indonesia, Malaysia, and Singapore offers some interesting solutions. The “formula” in the Strait of Malacca, as outlined by Lt. Commander Jamiola of the U.S. Navy, consists of state-sponsored naval forces, regional intelligence sharing, surface surveillance radars, an effective court system, and fighting the origins of piracy on land. It has proved extremely successful, with the number of pirate attacks in the region declining each year since 2003.An international task force began patrolling the waters off Somalia's lengthy coastline along a similar model, forcing Somali pirate \"motherships\" further afield from their bases on shore. The number of pirate attacks dried up, with piracy off West Africa's coast now becoming a greater security concern.Piracy monitors caution that the recent spike in attacks near the Malacca Strait involves many \"low-level thefts,\" including raids and burglaries conducted at night when ships are at anchor in port. The growing trend does not necessarily mean there's a greater deterioration and pirate threat in the region. This year alone, the U.S. navy held military exercises with Singapore that focused in part on anti-piracy maneuvers.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Asleep in the mountains northwest of Boulder, Colo., a teenage camp counselor was awakened Sunday morning by a loud crunching sound.The noise was the sound of large teeth scraping against his skull, he told Denver ABC-affiliate KMGH. A black bear, the teen realized, was trying to pull him out of his sleeping bag by his head.“It grabbed me like this and pulled me, and then it bit the back of my head and dragged me,” the teen, identified only by his first name, Dylan, told KMGH. “When it was dragging me, that was the slowest part. It felt like it went forever.”Fellow staffers and campers were roused by the commotion and tried to scare the bear away as Dylan fought back. The bear dragged Dylan about 10 feet, then dropped him and walked away.Dylan was taken to the hospital. His injuries weren’t life threatening. Authorities are searching for the bear, which will likely be euthanized, according to the Associated Press.The teen is a counselor at Glacier View Ranch, a camp owned by the Rocky Mountain Conference of Seventh Day Adventists, the AP reported. According to the camp’s website, the conference hosts seven weeks of summer camps for youth ages 7 to 18. The camps feature zip lines, go-carts and canoeing, “all in a safe, Christ-centered atmosphere.”The ranch confirmed the attack on its website, and said it would not cancel the rest of the summer’s camps. About 100 children and teens are expected to attend.Campers that Dylan was supervising over the weekend had asked if they could spend the night under the stars, sleeping by the camp’s lake. Dylan relented.He told reporters he teaches wilderness survival at the camp.How fortuitous. One of the tips experts recommend for surviving a bear attack is to fight back.Dylan’s experience follows other troubling reports of bear attacks, including two fatal maulings in Alaska a day apart last month.On June 18, Patrick “Jack” Cooper, a 16-year-old from Anchorage, was killed by a bear after he veered off a trail during a mountain foot race south of the city, according to the AP. A day later, Erin Johns, a 27-year-old contract worker for Pogo Mine died in a mauling 275 miles northeast of Anchorage. Her 38-year-old co-worker was also injured.Authorities told the AP they were baffled by the uptick in bear attacks, although the numbers can fluctuate from year to year. Dylan said his experience hasn’t changed his attitude toward bears. In fact, he was back at camp — sporting fresh scars — when he talked to reporters.“I’m not afraid of the bears. I’m not afraid of sleeping outside anymore. You just have to be aware and respect the animals,” Dylan said.Read more: Scientists have identified the 50-foot creature that washed up on an Indonesian beachHe was on his way to meet the mayor.

       "      <td>We all know not to stare at the sun, right? Seems like common sense, but every time an eclipse comes around, a few people invariably try to watch it without special, protective eye wear and end up damaging their eyeballs.Even during August’s solar eclipse, when the moon will travel across the sun and block part of the sunlight, you cannot look directly at the sun without very strong protective eye wear. Not just sunglasses — lenses that were designed specifically to filter out enough of the light that it doesn’t burn a hole through your retinas.If you did try to look at it without your glasses, it would be “like a magnifying glass on a leaf when you were a kid,” an optometrist tweeted at me. That’s what’s illustrated (in graphic detail) in the video at the top of this story.I’m not trying to provoke panic about watching the solar eclipse. Hundreds of thousands — perhaps millions — of people across the United States are going to walk outside Aug. 21, look up, and see something truly spectacular. That’s something I look forward to.But because I’m curious (and quite a few people have asked), I thought it would be interesting to talk about what would happen if you tried to look at the sun during the eclipse. And don’t tell me it doesn’t happen and people know better. That’s not true.According to an expert answer on the University of California at Santa Barbara ScienceLine, ” … doctors collect information after events like the 1999 solar eclipse, when people who stared directly at the sun for several minutes went to see their doctor. In one study, about half had permanent damage.”An assessment after the same eclipse in Britain found fewer cases than they had feared, but 14 people still managed to damage their eyes by staring at the eclipse.There’s even a tale that Isaac Newton stared at the sun with one eye (for the sake of science, of course), and afterward he could only see reds and blues. I have no idea if that is fiction or fact, but it sure makes a good story.Want to watch the eclipse safely? Here’s how it will go …… if you’re in the path of totality:It will start as a partial eclipse as the moon begins to cover the sun. Keep your glasses on at this point.When the sun is totally blocked by the moon, you can take your glasses off! Enjoy. It’s beautiful.Once sunlight starts to appear again, as the moon departs, put your glasses back on and enjoy the partial eclipse.… if you’re not in the path of totality:You’ll only be seeing a partial eclipse. There will be harmful sun rays for the duration of the event. Keep your eclipse glasses on through the whole thing.Yes, you will go blind if you manage to endure the pain and stare at the sun for long enough. The pain from the visible part of the light spectrum could be extreme, but ultraviolet light — which we can’t see — can also damage the eye. It literally gives your eye a sunburn.The reason a few people always end up going blind during an eclipse is that in the partial phase, the visible light is reduced enough that it’s no longer painful or uncomfortable to look at and so people assume it’s safe. But depending on the sky conditions, it only takes about a minute and a half for your eyes to be permanently damaged, and the damage is cumulative, meaning you don’t have to stare at the sun without looking away for it to be harmful — you may just be taking quick glances, but it’s still damaging your eye.If your eyes are damaged, your vision will at least be blurry and you may see dark or yellow spots. If it’s significant damage, you may not be able to see out of the center of your eye — only your peripheral vision.Other things you should be aware of: Some drugs dilate your pupils, which will decrease the amount of time it will take to burn the eye. People taking these drugs should always take care to wear UV-blocking sunglasses. Also, looking through a camera lens or a telescope will not protect your eyes. The latter is blatantly obvious in the video. Unless it has a filter on it that is made specifically for blocking out the harmful rays, you should not look through any lenses.This story has been altered to make it clearer that both visible and U.V. light can damage the eye, albeit different parts of the eye.</td>\n",

       "      <td>BOSTON — Two years after the horrific bombing of this city’s famed marathon, a federal jury on Friday sentenced to death one of the young men responsible for the attack, turning away appeals for mercy from his attorneys and even some victims.The jury of seven women and five men rendered its decision after deliberating for more than 14 hours. As the verdict was read, the bomber, 21-year-old Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, displayed no sign of emotion.The outcome was a victory for prosecutors, who said the former college student worked in tandem with his older brother and carried out the attack in a “heinous, cruel and depraved manner.” Jurors rejected arguments that Tsarnaev had fallen under the sway of his brother, Tamerlan, and was remorseful over the suffering he caused.Tsarnaev will be transferred to a federal prison, where he will remain until he is put to death by lethal injection. His attorneys did not comment after the verdict, but they are expected to appeal the sentence.After the verdict, Karen Brassard, who was wounded in the attack, said there was “nothing happy about having to take someone’s life.” But she called the outcome “a just conclusion.”“Right now, it feels like we can take a breath and breathe again,” she said.Tsarnaev will become the 62nd federal inmate on death row, according to the Death Penalty Information Center. But it has been more than a decade since the federal government executed an inmate, and the Obama administration is reviewing its protocol for carrying out the death penalty after a botched Oklahoma state execution last year.But the Justice Department, under Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr., decided last year to seek the death penalty in Tsarnaev’s case. After Friday’s verdict was read, Holder’s successor, Loretta E. Lynch, issued a statement calling the sentence “the ultimate penalty” and “a fitting punishment for this horrific crime.”Tsarnaev faced the possibility of death on 17 charges and was sentenced to death on six of them.Prosecutors had depicted him as a cold-blooded killer, repeatedly arguing that his placement of explosives near a young child was evidence of his depravity and one of the aggravating factors that supported a death sentence. Eight-year-old Martin Richard was one of three people killed in the April 15, 2013, bombings near the finish line of the Boston Marathon.More than 260 others were injured; 17 of them lost limbs. Tsarnaev was also charged with killing Sean Collier, a police officer employed by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in the aftermath of the attack. Although jurors found Tsarnaev guilty of murdering Collier, they did not sentence him to die on that count, a disappointment for prosecutors and the law enforcement community.Throughout the trial, prosecutors emphasized the scope of the carnage to jurors, outlining the death and destruction in graphic detail.“This is not a day of celebration. It is a day of reflection and healing,” Carmen M. Ortiz, the U.S. attorney for Massachusetts, told reporters after the verdict. “It is time to turn the page.”Prosecutors argued that Tsarnaev and his brother — who died in a shootout with police days after the bombings — were inspired by radical Islam and moved to violence out of a sense of vengeance over the U.S. wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. In the boat where the younger Tsarnaev was eventually captured, authorities found a note: “Stop killing our innocent people and we will stop.”“Those are the words of a terrorist convinced that he has done the right thing,” Assistant U.S. Attorney Steve Mellin told the jury. “He felt justified in killing and maiming and seriously injuring innocent men, women and children.”In April, the jury that sentenced Tsarnaev had found him guilty of all 30 charges he faced in connection with the 2013 bombings, one of the worst terrorist attacks in the United States since the Sept. 11, 2001, hijackings.Although Tsarnaev’s attorneys never contested that he was involved in the bombings, they mounted a vigorous defense during the penalty phase of the trial, seeking to convince jurors that mitigating factors demanded that they spare his life. Central to that argument was the notion that he was naive and impressionable — he was 19 at the time of the attack — and merely following Tamerlan, whom the attorneys depicted as the mastermind of the plot. Defense attorneys also argued that the younger Tsarnaev deeply regretted his actions.The vast majority of the jurors did not accept those arguments. Only two found that he had “expressed sorrow and remorse for what he did and for the suffering he caused,” according to the lengthy verdict form read aloud in court. Only three jurors found that he was under the influence of his brother and would not have committed the crimes but for Tamerlan.Tsarnaev’s legal team included attorneys with deep experience in capital cases. One of them, Judy Clarke, had previously persuaded juries to spare the lives of clients facing the death penalty, including Sept. 11, 2001, conspirator Zacarias Moussaoui.If sentenced to life, Tsarnaev would have been held at a Supermax prison that has been described by a former warden as a “version of hell” and a place that “is not designed for humanity.” His attorneys used such descriptions to argue before the jury that a life sentence would not be a reprieve.Clarke told the jury that a life sentence would allow “for the possibility of redemption and a greater opportunity for healing for everyone involved.”“Mercy’s never earned, it’s bestowed,” she said. “And the law allows you to choose justice and mercy.”Victims of the marathon bombings were divided on the sentence. Although some argued publicly that they believed Tsarnaev deserved the death penalty, others — including the family of the 8-year-old boy — called for his life to be spared. Ortiz said she took their views seriously.For other survivors and relatives of victims, a life sentence would have proved insufficient.Said Michael Ward, a firefighter who was watching the marathon in 2013 and who helped victims after the explosions: “This nothing to celebrate. This is a matter of justice.”Tsarnaev “wanted to go to hell,” he said, “and he’s going to get there early.”Mark Berman and Sari Horwitz in Washington contributed to this report.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Jeffrey P. Bezos, the next owner of The Washington Post, says he doesn’t have all the answers for what’s ailing the newspaper industry or for the financially challenged news organization he is preparing to buy. But he says he’s eager to start asking questions and conducting experiments in the quest for a new “golden era” at The Post.In his first interview since his $250 million purchase of The Post was announced in early August, Bezos said his basic approach to operating the business will be similar to the philosophy that has guided him in building Amazon.com from a start-up in 1995 to an Internet colossus with $61 billion in sales last year.“We’ve had three big ideas at Amazon that we’ve stuck with for 18 years, and they’re the reason we’re successful: Put the customer first. Invent. And be patient,” he said. “If you replace ‘customer’ with ‘reader,’ that approach, that point of view, can be successful at The Post, too.”Bezos, 49, spoke via phone from Seattle on Friday, four days before he was scheduled to visit The Post for the first time since the announcement of its purchase from The Washington Post Co. and the controlling Graham family. The sale, which shocked the news industry, is expected to close in October.Bezos said his major contribution to the business will be in offering his “point of view” in discussions with the paper’s leadership about how the publication should evolve. He also said he provides “runway” — financial support over a lengthy period in which the management can experiment to find a profitable formula for delivering the news.“If we figure out a new golden era at The Post .?.?. that will be due to the ingenuity and inventiveness and experimentation of the team at The Post,” he said. “I’ll be there with advice from a distance. If we solve that problem, I won’t deserve credit for it.”During his visit Tuesday and Wednesday, Bezos plans to meet with Post publisher Katharine Weymouth and top managers of the paper’s business and editorial operations. He will tour the newsroom in downtown Washington and the production plant in suburban Springfield, Va.Wednesday’s visit will be bracketed by meetings with Post journalists — first with about 20 reporters and editors in the morning and concluding with a town hall-style meeting with the entire newsroom in the afternoon. The last time Bezos encountered a roomful of the paper’s journalists was in 1999, when he was the guest of Katharine Graham, the company’s late chairman, during a luncheon interview with reporters and editors.Based on his comments in the interview Friday, Bezos appears unlikely to make any major decisions or pronouncements during his visit or propose any immediate changes. He said he is eager to meet with and listen to managers and learn about the news organization’s operations.The Post is the first newspaper that Bezos has owned and will be operated as a stand-alone business, independent of Amazon. Bezos intends to keep his “day job” as chairman and chief executive of Amazon and will continue living in Seattle, where the company is based.Bezos is one of the world’s richest men, with a net worth of around $24 billion, based on the current value of his Amazon stock holdings. His deep pockets, technological savvy and reputation as a long-term strategic thinker were among the attributes that Post Co. chief executive Donald E. Graham cited in selling him The Post after 80 years under the Graham family’s control. Graham said he saw no alternative to continued investment, which would be difficult for a publicly traded company.Graham and Weymouth, his niece, quietly put the business up for sale earlier this year after concluding that The Post required an owner capable of making sustained investment in it.Bezos agreed: “It’s important for The Post not just to survive, but to grow,” he said. “The product of The Post is still great. The piece that’s missing is that it’s a challenged business. No business can continue to shrink. That can only go on for so long before irrelevancy sets in.”In the interview, Bezos stressed that he has no immediate fixes for newspapers in general or for The Post, which is beset by Web-based competition that has weakened its advertising base and steadily sapped its print readership.“Don was helpful in interviews [following the purchase] when he said, ‘Mr. Bezos is a businessman, not a magician,’?” Bezos said. “I thanked him for that afterwards. In my experience, the way invention, innovation and change happen is [through] team effort. There’s no lone genius who figures it all out and sends down the magic formula. You study, you debate, you brainstorm and the answers start to emerge. It takes time. Nothing happens quickly in this mode. You develop theories and hypotheses, but you don’t know if readers will respond. You do as many experiments as rapidly as possible. ‘Quickly’ in my mind would be years.”But Bezos suggested that the current model for newspapers in the Internet era is deeply flawed: “The Post is famous for its investigative journalism,” he said. “It pours energy and investment and sweat and dollars into uncovering important stories. And then a bunch of Web sites summarize that [work] in about four minutes and readers can access that news for free. One question is, how do you make a living in that kind of environment? If you can’t, it’s difficult to put the right resources behind it. .?.?. Even behind a paywall [digital subscription], Web sites can summarize your work and make it available for free. From a reader point of view, the reader has to ask, ‘Why should I pay you for all that journalistic effort when I can get it for free’ from another site?”Although he said he reads The Post, New York Times and Wall Street Journal regularly, Bezos didn’t grow up immersed in newspapers or dreaming of being involved with one. His “love affair,” he said, has always been with “the printed word in all its forms.” Amazon started as an online book retailer; it now publishes its own books. It has also moved into video production, competing with Netflix and others in streaming original programs. Bezos’s wife, MacKenzie, is a published novelist.The Internet and Amazon’s launch of the Kindle e-reader convinced him that the printed word doesn’t have to be on paper. “The key thing about a book is that you lose yourself in the author’s world,” Bezos said. “Great writers create an alternative world. It doesn’t matter if you enter that world” via a digital or printed source.After Graham broached the idea of Bezos buying the paper earlier this year, Bezos said he spent two months contemplating what he could bring to the business. He was convinced that The Post was “an important institution,” and he said he was optimistic about its future. But he needed time to think over a third issue.“I had to convince myself that I could bring something to the table,” he said. “I discussed this at great length with Don. I thought I could, because I could offer runway and some skill in technology and the Internet and a point of view about long-term thinking, reader focus and the willingness to experiment.”Added Bezos: “I’m a genetic optimist. I’ve been told, ‘Jeff, you’re fooling yourself; the problem is unsolvable.’ But I don’t think so. It just takes a lot of time, patience and experimentation.”Asked how he saw The Post — as a local, national or international news organization — Bezos demurred. “That’s a question that needs to be answered in concert with the leadership team of The Post. Is it local? Or national? Is it something new?” Whatever the mission, he said, The Post will have “readers at its centerpiece. I’m skeptical of any mission that has advertisers at its centerpiece. Whatever the mission is, it has news at its heart.”Craig Timberg contributed to this article.</td>\n",

       "      <td>It has been a difficult year for the left politically, but at least with respect to the minimum wage, progressive activists had major victories — including in a couple of very red states.As a result, the minimum wage will increase in 19 states as 2016 comes to a close, according to figures compiled by the National Conference of State Legislatures. Two more states and the District of Columbia will raise the minimum later in the new year.The greatest increase will apply to companies in New York City with at least 10 employees. Minimum-wage workers at these businesses will receive a raise of $2 an hour on Saturday as the floor increases from $9 to $11. More-modest increases will apply to smaller firms in New York City and companies elsewhere in the state.Workers also will receive substantial raises in states carried by President-elect Donald Trump. In Arizona, the hourly minimum will increase from $8.05 to $10. The floor will increase from $7.50 to $9 in Maine, from $8.50 to $8.90 in Michigan and from $8 to $8.50 in Arkansas.Those increases follow a series of convincing wins for labor on the issue in Republican territory. Polling by the Public Religion Research Institute last year found that 3 in 5 Republicans and nearly 3 in 4 independent voters would support increasing the federal minimum wage from $7.25 to $10.10.In 2014, for instance, voters approved increases in Alaska, Nebraska and South Dakota. In Arizona in November, voters approved an initiative to increase the minimum wage by a comfortable margin of 58 percent to 42 percent.Trump, who carried Arizona with 49 percent of the vote, has taken inconsistent positions on the minimum wage.When asked in a debate a year ago whether he supported an increase in the minimum wage, he said, “I would not do it.” In May, though, Trump altered his position, seeming to suggest that, while he would support an increase in the minimum, he thought that states should set the levels and that the federal government should not enforce a minimum at all.Trump's nominee to be secretary of labor, Andrew Puzder, is a fast-food executive who has written that substantial increases in the minimum wage will force employers to hire fewer workers.While proponents of minimum-wage increases have had impressive successes, they did not expand that momentum this year to the 21 states that have not set floors above the federal minimum of $7.25. Workers making the minimum in those states will not get a legally mandated raise this year.Seven of the 19 states raising minimums this weekend will record modest increases of between a nickel and a dime per hour to adjust for increases in the cost of living.More from Wonkblog:The hidden cost of made-in-America retail bargainsThose jobs Trump is bragging about are just a fraction of Sprint's huge layoffsThe public is being kept in the dark about Trump’s deal with Carrier</td>\n",

       "      <td>North Korea caused even more bafflement than usual when, on Wednesday, it announced that a lowly traffic cop would receive the state's highest honor, a medal called \"The Hero of the Republic.\" The award is typically reserved for military derring-do or nuclear scientists. More confusing still was the official announcement, which stated with conspicuous vagueness that the \"traffic girl,\" as they're typically called, was being honored for \"safeguarding the security of the headquarters of the revolution in an unexpected circumstance.\" What circumstance? What does \"safeguarding\" mean?An official state video showed the traffic cop, a young woman name Ri Kong Sim, convulsing with emotion as she received her award.The conspiracy theories flowed quickly, with a North Korean defector organization suggesting that she may have saved leader Kim Jong Un from an assassination attempt. According to some thinly sourced reports, North Korean agents may have staged car accidents in the past to kill their targets.It turns out, though, that the explanation may be considerably more modest. New Focus International, a North Korean news organization that sources from defectors and from volunteer citizens within the country, says that its sources in Pyongyang indicate that Ri \"received the award for putting out a fire that broke out near a propaganda poster.\" The poster allegedly bore the name of leader Kim Jong Un.This explanation might sound absurd, but it's not implausible. I suggested this could be the case in my original post on Ri's mysterious award, noting that North Korea often grants high honors to people who simply save official portraits of its national rulers. Those omnipresent portraits, like the Eucharist at a Catholic mass, are considered quasi-holy symbols of everything that’s supposed to matter in the North Korean state ideology.New Focus International's story also notes that North Korea is still technically in a \"Grade 1 War-Readiness State,\" owing to recent tensions with the United States. This state includes special, heightened rules requiring citizens to protect images and icons of the leaders. That's partly about propaganda and ideology – Kim is the embodiment the state, after all – but it also has the nice effect, probably comforting for Kim, of making it the personal duty of every North Korea citizen to care so much about their leader that they'll even self-sacrifice to protect a banner carrying his name.\"The Real North Korea,\" a new book by the highly respected scholar Andrei Lankov, also discusses the degree to which official state ideology treats posters and banners of the Kim family as holy relics, the embodiment of the semi-divine leaders themselves. In this clip, Lankov discusses an unsettling incident in which a father was rewarded for allowing his 5-year-old daughter to drown so that he could save a poster of former leaders Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il:In an emergency, statues and portraits are to be protected whatever the cost, as any sacred object should be — and North Koreans are reminded that they must safeguard the images. For example, in 2007 the official media widely reported an incident that allegedly occurred in August of that year.During a severe flooding, Kang Hyong Kwon, a factory worker from the city of Ich’on, was trying to make his way to safety through a dangerous stream. While leaving his flooded house, he took the two most precious things in his life — his five-year-old daughter and portraits of Leaders Generalissimo Kim Il Sung and Marshal Kim Jong Il. Suddenly overwhelmed by the current, he lost grip of his daughter, who fell into the swollen waters, but still managed to keep hold of the sacred images. The media extolled North Koreans to emulate Kang Hyong Kwon, a real-life hero.Think about that for a moment. If North Korean officials are going to promote this man as a hero for saving a poster of the Kims while his daughter drowned, would it really be so surprising if they granted a top military honor to a traffic cop who saved a burning banner bearing Kim Jong Un's name?That's a significantly different story from the initial rumor that she had prevented Kim's assassination. As the North Korea scholar Stephanie Kleine-Ahlbrandt quipped on Twitter, \"We know so little about North Korea that a military medal given to a traffic cop becomes rumor of a coup.\"</td>\n",

       "      <td>ATHENS — Maybe the German leader meant to reassure Greece when he promised emergency assistance of food and medicine. But to many in the embattled Mediterranean nation, it sounded more like a threat.The hard line on Greece adopted by Europe’s economic powerhouse has, if anything, strengthened in the days since Greek voters resoundingly rejected tougher cuts, sending shock waves through the continent.Now Germany is refusing to budge on cutting Greece’s mountain of debt, even as the leftist leadership here — and the International Monetary Fund — insist that no deal is viable without such a reduction. This tough stance comes from a rules-oriented nation where even the language is conspiring against Greece’s struggles: Germans use the same word for “debt” and for “guilt.”“Of course we do not want to abandon the Greeks, but they do not have to be a member of the euro zone in order to receive help,” said Christian von Stetten, a lawmaker from German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union, summarizing an increasingly prevalent view in the German capital.“If, from the very beginning, there had been sanctions for not sticking to the rules, we would not have this problem,” von Stetten said. He noted that Greece was not the only member of the 19-nation euro zone to run afoul of the thicket of regulations that govern borrowing and spending in the monetary union.The mounting German anger after the Greek referendum on Sunday is a major challenge for Merkel, who, as the euro zone’s most powerful leader, needs to hold together its fractious members while preserving her domestic standing. She does not want to be blamed for a sudden Greek exit from the euro zone, but giving away too much would cost her at home.France and others are starting to break away, calling for a softened deal in the aftermath of the referendum. Merkel’s electorate, however, has had no such turnabout. Nor have her political allies.“Today we need the Iron Chancellor: No new billions for Greece!” read the front-page headline in Tuesday’s Bild tabloid, the top-circulating newspaper in Germany. It was accompanied by a doctored image of Merkel sporting a spiked helmet of the kind worn by Otto von Bismarck, the 19th-century leader who conquered Europe to build the German empire.“A lot of people in the government have moved toward the position where they say, ‘Let’s get rid of them no matter what,’?” said Sebastian Dullien, a senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations in Berlin.Many Germans say that without steely regulations to govern the conduct of European nations, the 63-year-old project to integrate the continent would swiftly fall apart. Giving in to populists in Greece would embolden others like them in places such as Spain and Italy, they say, and soon there would be a wave of political and economic upheaval across Europe.Merkel has repeatedly shot down Greek bailout proposals that insist on debt relief. As the clock ticked Tuesday on the collapse of the Greek banking sector, she again said ahead of a meeting of euro-zone leaders that she did not see any basis for negotiations.The tough approach aligns well with Germany’s broader attitudes toward rules and predictability. Germany is a nation where jaywalking is rare, even when streets are clear of cars, and where most subway stations use the honor system, operating without turnstiles.The adherence to rules is such a key tenet of life there that many Germans say they would rather send humanitarian aid if Greece goes bankrupt than forgive its debts and risk breaking the covenant that when money is borrowed, it must be repaid.Until the introduction of the euro, bankrupt individuals in Germany could wipe out their debts only after 30 years. Credit card usage in the country is among the lowest in Europe, and even many big-box stores there take only cash.That maximalist approach toward Greece, however, could prove costlier for German taxpayers, because the struggling nation would be unable to repay Germany’s $88 billion share of European rescue loans if it went bankrupt. A debt reduction would slice only a share off Greece’s towering obligations.But many German leaders are dead set against compromise.“Greece’s entry into the euro zone was very naive from today’s perspective,” German Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel told the newsmagazine Stern on Tuesday. Gabriel is also the leader of the center-left Social Democrats.“Nothing is gained if we just cut debt without fundamental changes in Greece,” Gabriel said. On Monday, he said E.U. countries needed to start readying humanitarian aid for Greece. He spoke from his party’s headquarters in Berlin, where red flags still fly and Karl Marx’s images adorn office walls. Similar parties in other countries have long favored stimulus spending and fought austerity, so his position is emblematic of the stark differences in German discourse.If Greece exits the euro zone, the aid may well be necessary. Greece imports much of its food and almost all of its medicine. Without a working banking system, or with a sharply devalued new currency, Greeks would struggle to pay for the basics while the cost of imports would rise sharply. After just over a week of capital controls that prevent Greeks from sending payments outside the country, shortages of staples are starting to appear.Some critics say that Germany’s aversion to softening Greece’s debt obligations ignores its own history. In a recent interview with Germany’s Die Zeit newspaper, economist Thomas Piketty pointed to Germany’s post-World War II debt restructuring. That deal, done under different circumstances, wiped away about half of what Germany owed other nations, including Greece.As basics dwindle on the shelves of Greek supermarkets, Merkel is playing a tricky balancing act, with much to lose if she takes a strong stand on either side of whether Greece should remain in the euro zone. Her legacy would suffer if she were seen as kicking the Greeks off the common currency. But if she advocates debt relief, voters may punish her at home. Already, her even tougher finance minister, Wolfgang Schäuble, has started to surpass her in popularity polls.Merkel “wants to avoid it being her to decide over this,” said Stefan Kornelius, author of a biography of the chancellor. He also wrote a column published Tuesday saying it was time for Greece to leave the euro zone.“She wants the Greek government to decide. She set the rules, and she wants Greece either to commit to it or leave it,” Kornelius added.Stephanie Kirchner in Berlin contributed to this report.Read more:7 key things to know about Greece’s debt crisis and what happens nextA hilarious Monty Python sketch explains why Greece is in a huge crisisThe forgotten origins of Greece’s crisis will make you think twice about who’s to blame</td>\n",

       "      <td>Alfonso Fanjul fled Cuba as a young man, leaving behind his family’s mansions and vast sugar-cane fields as they were being wrested away by the communist Castro regime.In exile in the United States, he built an even larger sugar empire, amassing one of North America’s great fortunes and befriending members of Congress and presidents who benefited from his largess. The sting of his family’s forced departure from Cuba led him to become one of the principal funders of the U.S. anti-Castro movement.Now, contrary to what almost anyone could have imagined, the 76-year-old Fanjul has begun to reassess old grievances and tentatively eye Cuba as a place for him and other U.S. businessmen to expand their enterprises. Quietly, without fanfare, Fanjul has started visiting the island of his birth and having conversations with top Cuban officials.“If there is some way the family flag could be taken back to Cuba, then I am happy to do that,” Fanjul said in a rare interview, publicly discussing his recent visits to the island for the first time.Fanjul’s about-face is a startling development for the exile network that has held a grip on the politics of U.S.-Cuba relations for decades and has played an outsize role in presidential campaigns. His trips place him at the vanguard of a group of ultra-wealthy U.S. investors with roots on the island whose economic interests and political clout are pushing the two countries toward a thaw in their half-century standoff.Fanjul, in the interview, said repeatedly that his primary motivation in visiting Cuba has been a desire to “reunite the Cuban family,” referring broadly to the Cuban diaspora and those who remain on the island. Business considerations could be explored only if there are political and diplomatic advances, he said.“The [Fanjul] family was in Cuba for 150 years, and, yes, at the end of the day, I’d like to see our family back in Cuba, where we started. .?.?. But it has to be under the right circumstances,” said Fanjul, who is best known by his nickname, “Alfy.” “One day we hope that the United States and Cuba would find a way so the whole Cuban community could be able to live and work together.”Fanjul, who lives in Palm Beach, Fla., and whose family holdings include Domino Sugar and refineries across the United States, Latin America and Europe, has managed to maintain a remarkably low profile for a politically connected tycoon. His access to the highest levels of power was evident during the Monica Lewinsky scandal of the 1990s, when the special prosecutor’s report noted that President Bill Clinton received a call from Fanjul during a private Oval Office moment with the intern.Last week, the Fanjul family’s influence over policymakers was on display when the U.S. House passed a farm bill that would cut subsidies to many agricultural products while leaving unscathed the controversial, taxpayer-backed program that protects sugar profits.Fanjul visited Cuba in April 2012 and again in February 2013 as part of a delegation licensed through the Brookings Institution, the Washington think tank that has produced recent papers criticizing U.S. policy and calling on the Obama administration to further loosen sanctions. In Havana, he lingered with tears in his eyes at his family’s colonial-era manse, now a museum, with its elegant columns, lush inner courtyard, sparkling chandeliers and grand staircase.He was so taken by the nostalgia and excitement of returning to the familiar streets of his youth, a travel companion recalled, that Fanjul enthusiastically chatted up random people of all ages as he walked around. He also met with Cuba’s foreign minister and toured state-run farms and a sugar mill with Cuban agricultural officials.Unlike most other Cuban Americans who travel to the island, Fanjul has direct access to some of America’s most important policymakers. After returning from his first trip, Fanjul met with his good friend, then-Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, to express his changing views on Cuba. In November, Fanjul once again discussed his evolving mind-set with Clinton and her husband at a Clinton Foundation fundraiser in the Miami home of Cuban American businessman Paul Cejas, a former U.S. ambassador to Belgium.Many embargo supporters say U.S. policy should change only when certain conditions are met, such as regime change or political reforms. Fanjul, however, said he prefers not to answer the question of whether he would require the fall of the Castro government or an end to communism before doing business in Cuba — saying that he respects existing U.S. law.“Right now there’s no way for us to consider investing in Cuba. How can you work a deal if you’re not legally allowed to do it?” he said.“Now, would we consider an investment at some later date?” continued Fanjul, a permanent U.S. resident who maintains Spanish citizenship. “If there’s an arrangement within Cuba and the United States, and legally it can be done and there’s a proper framework set up and in place, then we will look at that possibility. We have an open mind.”He said the Cuban government — which has business deals with companies from countries such as Canada and Spain — would have to change its economic structure to make it easier and safer for outside companies to make money.“Cuba has to presumably satisfy the requirements that investors need, which are primarily a return on investment and security of the investment, so they feel comfortable with what they’re doing,” he said. “I personally would look at that in the same framework as any investor would.”Evolving politicsThe logistical, political and legal complexities involved in any potential expansion of U.S.-based businesses onto Cuban soil are staggering. Fanjul’s willingness to hold meetings with the Castro government puts him on a potential collision course with Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Robert Menendez (D-N.J.), a Cuban American whose campaigns have been supported by Fanjul but who is an unwavering advocate for the embargo and has the power to thwart any attempts to lift it.Trickier still would be the impact on presidential politics, with Florida’s Cuban American electorate still a significant factor in the battle for that state’s crucial electoral college votes.Already, there have been signs that younger Cuban Americans, particularly those born in the United States, are moving away from the hard-line views of their parents and grandparents. Now, as Fanjul’s recent gestures show, even some of the most entrenched exiles are evolving, and politicians accustomed to embracing the Cuba trade embargo in their pursuit of Florida’s large Cuban American electorate will have to calibrate the risks and rewards of evolving along with them.Hillary Clinton, the putative Democratic front-runner for president if she chooses to run in 2016, spoke out in favor of the Obama administration’s actions relaxing restrictions on family travel and cash flow to the island. Yet she, like many politicians in both parties, has repeatedly expressed support for continued sanctions. She is close with several key players, besides Fanjul, who have stated an openness to more engagement with Cuba.Fanjul, a longtime supporter of Bill Clinton’s campaigns and causes, would probably be a major donor, as well as a close adviser on Cuba-related matters, to Hillary Clinton should she run. Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D), a longtime Clinton confidant, traveled to Cuba for a trade mission in recent years and held discussions with high-ranking government officials there. And Cejas, whom Bill Clinton appointed ambassador to Belgium, has expressed doubts about the U.S. trade embargo against Cuba.“I can tell you one thing that became very clear to me: The embargo is really an embargo against America ourselves. Because Americans cannot do business with Cuba, where there are incredible opportunities for growth,” said Cejas, who traveled to Cuba with Fanjul.The issue could prove thornier for Republicans,</td>\n",

       "      <td>The New York Times is playing it safe on the Sony documents.“This is stolen material,” New York Times reporter Jeremy Peters said today on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe.” “As our lawyers are telling our reporters at the New York Times, we are not to open these e-mails. We are not to actively look at them. We are only allowed to report on what has been out there because this is stolen material and trafficking in it is, in itself, a criminal act.”This stolen material has been dredged up by a hacking effort known as “Guardians of Peace” against Sony Pictures Entertainment, which produced “The Interview,” a film starring Seth Rogen and James Franco as journalists who sign on to a government plot to assassinate North Korean strongman Kim Jong Un. Reams of internal Sony information have spilled from the hack — e-mails, data on salaries and business considerations — not to mention the fact that producer Scott Rudin called star Angelina Jolie a “minimally talented spoiled brat.”Sony demands that media organizations do not republish the hacked material. In a strongly worded Dec. 14 letter to publishers, superlawyer David Boies wrote that Sony “does not consent to your possession, review, copying, dissemination, publication, uploading, downloading, or making any use of the Stolen Information.” Those who dis Sony on this matter are in trouble, according to Boies, who writes that the company will have “no choice but to hold you responsible for any damage or loss arising from such use or dissemination by you.”The Times has taken that threat seriously. In a same-day piece on the Boies letter, the newspaper turned up its nose at other outlets that have participated in the disclosures: “Until now, the data has provided a feast for traffic-hungry websites like Fusion and those owned by Gawker Media, along with some mainstream news organizations like Bloomberg, which last week posted an article — without citing names — revealing details of employee medical records that were made public by the hackers.”As for its own approach, that same Times piece disclosed, “The Times has reported on some Sony emails and company-related data based on the accounts of other news organizations and on statements from Sony executives. Sony representatives have acknowledged the authenticity of the emails and data.” Huffington Post media reporter Michael Calderone obtained further clarification from The Times, which outlined a balancing act: “The Sony situation poses difficult questions. We don’t condone hacking into private computer systems. We also don’t like depriving our readers of information they care about.”Actor Brad Pitt, Jolie’s husband, found something unsavory in the reporting frenzy: “I don’t see a difference in News Corp hacking phone calls and hacking e-mails. I don’t think we should be able to participate,” said Pitt. “I think someone’s conversation, whether in e-mail or in person, should be private. We shouldn’t be participating and these sites that are disseminating them should stop. They won’t. And we should stop reading them. We won’t. It’s more of an indictment on us, I think.”Pitt sees no difference in these two things; the law sees an enormous one. As the Erik Wemple Blog has noted previously, Supreme Court jurisprudence protects U.S. media organizations that lawfully receive information that’s been unlawfully obtained. Say what? Yes — if some scoundrel hacks into a computer or illegally tapes a phone call and then posts it to the Internet, there’s nothing illegal about passing it along. That very protection is encased in a 2001 Supreme Court case, Bartnicki v. Vopper, which involved a scandalous recording of a phone conversation, one that had been allegedly recorded illegally, that ended up in the hands of talk radio host Frederick Vopper. Justice John Paul Stevens wrote for the court that Vopper acted within the law: “[A] stranger’s illegal conduct does not suffice to remove the First Amendment shield from speech about a matter of public concern.”Clay Calvert, a University of Florida professor, told the Erik Wemple Blog for a previous post, “If the news media lawfully obtain truthful information about a matter of public significance, then the government may not constitutionally punish publication of the information, absent an interest of the highest order.” For further analysis, see this post by Eugene Volokh, who notes that two of the six justices in the majority opinion opined that the information needs to be of “great public concern.”Bold text added to highlight the triviality of much of the Sony hacking oeuvre. Is a Hollywood producer’s attitude toward Angelina Jolie a matter of public significance? Are the negotiations of New York Times journalists with Sony executives of matter of public significance? Is the fact that Sony bigwig Amy Pascal had to apologize over racially insensitive e-mails a matter of public significance? Well, she apologized and her replacement appears likely, according to the Hollywood Reporter. Case closed on public significance.Appeals to suppress the work of these hackers automatically elicit sympathy. In the pantheon of American leaking heroes, the Guardians of Peace aren’t Daniel Ellsberg (Pentagon Papers); they aren’t W. Mark Felt (Watergate); they aren’t Jeffrey Wigand (tobacco); they aren’t Edward Snowden (National Security Agency). Instead, they’re a group that has threatened terrorism on theaters that show “The Interview.”Yet it’s not the media’s job to judge the people who steal information. The media’s job is to judge the stolen information itself: If it’s worth publishing, then publish.Some may argue that media trafficking in the Sony documents will only encourage other hackers to break into other companies’ systems. If that’s true, then those companies should buttress their systems. But either way, that’s not the problem of news outlets.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Metro and local emergency responders are proposing to collaborate for the first time in testing radio equipment at Metro stations and tunnels, officials said Monday, following communication problems during several incidents.The proposal to devise joint testing was described in a letter to Sen. Mark R. Warner after the Virginia Democrat asked Metro and the Washington Council of Governments about communication breakdowns during the Jan. 12 incident near the L’Enfant Plaza station that killed one person and injured 86 others.Federal investigators are reviewing the cause and the response to the smoke that filled a tunnel near the L’Enfant Plaza station, where a train had become disabled. Their early inspection found “severe electrical arcing damage” to the rail and cables inside the tunnel.Metro is collecting information on radio testing being conducted throughout the system to present to a committee of fire chiefs that works with the regional government council, said Metro spokesman Dan Stessel. A meeting of that committee is set for this month, according to the letter to Warner.“We would like to see this meeting happen as soon as possible,” Stessel said.Stessel also said Monday that Metro has resolved radio problems that affected coverage in parts of the Wheaton Station on the Red Line. Montgomery County Fire and Rescue had flagged the issue to Metro Friday afternoon after its crews ran a routine test, according to a fire department e-mail.The problem involved a connector on a cable that carries signals from aboveground to the underground station.The problem at Wheaton was the only one found after testing at the county’s 12 Metro stations, Stessel said. While a repair was pending, firefighters were reminded to communicate using a radio-relay system that positions them within sight of each other at key points between the tunnel and surface.Signal-relaying equipment is built into the subway and maintained by Metro. But regularly troubleshooting communication problems falls on Metro and each local jurisdiction.Although Metro and local jurisdictions test radio communications within the system, they do so independently of each other.Warner said he sees “a real challenge” more than a decade after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks and massive investments in emergency communications.“Your system may be working but the handoff — the interoperability — is the place where so many things can go wrong,” Warner said.Warner said the letter laid out a tentative timeline for making changes, but even the earliest actions would be two months off.Warner was part of the local congressional delegation given a limited briefing of events about the crisis. An early review found that District firefighters in the L’Enfant Plaza tunnel had trouble communicating with commanders aboveground. Since then, Metro and the D.C. Fire Department have largely blamed each other for the communications problem.Their dispute centers on whether the District made technical changes to the way its radios work, when those changes were made, and what it told Metro about those changes in order for the rail system to make equipment adjustments in response.An e-mail released by the District as part of its review of the incident shows that firefighters flagged a radio problem to Metro in an e-mail on Jan. 8, four days before the incident at L’Enfant Plaza.Metro officials said crews worked through that weekend trying to pinpoint a problem on its side, and when it couldn’t find any arranged for a Jan. 14 meeting with the District for additional checks, two days after the L’Enfant Plaza incident occurred.Metro and D.C. emergency officials say the communication problems have been fixed.</td>\n",

       "      <td>A federal grand jury in San Antonio indicted a truck driver for his alleged role in the smuggling deaths of 10 undocumented immigrants found in the trailer of a truck in a Walmart parking lot in July, officials said Wednesday.James Matthew Bradley Jr., 60, received five felony counts, including smuggling migrants for financial gain resulting in death — a charge that could carry the death penalty. Other charges range from 10 to 20 years in federal prison, the Justice Department said in a release.Seven Mexicans and one Guatemalan were found dead in the trailer in San Antonio under stiflingly hot summer conditions, with as many as 200 people tightly packed and struggling to breathe through small holes. Two migrants later died in a hospital.Currently, two remain hospitalized, five were released to immigration authorities, and 22 are being held as material witnesses, according to the Justice Department.Some of the travelers had spent days held in a house near the border with Mexico. Some were told to pay hundreds of dollars to a group linked to Los Zetas, a deadly Mexican drug cartel, for safe passage across the Rio Grande in rafts, The Washington Post reported.Bradley initially told authorities he was unaware of the trailer’s cargo and was surprised when he realized people had been trapped inside. He owned the truck found outside Walmart but not the trailer, according to public records. He told federal agents that the trailer’s refrigeration system did not work and that the vent holes were probably clogged, according to the criminal complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas.The truck’s discovery revealed the group’s horrifying journey to the United States at a time when immigration arrests have spiked under President Trump and illegal border crossings have plummeted, according to federal officials. The case also highlighted the extreme dangers people face as they try to enter the country.Jack Staton, acting assistant director of intelligence for Immigration and Custom Enforcement’s Homeland Security Investigations arm, called human smuggling “100 percent crime against humanity,” adding that “this is just victimizing people that are attempting to get a better life.”“The smugglers closed the doors and the interior of the trailer was pitch black and it was already hot inside,” James Lara, a special agent with Homeland Security Investigations wrote in the complaint after interviewing one of the migrants.“He stated they were not provided with any water or food. People inside were making noise to get someone’s attention but nobody ever came.”Maria Sacchetti, Mark Berman and Lindsey Bever provided additional reporting.

       "      <td>Millions of drivers whose cars have been recalled to replace air bags that explode and spray deadly shards of metal may not be fully protected unless they have the potentially dangerous inflaters replaced twice, a federal regulator told Congress on Thursday.The testimony of Mark Rosekind, head of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, came a day after the regulatory agency said an additional 85 million vehicles could face air-bag recalls unless the manufacturer can prove they are safe. Almost 29 million cars already have been recalled after inflater ruptures killed 10 people in the United States and maimed at least 100 more.Rosekind said Thursday that the inflaters being installed in recalled vehicles may themselves become defective but that the evidence suggests they will perform to design for several years.“At this point we’re only seeing ruptures at 7? 1/ 2 years,” Rosekind said. “A certain number that are being replaced have at least a 7? 1/ 2 -year time span available for that safety to protect people in the vehicle.”The news that some recalled vehicles may need to have their air-bag inflaters replaced twice adds a fresh layer of complexity to the issue. The air bags were manufactured by the world’s largest maker of air bags, a Japanese firm named Takata, and installed by a majority of automakers. Unlike most air-bag makers, Takata uses ammonium nitrate to trigger a small explosion that inflates the air bag when the vehicle strikes something.But in some vehicles — particularly those that were several years old and kept in regions with high humidity — the ammonium nitrate burns too fast, causing the chemical’s container to explode and spray drivers and passengers with metal shrapnel.Many Takata replacement air bags still use the ammonium nitrate that is suspected to cause the explosive malfunctions, and Rosekind said Thursday that testing has proved that the chemical deteriorates over time.Many air-bag inflaters have been replaced since the recalls began in 2014, and dealers should have notified drivers about whether their new inflaters were triggered by ammonium nitrate and whether they should be replaced a second time when inflaters without the chemical become available, Rosekind said.“If the dealer tells you that it’s an interim remedy, then you would know that you’ll be recalled again for a second fix,” Rosekind said. “You don’t want people to get that first [replacement] and think they’re done.”With replacement air bags on back order, many dealers have been telling drivers who have received recall notices that it may take weeks or months before their inflaters can be replaced.Getting drivers to comply with recall notices is a challenge, said Mitch Bainwol, president of the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, a trade group that represents 12 major foreign and domestic automakers.“We do mail and email until we’re blue in the face,” Bainwol told the House subcommittee. “It’s tough. We need help.”NHTSA is launching a pilot program in which automakers work with state motor-vehicle administrations to include recall information in renewal notices for licenses and auto registration. Six states will take part in the pilot program.“As much as is currently being done, it’s not enough,” Rosekind said, enumerating 19 new strategies developed to draw the attention of drivers to recall notices.Huma Hanif, 17, died March 31 when an air bag malfunctioned after her car hit another vehicle at an intersection in suburban Houston. The auto dealer and Honda said they had sent six air-bag recall notices to Hanif’s family, but family members said they had not received the notices.On Wednesday, NHTSA gave Takata until the end of 2019 to prove that their new process for ensuring the safety of inflaters triggered by ammonium nitrate is effective. The company is using a drying agent called desiccant to keep the chemical from deteriorating when exposed to heat and humidity. If Takata fails to provide that proof, it could lead to a recall of an additional 85 million cars.Rep. Janice Schakowsky (D-Ill.) asked Rosekind whether potentially defective air bags were being installed in newly manufactured cars.“It would be illegal to sell a known defect in a new car,” Rosekind said.An earlier version of this story stated that Takata has until the end of 2018 to prove that their new process for ensuring safety of inflaters is effective. The company has until the end of 2019.</td>\n",

       "      <td>By all accounts, Wednesday's encounter between French police and a group of suspected terrorists in the Paris suburbs was an incredibly violent one: 5,000 bullets fired, dozens of grenades thrown, bodies so damaged that at first authorities were unable to say how many people had been killed.So it's somewhat remarkable that there was only one fatality on the police side of the showdown: Diesel, a 7-year-old Belgian Malinois police dog who was sent into the apartment at one point to check for survivors. The dog was killed when one of the people in the apartment detonated a suicide vest.Diesel's death sparked a popular hashtag and an outpouring of respect and grief on social media. And it highlighted the role specially trained dogs play in often dangerous law enforcement situations in France, as well as right here in the United States.It's unclear exactly how many police dogs are active in the United States. Jim Watson, director of the North American Police Work Dog Association, gave a \"wild guess\" of around 50,000 dogs in 2010. The dogs are deployed to various domestic law enforcement agencies, doing everything from bomb- and drug-sniffing to chasing down suspected criminals.And, unfortunately, police dog work can sometimes be deadly. The Officer Down Memorial Page, which tracks police fatalities in the line of duty, includes numbers on police dog fatalities as well. Their numbers show that in 2015 so far, 26 police dogs have been killed in the line of duty — a number that's up sharply over the previous two years.In the most recent incident they've tracked, a dog named Hyco with the Anderson County Sheriff's Office in South Carolina was shot and killed while chasing a group of suspected carjackers. In September, a police dog named Ike in Washington state was stabbed multiple times while attempting to subdue a suspect and had to be euthanized due to the extent of his injuries.But while a number of dogs have died at the hands of a suspected criminal this year, the ODMP's numbers show that canine officers face an even bigger threat: heat exhaustion, particularly from being left in a squad car on a hot day.This year alone at least 11 dogs died from heat exhaustion, according to the ODMP. In August, two dogs with the Baltimore City Detention Center died when the air conditioning failed in a vehicle they were in. In Florida, an officer was suspended without pay in May when he inadvertently left two police dogs in a car at his home.The heat deaths \"happen at a pretty alarming rate,\" said Steve Weiss, an NYPD lieutenant who serves as ODMP's Director of Research. \"I was surprised by how often it happens.\"Weiss says that many K9 unit vehicles are now being outfitted with electronic systems that automatically regulate heat and humidity. Some systems can alert remote officers if the AC fails or the temperature gets too high, and allow them to immediately pop the trunk or doors to allow dogs to escape. More widespread adoption of these systems would cut down on the heat exhaustion deaths, according to Weiss.Weiss says better laws protecting police dogs would help too. \"The laws in many states involving the deaths of police animals are not very strict,\" he said. \"Every state is different.\"Update: This piece has been updated to reflect that authorities do not currently believe the woman in the apartment, Hasna Aitboulahcen, detonated the suicide vest.</td>\n",

       "      <td>The student activist who led the successful push to rename the University of Maryland football stadium is trying to jump-start a movement to erect a statue of Harriet Tubman on the grounds of the Maryland State House.The area surrounding the capitol building has long been controversial because it houses a statue of Roger Taney, the Supreme Court justice who authored the proslavery Dred Scott decision.A compromise struck in the mid-1990s kept the Taney statue on the grounds while adding a statue of Thurgood Marshall, the first African American appointed to the nation’s highest court.Legislation that called for placing statues of Tubman and fellow abolitionist Frederick Douglass alongside Taney failed in 2012 and 2013.Colin Byrd, a University of Maryland student who is pushing for the Tubman statue, says he is banking on extra momentum after the Treasury Department decided to put Tubman on $20 bills.Byrd says adding a statue of Tubman to the State House grounds without taking down Taney’s statue should mollify critics who say removing memorials to slavery supporters is tantamount to erasing history.“Even those people would agree a lot of history can be learned from Harriet Tubman’s life and times,” Byrd said. “It’s about balance .?.?. there were two sides to this slavery debate, and Tubman was on the right side of it, while Taney was wrong.”Byrd organized fellow students to push university regents last year to change the name of the school’s football stadium, which had honored segregationist and former university president H.C. “Curley” Byrd.The board voted 12-to-5 in December to change the name of the facility to “Maryland Stadium.”So far, state lawmakers have not signed onto Colin Byrd’s effort to add a Tubman statue outside the State House. But Byrd — who is African American and not related to the long-ago university president — has received high-profile backing from actress Viola Davis, who is playing Tubman in an upcoming HBO biopic.In a statement released by her production company, Davis said Tubman was “an integral part of American history, and it’s time for the masses to truly understand and acknowledge the scope of who she was and what she has accomplished — that, quite bluntly, no man ever has.”Montgomery County Executive Isiah Leggett (D) sent Gov. Larry Hogan (R) a letter this month in support of a Tubman statue. Elected officials in Dorchester County, where Tubman was born, have urged legislative leaders to support the effort.Another attempt by officials in Maryland to honor Tubman fizzled in 2011.Activists, with the support of then-Gov. Martin O’Malley (D), had pushed to replace a statue in the U.S. Capitol of John Hanson — an 18th-century slave owner from southern Maryland who was a member of the Continental Congress — with one of Tubman. A bill requesting the swap did not pass.</td>\n",

       "      <td>What’s the best way to bring cutting-edge healthcare to the world’s poorest places? It can be tempting to export money and equipment to solve the problem. But when bioengineer Rebecca Richards-Kortum visits hospitals in places such as Malawi and El Salvador, she sees the unintended consequence of that charitable impulse.“Ironically, if you walk down the hall or into the basement of a hospital, there’s always a big room that is just for broken, donated equipment,” she says. The equipment works just fine in the United States, but in places plagued by lack of air conditioning, power outages, and challenges like dust and dirt, what would be a high-tech lifesaver in the U.S. is just another hunk of junk. Given the amount of time, energy, space and money that can go into figuring out how to use the equipment and repairing it when it breaks, says Richards-Kortum, “it can hurt more than it helps.”Could there be a better way? Richards-Kortum thinks so — and her efforts to bring affordable, adaptable technology to the world’s poorest places earned her a spot in this year’s class of MacArthur fellows. Richards-Kortum, who heads up Rice University’s Institute for Global Health, uses the latest advances in nanotechnology, fabrication and molecular imaging to help invent equipment that’s rugged enough to stand up to the most challenging clinical conditions and cheap enough to make sense for communities that usually lack access to health care.“Cheaper can certainly be as effective,” says Richards-Kortum. “In some cases it can be better in the sense that it improves access.” Take her high-resolution microscopic endoscope, which her team developed in conditions in countries that have high rates of cervical cancer but low access to things like labs that process pap smears or biopsies. Rather than collect tissue that is then analyzed in a laboratory, the portable endoscope lets technicians view cervical tissue, diagnosing cancer in real time and for less money. And by using new fluorescent dyes developed by Richards-Kortum and her team, doctors can spot oral cancers without spending as much money or time as they would using traditional diagnostics.Resource constraints don’t intimidate Richards-Kortum — they inspire her. “They force you to make really tough decisions,” she says. “I think you often end up with a better product.” She passes on that philosophy to students in Beyond Traditional Borders, a program she developed that teaches undergraduates how to translate classroom ideas into global health solutions. Students focus their efforts not on hypothetical situations, but on real-world problems, developing technologies that fill health needs.For example, a group of her students recently invented an inexpensive bubble CPAP machine for newborns who can’t breathe due to respiratory infections. Developed in conjunction with practitioners in Malawi, the technology decreased mortality rates in one neonatal ward by 46 percent. And patients in developing countries aren’t the only ones who benefit from the program. Students who participate in real-world projects in the program, she says, graduate at higher rates than STEM majors who don’t — especially women and underrepresented minority students.“If your inventions don’t ever leave the lab, you’re not doing your job,” she says. Similarly, she says, inventions that are designed in a vacuum are useless. Rather, she teaches her students to collaborate with end users, clinicians, and patients in the countries they seek to serve. That collaborative process can lead to even more inventive solutions, like a rapid prototyping facility Richards-Kortum helped develop at the University of Malawi. “They came up with a way to locally repair oxygen concentrators,” she says, instead of relying on a pricier, more complex fix.Though Richards-Kortum focuses the majority of her work on finding inexpensive ways to bring healthcare to the developing world, her inventions work the other way, too. She’s currently working to figure out ways to bring her cervical cancer detection system, which is currently being deployed on vans throughout rural Brazil, to under-served places in the United States, like the Rio Grande Valley in Texas.All that penny-pinching has earned Richards-Kortum an honor with a massive $625,000 stipend to use as she pleases. (“I was sure it was a telemarketer, but it turned out to not be a telemarketer,” she jokes of receiving the call from the foundation a few weeks ago.) She isn’t sure yet how she’ll use the money, but she’s committed to using it to improve health for babies and pregnant women in Malawi.“At the current rate of progress, it’s going to be 150 years before a baby who’s born in Africa has the same chance of survival as a baby in North America,” says Richard-Kortum. “I don’t want to live in that world.”Erin Blakemore (@heroinebook) is a freelance journalist from Boulder, Colo.

       "      <td>It’s been 13 years since the snakehead, a.k.a. the frankenfish, was first found in the Potomac River. Initial predictions were dire, but during recent years it’s become clear that the snakehead is just another fish in the river.The snakehead has not destroyed the Potomac River’s ecosystem as first predicted, and it appears that it’s coexisting with the other game fish in the river just fine. According to John Odenkirk, Virginia Department of Game &amp; Inland Fisheries (VDGIF) biologist, the bass population in the Potomac River is better now than in recent years.I interviewed Odenkirk regarding snakeheads in the Potomac River, and his interview, lightly edited, is below:KA: Which section of the Potomac River has the densest population of snakeheads?JO: The areas further downstream (away from D.C.), in newer colonized areas (with suitable habitat), generally will have higher numbers — these will usually be found in the back of tributary arms between Occoquan and Colonial Beach within both Maryland and Virginia. Areas closer to D.C. with higher numbers in Virginia are Aquia Creek (Stafford Co.) and the Occoquan River.KA: During the past few years, has the population of snakeheads increased, decreased, or remained the same in the Potomac River? Has increased fishing pressure helped to reduce the snakehead population?JO: Snakehead abundance increased dramatically after colonization, but trends suggest that increases in abundance may have slowed. Population estimates for Little Hunting Creek (tidal tributary of the Potomac River) declined each year from 2013 to 2015, supporting the assertion that northern snakehead density increases have slowed or that density has stabilized in some creeks.In the areas where they have been longest (e.g., around Mount Vernon), numbers seem to be declining in most Virginia creeks. I am fairly certain that a high level of exploitation (both commercial and recreational), which encompasses the huge increase in bow fishing, due to this fish, has helped suppress numbers.KA: During the past few years, has the population of game fish, such as bass and walleye, increased, decreased, or remained the same in sections of the Potomac River which have snakeheads?JO: We never see walleye in the Virginia portion of the tidal Potomac. This year, the largemouth bass population looks fantastic. On balance, the bass fishery has been better in the past five or six years than longer ago (during early phase of snakehead expansion). In short, it appears both populations are functioning completely independently of one another with no competition (plenty of forage to support both at current levels).KA: Snakeheads are fun to catch and are also delicious to eat. Is there a chance they will ever get reclassified as a game fish, with trophy citations awarded?JO: Maybe someday. Probably citations before game fish status, if it happens.KA: What is the largest or heaviest snakehead documented to have been harvested in the Potomac River?JO: We don’t track those numbers officially, but it’s in the 17- to 18-pound range.KA: Do snakeheads pose more of a risk to the ecosystem of lakes, such as Burke Lake and Lake Brittle, than to the ecosystem of a large river, such as the Potomac?JO: We hope not and should have an answer in a few years, as folks have illegally stocked them in both these VDGIF-owned lakes. We have copious historical data from which to gauge community response. Both lakes are productive (fertile) systems. One concern some folks have is with illegal introductions in less productive systems.KA: When were snakeheads first found in the Potomac River?JO: The fish was first found in the Potomac River in May 2004.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Although we seldom think about them this way, most American communities as they exist today were built for the spry and mobile. We've constructed millions of multi-story, single-family homes where the master bedroom is on the second floor, where the lawn outside requires weekly upkeep, where the mailbox is a stroll away. We've designed neighborhoods where everyday errands require a driver's license. We've planned whole cities where, if you don't have a car, it's not particularly easy to walk anywhere — especially not if you move gingerly.This reality has been a fine one for a younger country. Those multi-story, single-family homes with broad lawns were great for Baby Boomers when they had young families. And car-dependent suburbs have been fine for residents with the means and mobility to drive everywhere. But as the Baby Boomers whose preferences drove a lot of these trends continue to age, it's becoming increasingly clear that the housing and communities we've built won't work very well for the old.A new report from Harvard's Joint Center for Housing Studies and the AARP renews this warning. What will happen to Baby Boomers stuck in suburbia once they can't drive anymore? Where will an aging population with more disabilities live when we've built so little accessible housing? How will they pay for homes late into life when there aren't enough modest-sized homes or aid programs to help afford them?For all of these reasons, we're rapidly approaching a serious clash in America between housing stock and community design on one hand, and demographics on the other.In 1990, less than 5 percent of U.S. counties had a population where adults over 50 made up more than 40 percent of the community (that was 156 counties). By 2010, this was true of 33 percent of all U.S. counties (or 1,031 of them): Harvard JCHS report \"Housing America's Older Adults\"Put another way: The U.S. population over age 65 is expected to include 73 million people by 2030 (that's about 33 million more than today). Where do most of these people currently live? In the suburbs:And in single-family homes:Most of those homes don't have the kind of basic \"universal design\" features that older residents will need, like extra-wide hallways, no-step entries, living spaces on the ground floor, or accessible light switches and door levers. The Harvard report cites 2011 American Housing Survey data concluding that just 1 percent of housing units in America have all five of these features.In theory, such adjustments will mean making homes more accessible for everyone: for dads pushing strollers, children on crutches, anyone who just wants a grandparent to visit. But the prospect of age-proofing our housing stock and neighborhoods raises some thorny policy questions: Should communities require private homeowners or commercial builders to incorporate accessibility features? (Some already do.) Are we willing to invest in transit in communities that currently don't have much of it? Can we make room for \"accessory dwelling units\" — like little backyard cottages where grandma might live — that are currently illegal in many cities?And there's another question not raised by the Harvard report, but it's an equally important one that's been voiced by researcher Arthur C. Nelson: If many Baby Boomers wind up leaving the large single-family homes they've long occupied — where they no longer want to mow the lawn or climb the stairs — will there be enough young homeowners wanting to buy them? America is the midst of shifts in both demographics and housing preferences that suggest there may not be.If you are already worried about what an aging America will mean for entitlement programs, health care spending or the labor pool, you should probably add housing to that list, too.</td>\n",

       "      <td>This week the Silicon Valley-based ride-sharing app Uber announced it was getting a huge new injection of funding. But the money wasn't coming from any of the standard investors from the U.S. tech world.Instead, it was coming from Saudi Arabia.The Saudi state's Public Investment Fund (PIF) was putting $3.5 billion into the company, the largest investment in Uber to date. The move has raised eyebrows, however, due to one of the kingdom's most notorious domestic policies: Saudi Arabia is the only country in the world where women cannot legally drive.While the act of driving for women is not specifically banned, various religious edicts in the country have meant women are restricted from applying for a driving license, effectively making the act of driving illegal for Saudi women. While some women in rural areas do drive without licenses anyway and some women with foreign driving licenses occasionally get behind the wheel (a legal gray area used largely in protest), for the most part women in Saudi Arabia simply don't drive. Polls suggest that support for the policy within the country is mixed.Uber, of course, does not deliberately restrict female drivers. At the end of 2015, the company said that only 19 percent of the drivers using the app were women but that it was actively trying to increase that percentage. The Saudi government will now be given a direct say in Uber's decision making process — PIF was given a seat on the board as part of the deal — but a representative of Uber said that the investment would definitely not limit women drivers on the app in the United States or other countries where women are allowed to drive.What's more complicated, however, is the role that Uber already plays in Saudi Arabia's gender politics. While the country's drivers are almost certainly entirely male, Uber's own figures show their Saudi passengers are more than 80 percent female. For many women in the country, the app and its competitors offer a chance at greater autonomy. Public transportation in Saudi Arabia is largely poor, and it can be difficult to find a regular taxi at times. Many families can't afford to hire a driver to take women places on their own.The end result is that if you are a Saudi woman and you want to commute to work or run errands on your own, a ride-sharing app can become an important tool. “There are some [women] that take five to 10 trips with us every day,” Mudassir Sheikha, the founder of local Uber rival Careem told the Los Angeles Times last year. “We don’t see that kind of traffic anywhere.”Uber has acknowledged the role its app plays in the country, usually portraying it as a strength. In December the company offered free Uber rides to Saudi women during the first election in which they were legally allowed to vote.“Of course we think women should be allowed to drive,” Jill Hazelbaker, an Uber spokeswoman, told the New York Times this week. “In the absence of that, we have been able to provide extraordinary mobility that didn’t exist before — and we’re incredibly proud of that.” It's expected now that the Saudi investment in Uber should end lingering questions about the legality of the service in the country.Yet the company could also be accused of providing a reprieve for the Saudi government from dealing with the issues surrounding female drivers in the country. Members of the Saudi royal family have repeatedly suggested that they believe women should be able to drive — Saudi Arabia’s Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, a powerful voice in the country, recently suggested that \"women don’t get their complete rights granted them by Islam.”Yet no real moves toward lifting the restrictions on female drivers have been seen recently. Crown Prince Mohammed said in April that the country was still \"not convinced about women driving.\"The problem is likely opposition from the Saudi kingdom's powerful religious community, which largely opposes female drivers. While one cleric infamously suggested that driving could damage women's ovaries, many focus on more practical reasons: What happens if a female driver is pulled over by a male cop? Saudi Arabia's religious customs would find this type of interaction between male and female strangers inappropriate (the interaction between Saudi women and male Uber drivers raises fewer eyebrows because it is transactional in nature). Saudi Arabia has announced its intentions to hire more female police officers, but progress remains slow.Meanwhile, public transport projects are also making slim progress. Riyadh's planned metro station is not slated to open until 2018. And while Uber is an option for some women, for many it's still too expensive for any kind of regular use. Some observers wonder if the eventual end of Saudi Arabia's restrictions on female drivers will come from self-driving cars rather than anything else.The Saudi government gets more complicated still when you consider the broader economic factors at play. Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed has become the figurehead of a widely publicized push (dubbed Saudi Vision 2030) to modernize the Saudi economy and end its \"addiction\" to oil. The hope is to diversify the country's business world, using the country's vast wealth it has accumulated over the years to invest in profitable ventures and focusing on underdeveloped industries like tourism and arms.There's a social component at work here, too, most notably in the significant cuts being made to the subsidies given to Saudi citizens. Female citizens are being encouraged to enter the workforce, with Mohammed stating the aim was to increase their participation from 22 percent to 30 percent by 2030. Such moves may soon put the ruling Saudi royals at odds with the country's religious elite, potentially shattering a partnership that has provided relative stability to the country for decades.The investment in Uber seems to be a sign that the Saudi state is willing to bet big on the country's economic future. How those economic bets will translate socially is hard to predict.More on WorldViewsSaudi Arabia announces plan to end its ‘addiction’ to oilThe facts — and a few myths — about Saudi Arabia and human rightsSaudi Arabia’s ‘Islamic military alliance’ against terrorism makes no senseUpdate: This post has been amended to include comment from an Uber representative who said the Saudi investment would not restrict women drivers on the app in the United States or other countries where women can legally drive.</td>\n",

What was once a program providing aid to 1 in 16 Americans is now helping 1 in 8.[How a diet fueled by food stamps is making South Texans obese but leaving them hungry]To be counted, only one individual per household has to be receiving SNAP benefits over the year prior to being surveyed. Here’s a look at what the report’s data show:Yesterday’s high is close to today’s lowIn the year 2000, 10.9 percent of West Virginian households received food stamps—more than any other state. Today, 37 states boast rates above that level.Four states—Wisconsin, Nevada, Michigan and Massachusetts—saw SNAP reliance more than triple by 2013. Another 26 saw rates more than double.Michigan and Oregon posted the largest percentage point increases, with rates up 11.7 points in each. Wyoming has seen food stamp use rise the least, with a mere 0.5 percentage point rise, the only one lacking statistical significance. The rate in Washington, D.C. rose from 8.8 percent in 2000 to 15.7 percent, a 6.9 point rise.In some states, food stamp reliance is approaching 1 in 5Today, the share of households on food stamps is as high as 19.8 percent in Oregon and 19.4 percent in Mississippi and as little as 5.9 percent in Wyoming.Southern states are home to some of the highest rates of food stamp reliance, as the Census Bureau notes. States in the Midwest and West have some of the lowest rates.In 2000, rates were as low as 1 in 25 in several statesNearly half the states in 2000 had SNAP rates below today’s minimum 5.9 percent, with Colorado boasting the lowest rate of 3.3 percent back then.Another 14 states had rates below 5 percent.

       "      <td>AMAZONAS, Brazil – At the base of a towering, 150-foot-high angelim tree, the scattered sloth claws and clumps of fur are a dead giveaway.The tree contains the nest of a harpy eagle, a bird so powerful it kills monkeys and sloths by tearing them from the trees with its enormous claws. Its presence is a good sign to the scientists who are studying the surrounding forest.It means this section of trees and its vast network of life are still healthy enough to support such a high-order predator. And that, in turn, is at least a small bit of good news for the Earth’s climate.Of all the components of the recent Paris accord on climate change, the one that probably got the least attention but could have the most immediate potential involves the world’s forests. In a section some hailed as historic, the document endorsed a United Nations mechanism for wealthier nations to pay developing countries like Brazil for reducing deforestation.Trees are good at keeping carbon out of the air, and simply preserving the planet’s vast forests is a straightforward way to get a huge head start on the business of slowing climate change. But that effort grows tougher every day. After years of progress, deforestation rates have increased recently in Brazil, and deforestation continues apace across much of the global tropics. The economic forces of agriculture and trade remain too strong to resist.Calls for saving rainforests have a long history, but including forests as a core part of the global climate solution is “very very recent,” said Naoko Ishii, CEO of the Global Environment Facility, an international body that invests in restoring tropical forests. “Without taking care of the forests, it’s going to be just impossible to achieve the Paris agreement.”In fact, recent estimates suggest as much as a third of climate emissions could be offset by stopping deforestation and restoring forest land — and that this solution could be achieved much faster than cuts to fossil fuels.Forests are a crucial “carbon sink,” living engines for absorbing and storing carbon. Tropical forests store the most carbon of all, and no tropical forest on Earth is bigger than the Amazon. It accounts for about half of all the carbon these forests store. But the Brazilian Amazon has lost nearly a fifth of its forest cover already — and the forest left behind also suffers because it is more fragmented and less continuous.Thomas Lovejoy, a George Mason University ecologist, has been studying this section of Amazon for decades. While he was encouraged to see the harpy eagle at its nest on a recent afternoon, he was conscious of the forest’s overall fragility.The Amazon system as a whole, Lovejoy said, is at a “precarious point. And you know, the obvious thing is, you don’t want to find out where the tipping point is by tipping it.”Of trees and warming The forest is protected in this roughly 4-square-mile federal research and conservation plot to the northeast of the city of Manaus, where the dark and acidic Rio Negro meets the more brownish Solimões to form the lower Amazon river, the largest in the world.But not far from here, the smell of smoke still hangs over a recently deforested plot – trees slashed down and then burned. So it has gone throughout the Amazon, and far worse in more southern Brazilian states, such as Pará and Mato Grosso.All of which makes the relentless focus on fossil fuels in the climate discussion – and the consigning of forests, at least until now, to a relative side role – somewhat puzzling. Forests, after all, are almost half carbon (if you leave out the water, that is). The billion year old process of photosynthesis stores carbon in the sugars that, in turn, fuel plant growth and metabolism.The storage of carbon is most intense in tropical forests, where a gigantic abundance of different types of trees, thick vines and epiphytes (plants that grow on other plants) are all fighting one another for a slice of direct tropical sunlight – only a sliver of which actually reaches the forest floor. Trees don’t put down very deep roots here; they stretch them outward across the ground, over a layer of often sandy soil that isn’t even very rich or fertile. If the land is cleared, not only is all the carbon lost to the atmosphere, but the result often isn’t even very good farmland or pasture.Net greenhouse gas emissions due to tropical deforestation and forest degradation are about 8 to 15 percent of the global total, which doesn’t sound like that much. But a recent study in Nature Climate Change found that stopping deforestation could nonetheless be a huge piece of the climate solution. That’s because if tropical deforestation stopped, not only would those emissions go away, but on top of that, forests would start stowing away a significant part of the carbon from our fossil fuel emissions.“One could reduce total CO2 emissions by about 30 percent, just working in the land sector,” said Phil Duffy, president of the Woods Hole Research Center. “And that’s a lot.”Moreover, stopping deforestation could buy precious time to ratchet down fossil fuel emissions. “It’s very hard to suddenly convert everyone to electric cars, and power generation is gradually changing, but it’s going to take decades,” said Paul Salaman, CEO of the Rainforest Trust. “But tropical deforestation can literally be stopped point blank with commitment of countries.”Why a fragmented forest stores less carbon What science is revealing, meanwhile, is that it’s not just deforestation itself that’s the problem – it’s also the damage to what’s left behind.Camp 41, which is run collaboratively by Brazil’s National Institute for Amazonian Research and the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute, is a scientific “control” – an example of what happens when you just leave the rainforest alone and let it grow. By contrast, near here are several forest fragments, which Lovejoy helped preserve for research in the late 1970s after the surrounding land was set to be cleared for ranching.The study of these fragments, which has been ongoing since 1980, shows that the forest left behind in the wake of deforestation also suffers greatly.“This project I think more than any other demonstrated that forest fragmentation in patches was a very, very big problem for nature,” said Harvey Locke, a conservationist and writer who visited Camp 41 with Lovejoy in December. “You never hear anybody seriously arguing now that several little patches are better than a big intact block.”Walking through an isolated, nearly 25-acre forest fragment presents a stunning contrast with the forest near the harpy eagle’s angelim tree. In the intact forest, it’s dark and even relatively cool at the forest floor, a simple function of the fact that trees and vines, crowding upward, have managed to claim nearly all of the sunlight.But in the fragment, direct tropical sunlight penetrates much farther, not only from above but from every side. It’s warmer as a result, and also drier – the layer of fallen leaves on the forest floor isn’t wet and spongy, but crunches and crackles as you walk.This environment sustains less life – animals and plants alike. Spider monkeys, which need to range over a huge area, can’t survive in a fragment like this, Lovejoy said. And they’re one food source for the harpy eagle.“Wherever the forest has been altered or compromised, where hunting has reduced prey items, harpys are one of the first to suffer,” said Bret Whitney, a specialist in Brazilian birds and a research associate at Louisiana State University who guided the recent trip to Camp 41 and identified the harpy eagle. “They really require an intact ecosystem to be out there.”“We know that tree mortality went up in this fragment compared to continuous forest,” Lovejoy said. The forest, when fragmented, “becomes simpler,” he said. Winds also blow down more trees in fragments, Lovejoy’s research suggests, another reason that they store less carbon.The punchline, then, isn’t far from that</td>\n",

       "      <td>After a series of explosions rocked the airport and a metro station in Brussels on Tuesday, killing at least 30 and wounding scores of others, city and transit agencies across the U.S. beefed up patrols, taking similar measures to those in the wake of the Paris terror attacks last fall.In New York, counterterrorism resources were deployed to transit hotspots across the city. The New York Police Department said teams were sent to crowded areas and transit stops “out of an abundance of caution.”“At this time, there is no known indication that the attack has any nexus to New York City. We will continue to follow the situation in Belgium closely with the Joint Terrorism Task Force and the FBI and adjust the department’s deployments accordingly,” police spokesman Stephen P. Davis said in a statement.The United States Department of Homeland Security did not heighten its federal threat level, but advised the public to report suspicious activity. Homeland Security Secretary Jeh C. Johnson said in a statement that “additional security” would be deployed at major city airports and rail and transit stations across the country.New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) directed state officials to step up patrols at heavily traveled locations around the state, including bridges, tunnels, airports and mass transit systems, he said.“Public safety is paramount, and I want the people of this state to know that we are working with all local and federal partners, remaining vigilant and taking all necessary measures to keep New Yorkers safe,” he said in a statement.At JFK International Airport, New York National Guard forces were providing additional security detail. The Guard deployed 400 service members across the New York City area Tuesday, Cuomo said. They focused increased patrols on transportation hubs such as JFK and LaGuardia Airports. In addition, New York State Troopers were monitoring Penn Station and Grand Central Station as well as the Queens-Midtown Tunnel and George Washington Bridge. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey stepped up its police presence at airports, bridges, tunnels and the World Trade Center complex, Cuomo said. And the Metropolitan Transit Auhtority was upping patrols across the system.In Washington, Metro Transit Police advised passengers to remain vigilant. The agency said it would conduct additional K9 sweeps and patrols across the system Tuesday morning as a precaution, but that no “known, specific or credible threat” existed. Alexandria Deputy Police Chief Shahram Fard said in a Tweet that Alexandria Police patrol officers were assisting Metro Transit Police in monitoring Metro parking lots, and it was expected that agencies across the region would aid in the security effort.Internationally, the attacks led to the cancellation of hundreds of flights — mostly in and out of Brussels Airport — which closed Tuesday. Brussels Airlines had cancelled 203 flights by Tuesday afternoon, according to the Flight tracking website flightaware.com.On U.S. airlines, the site said, flights with Brussels on their itinerary were canceled. They included: A United Airlines flight bound for Dulles International Airport that was scheduled to leave Brussels at 7:10 a.m. Eastern Time on Tuesday, along with three other United flights; six Delta Airlines flights and two American Airlines flights — one bound for Philadelphia and another departing from there for the Belgian capital.American Airlines spokesman Kent Powell said the airline has made accommodations for passengers with reservations to Brussels, and arrangements would be made for those who remain in Belgium. Flights to and from Brussels were canceled through Thursday, he said. American’s next flight to Brussels is scheduled to depart Philadelphia on Friday evening, while its next flight from Brussels back to the U.S. is scheduled to leave the Belgian capital at 9:40 Saturday morning.“American Airlines is taking care of our employees and customers in Brussels after this morning’s events. At this time, there are no reported injuries to our employees. American Airlines check-in operates at Row 8 of the departure hall, and the explosions did not occur at Row 8,” Powell said. “American Airlines flight 751 from Brussels to Philadelphia has been canceled for today. When operations at the Brussels airport resume, we will reaccommodate our customers. We have issued a travel policy for customers with reservations to Brussels who wish to change their itineraries.”The Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority did not outline specific steps that were being taken at the region’s two major airports, Dulles International and Reagan National airports, but a statement reinforced the airports’ commitment to passenger safety. The statement encouraged passengers to stay vigilant and report any unusual activity.“Reagan National and Dulles International airports have a robust security structure, both publicly visible and behind the scenes,” the statement read. “We constantly train our employees and evaluate our security procedures, in collaboration with our federal partners and local mutual aid partners, to make adjustments, updates and enhancements based on new information and situations.”Officials at Baltimore Washington International Airport said they were “working closely” with federal and state law enforcement agencies after the Brussels attacks, but that no specific threat existed.Maryland officials said Tuesday that travelers should expect to see more police and canine explosive detection patrols throughout the state’s transportation network.“In the wake of the horrific attacks today in Belgium, we are taking every precaution to keep Maryland citizens safe and secure,” Gov. Larry Hogan (R) said in a statement. “In particular, there will be a more visible law enforcement presence at the airport, train stations and other mass transit locations around the state. I encourage all Marylanders, especially those traveling, to remain vigilant and aware of their surroundings at all times. If you see something unusual or unsettling, please report it immediately.”Transportation Secretary Pete K. Rahn said two pre-established law enforcement plans for the MTA Police and the Maryland Transportation Authority Police would be implemented.“In addition to the increased enforcement you do see, there are many measures in place that travelers won’t see,” Rahn said. “Please be aware of your surroundings and remember: ‘If you see something, say something.’ ”In Chicago, extra officers and canine units were dispatched to the airports and Chicago Transit Authority stations stations as a precaution, the Chicago Tribune reported. A police spokesman told the paper that the interim police superintendent has ordered “stepped-up presence at airports and transportation sites within Chicago.”In Los Angeles, the county sheriff’s transit police swept Union Station, the downtown train station, and heightened security at other transit hubs, according to the Los Angeles Times. Security would be increased at several of the city’s major metro stations, a spokesman told the paper.At Los Angeles International Airport, officers would be making their presence known more than usual, an airport police officer told the paper.And in San Francisco, there would be an increased uniform police presence at “key locations” across the Bay Area Rapid Transit system, said spokeswoman Alicia Trost. The system was also sending out a “See Something, Say Something” memo to passengers through its safety and security app BART Watch.Lori Aratani and Ashley Halsey III contributed to this post.</td>\n",

As of June 2016, women’s membership in parliament doubled from 11.3 percent in 1995 to 22.1 percent in 2015, according to a recent study by the Inter-Parliamentary Union.And this year alone, there have been many historic firsts.In Iran, women won 17 seats during the Islamic Republic’s parliamentary elections in February. “This is a record and we are happy that our dear women are taking part in all stages, especially in politics,” Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said in a speech back in May.Africa has had some of the most dramatic breakthroughs over the past 20 years. As of June, four African nations were part of the top 10 as far as the number of women represented in parliament. Rwanda, for example, tops the chart as the country with the highest number of women represented in parliament in both the lower (63.8 percent) and upper houses (38.5 percent) in 2016.But women remain a relatively small group in parliaments around the world, and progress is slow. Data from the IPU shows that in a vast majority of countries, men still dominate the political stage. In both the lower and upper houses combined, women around the world account for around 22 percent of seats held in parliament.\"Yes it is an improvement considering that it started at a low base,\" Executive Director of U.N. Women Phumzile Mlambo Ngcuka said. \"But if we continue at this pace, it's going to take us too long. We need to fast-track the attainment of gender equality.\"The U.S. is one country that lags the global average of women in the national legislature. It ranks behind 95 countries, including low- and middle-income countries such as Ethiopia, El Salvador and Suriname. Other countries that outperform the United States include Iraq, Afghanistan and Saudi Arabia.One way that countries have been fast-tracking female participation in politics is through gender quotas, and the results have left many surprised. Countries that that have relatively low socioeconomic development or have just emerged from conflict, such as Afghanistan, Tanzania and Ecuador, have shown tremendous improvement and have higher levels of female representation in parliaments.Jennifer Rosen, assistant professor of sociology at Pepperdine University, says emerging democracies give leaders a unique opportunity for leaders to enshrine gender quotas in their new constitutions, helping bypass cultural barriers that would have otherwise stood in the way of women participating in politics for many years.Different electoral systems also influence women's participation in parliament. While scholars agree that proportional representation systems, which allow people to vote for a party list rather than a particular candidate, have a positive influence on female representation in government, some are divided as to whether it has a positive impact on all countries or only on Western democracies.One way for countries to shift their mentalities is to encourage people in executive leadership positions to set an example, Rosen said. Ngcuka, the U.N. women executive director, agrees and said men play an important role and that women shouldn't be the only ones trying to \"move the glass ceiling,\" noting how attitudes change when influential leaders such as Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau nominated a cabinet in 2015 that was half-female.Political parties that are supposed to provide gender quotas need to ensure that they place women in winnable positions, IPU Secretary General Martin Chungong said. \"In many instances they are not walking the walk,\" he said. \"It's not enough to have quotas. We need to provide incentives for people who don't want to implement them.\"What's also clear is that having women in national legislatures can change the way a country is governed. Research shows that when women participate in politics, the conversation gets steered toward issues that their male counterparts often fail to address, such as family planning, education and gender-based violence.\"We have seen that there are certain issues women are better able to articulate,\" Chungong said. \"Women tend to take leading roles not because it is a women's issue, but because it has to do with livelihood of society as a whole.\" More on WorldViewsThe world is getting better at paid maternity leave.

       "      <td>We’ve all heard the complaint or something like it: “I’ve been staring at the screen all day. My eyes hurt.” But is it really the screen’s fault? (And if so, is there any long- or short-term damage?) Would our eyes be any better off perusing printed pages all day?Yes, you can blame the screen, but not for everything. Some of the same eye-care advice you’ll hear for computer screens apply to paper-bookworms, too.Screen-induced eye strain has an official name, if not a surprising one: computer vision syndrome. The term emerged about 20 years ago and describes a host of bothersome symptoms, including eye fatigue, burning and itchy eyes, blurred vision and sensitivity to bright light. People who spend two or more continuous hours at a computer every day are at greatest risk for developing the syndrome, according to the American Optometric Association.For most people, symptom treatment is enough — managing their reading position, taking rest breaks or using eye drops to relieve dry eyes. That said, dry and irritated eyes are associated with disorders of the cornea, the transparent layer at the front of the eye. See a doctor if you’re putting drops in your eyes five or six times a day and still feel like they’re dry, says James Salz, a University of Southern California eye doctor and spokesperson for the American Academy of Ophthalmology. Still, he adds, “there’s no evidence that there’s any long-term damage from reading on a screen.”What is it about computers that irritates our eyes? The problem boils down to a couple of key factors:Blinking. Study after study has found that when reading on screens people tend to stare more than they do when reading on a printed page. More staring means less blinking, which means your eyes get less refreshment from tears. “When you blink, you spread a layer of tears over the eye,” says Mark Rosenfield, a professor at the State University of New York College of Optometry. With less blinking, eyes get dry and sore.Another difference between the printed page and the computer screen is where the words are positioned relative to the eyes. People generally look down while reading a book or newspaper, but staring at screen usually means staring straight ahead. When you look down, more of your eye is covered by the eyelid, but when you look straight ahead more of your eye is exposed to the drying effect of air. Coupled with reduced blinking, this leads to dry eyes. Reading on mobile devices may be more book-like in terms of positioning, but blink rate is still a concern.A small 2013 study found that when reading print on paper or e-ink (the technology that attempts to replicate as closely as possible the printed page experience, Kindle paperwhite in this study), the subjects — 12 men who read for at least an hour on each device — blinked more often when reading on paper or e-ink than they did when looking at an LCD screen (a tablet with its own light supply, the Kindle Fire here). Participants also reported more visual fatigue after reading on the LCD; fatigue rates on e-ink and paper were equivalent. Distance. Not surprisingly, people reading on their smartphones tend to hold the device much closer to their eyes than they would a book or magazine. In a 2011 study, Rosenfield found that the 219 participants held their phones 14 inches from their eyes to read text messages and 12?1 / 2 inches for a Web page. Typically, people read printed text from a distance of 15?3 / 4 inches.The result is that “your eye has to work much harder to focus at close distances,” Rosenfield says. The eyes turn in more (not quite cross-eyed) and that takes effort. Over time, that can lead to fatigue.Moreover, if you’re of a certain age, that focusing effort becomes even harder. At about age 40, natural changes in the eye’s focal length means most people can’t see closely as well. That’s when you start holding the restaurant menu at an arm’s length to read.Other considerations are resolution, brightness, and glare, says Alan Hedge, a professor of ergonomics at Cornell University. “The resolution of print on paper is higher than any screen out there.” Brightness should be adjusted for comfort, either on your screen or the lamp by your reading chair. As for glare, it is easier to read a book or an e-ink on an e-reader in the sunshine. But if you’re reading late at night in bed, you might prefer the backlit screen of a tablet.The good thing about electronic reading is that you can change so many things to make the experience more comfortable, such as increasing the size of the text and fiddling with the brightness, which can also help you keep the words at a distance. Salz says 18 inches is ideal.Common sense goes a long way too, Salz says. “As soon as you feel fatigue, look away.”Indeed, workplace advice for people who read on computers for a large part of their days, comes in the 20-20-20 rule: Every 20 minutes, look 20 feet away for 20 seconds.So good for us: A new excuse to gaze out the window.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Super Typhoon Vongfong has rapidly intensified over the past 24 hours, from the equivalent of a category two hurricane to a monster typhoon with 155 mph wind speeds, and an estimated central pressure of 908 millibars.Based on satellite estimates of central pressure, Vongfong is now the most intense storm on Earth so far in 2014, and forecast models suggest it could rival the intensity of deadly Typhoon Haiyan of 2013 over the next 24 hours.During the 24 hours between Monday and Tuesday mornings, Vongfong ballooned from wind speeds of 89 mph to 168 mph, based on satellite estimates. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center estimates that Typhoon Vongfong has maximum winds of 155 mph on Tuesday morning, though this is likely a conservative estimate.Vongfong is now the sixth super typhoon of 2014, with winds speeds over 150 mph.The Joint Typhoon Warning Center points to a favorable environment for the cause of the rapid intensification, including low wind shear and excellent outflow, which helps to ventilate and strengthen the storm.Forecast models are suggesting that the super typhoon could continue to intensify, tanking to 895 millibars — a typhoon intensity not seen since Typhoon Haiyan in 2013, which killed over 6,000 people. A pressure that low would beat this year’s second most intense storm — Typhoon Genevieve — by 20 millibars.Luckily, this monster storm is not expected to make landfall while it’s at such high intensity. Over the next 24 to 48 hours, Vongfong is forecast to make a sharp turn north toward Japan. By Saturday morning, the typhoon is forecast to weaken to the equivalent of a category three, and then a category two with wind speeds of 105 mph, as it approaches the southern islands of the Kagoshima Prefecture of Japan.Beyond this, global forecast models are suggesting Vongfong will continue to turn northeast and potentially making landfall in the southern Japan mainland, which will undoubtedly bring torrential rain to a region already soaked from Typhoon Phanfone.</td>\n",

       "      <td>This story and its headline have been been updated, with \"alarming\" being changed to \"striking.\" See below for more details.Critics of the fast-food industry have long warned about the perils of our addiction to processed food. Big Macs and Whoppers might taste good, but put too many of them in your body and it will expand as Violet Beauregard's did in Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory (although maybe not quite as fast). The evidence is decades in the making. The rise of processed food, after all, has coincided with an alarming growth in the size of our collective gut.But there might be some new powerful ammunition for those who could do without the food the fast-food industry serves.Researchers at George Washington University have linked fast-food consumption to the presence of potentially harmful chemicals, a connection they argue could have \"great public health significance.\" Specifically, the team found that people who eat fast food tend to have significantly higher levels of certain phthalates, which are commonly used in consumer products such as soap and makeup to make them less brittle but have been linked to a number of adverse health outcomes, including higher rates of infertility, especially among males.The danger, the researchers believe, isn't necessarily a result of the food itself, but rather the process by which the food is prepared. The findings were published in Environmental Health Perspectives, a journal funded by the National Institutes of Health.\"We're not trying to create paranoia or anxiety, but I do think our findings are alarming,\" said one of the study's authors, Ami Zota, an assistant professor of environmental and occupational health at George Washington University. \"It's not every day that you conduct a study where the results are this strong.\"(Update: A few hours after publication, Zota called to say that in reading her quote she felt that the word \"alarming\" was too strong a word to use to describe her findings. Rather, she said \"striking\" was more appropriate, because it conveys the magnitude of the findings without assigning a sense of urgency.)Fast-food nationIn order to gauge how fast food affects the presence of certain non-natural chemicals, the team analyzed data for nearly 9,000 people. The data was collected as part of federal nutrition surveys conducted between 2003 and 2010. The surveys included detailed information about the participants' diets, including what each had eaten in the last 24 hours. They also contained the results of urine samples taken at the same time, which allowed the researchers to measure the levels of three separate chemicals.For the purpose of the study, any food eaten at or from restaurants without waiters or waitresses was considered fast food. Everything else — food eaten at sit-down restaurants and bars or purchased from supermarkets and vending machines — was not.The first thing the researchers found was that roughly one-third of the participants said they had eaten some form of fast food over the course of the day leading up to the urine sample collection. That proportion, high as it might seem, is actually in line with government estimates. In fact, more than a third of all children and adolescents living in the country still eat some form of fast food on any given day, a number that hasn't budged in decades, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.The second thing the researchers found is that those participants who said they had eaten fast food in the last 24 hours tended to have much higher levels of two separate phthalates — DEHP and DiNP. People who reported eating only a little fast food had DEHP levels that were 15.5 percent higher and DiNP levels that were 25 percent higher than those who said they had eaten none. For people who reported eating a sizable amount, the increase was 24 percent and 39 percent, respectively.And the connection held true even after the researchers adjusted for various factors about the participants' habits and backgrounds that might have contributed to the association between fast-food consumption and phthalate levels.\"We looked at it in so many different ways, and the effect still remains,\" said Zota.The problem with these chemicalsThere is little consensus on the harms of phthalates, which are widely used in commerce and give materials such as food packaging added flexibility, except that exposure to them \"is widespread.\" But there is growing concern that the chemicals could pose a variety of risks, particularly when observed in the sort of levels seen in the study.\"There's a vast amount of scientific evidence suggesting certain phthalates can contribute to several adverse health effects,\" said Zota.A 2012 study found a strong association between the presence of DEHP and diabetes. A 2013 study found that exposure to the industrial chemical can increase the risk of various allergic diseases in children. And a 2016 study concluded that it can also negatively affect child behavior.While there is less evidence that DiNP is problematic, some recent research suggests it very well could be. A study undertaken last year, for instance, found that exposure to the phthalate was associated with higher blood pressure.For these reasons, many governments have moved to limit exposure to the industrial chemicals. Japan disallowed the use of vinyl gloves in food preparation for fear that their use was compromising health. The European Union, which limits the use of the chemical, has been nudging manufacturers to replace it. And the United States restricted its use in toys. In fact, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services warned that DEHP is \"reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen.\"To fear or not to fearThe reason people who eat fast food seem to have much higher levels of potentially harmful industrial chemicals is unclear. But it's easy enough to guess: the sheer amount of processing that goes into food served at quick-service restaurants.The more machinery, plastic, conveyor belts, and various forms of processing equipment that food touches, the more likely the food is to contain higher levels of phthalates. And fast food tends to touch a good deal more of these things than, say, the food one purchases at a local farmers market.\"I really hope this study helps raise public awareness about the exposure problems associated with our industrialized food system,\" said Zota.Considering the prevalence of packaged food — and widespread exposure to phthalates (they can be detected in more than 98 percent of the population, per the CDC) — however, the takeaway isn't necessarily that fast food is toxic. Fast food, after all, isn't the only culprit here. Nor are less healthful things in general.\"It’s not fair to say, 'Oh, these exposures only happen if you eat unhealthy foods,'\" Leo Trasande, an associate professor of pediatrics, environmental medicine and population health at New York University, told Bloomberg.Anything that's gone through some form of processing or industrial packaging is vulnerable.Still, given the new study's findings, it certainly seems as though eating fast food is more toxic than avoiding it, and not for the obvious reasons. Perhaps that's something many would have expected to hear, but it doesn't make it any less true.\"Traditional fast food was never meant to be daily fare, and it shouldn’t be,\" said Marion Nestle, who is the Paulette Goddard professor of nutrition and food Studies at New York University. \"It’s too high in calories and salt and, as we now know, the chemicals that get into our food supply through industrial food production.\"Like our Health &amp; Wellness page on Facebook for more science news about the ins and outs of the human body and mind, essays and advice.

       "      <td>Correction: An earlier version of this story included Goldman Sachs among companies that industry sources say have traded “renewable identification number” certificates, or RINs. A Goldman spokesman says the firm has not traded RINs for itself or on behalf of clients. This version has been corrected.The “now hiring” sign is up online for Emmetsburg, Iowa, where the nation’s largest maker of ethanol used for motor fuel is putting the final touches on a manufacturing plant that will rely not on corn, but on the stalks and cobs left behind.The company, Poet, is looking for an accountant, electricians, lab technicians, a supervisor for starch and cellulose operations, and more. Large flatbed trucks have already dropped off 2,600 tons of big bales at the distillery’s 22-acre stack yard. Equipment is visible from miles away across the flat, open prairie. The process is a bit like making moonshine on an industrial scale, helped along by some high-tech, bioengineered enzymes.“My gosh, it’s been a boon for everybody,” said Myrna Heddinger, a retired nurse serving her third term as the mayor of Emmetsburg, a town of 3,500 people that has squeezed in 500 temporary construction workers. “We just don’t have that many places for people to rent to stay,” she added.Poet and its joint venture partner, the Dutch industrial giant and enzyme maker DSM, have received $100 million in Energy Department grants and $20 million in financial incentives from the state of Iowa. They say they expect to begin production of ethanol at the Emmetsburg plant in early 2014, at a rate of about 20 million gallons a year.Not a moment too soon. For months, a brawl has been brewing in Washington over the future of ethanol plants like this one, pitting well-financed oil giants against trade groups and companies representing the politically well-connected biofuel industry.The heart of the dispute is the Energy Independence and Security Act passed by Congress in 2007 with rare bipartisan support. The law provided a road map for increasing the use of renewable agricultural byproducts in the U.S. motor fuel supply. The Poet plant is just what Congress envisioned, a Middle America biofuel displacing Middle East crude — with some possible climate benefits to boot.Corn-based ethanol, which makes up nearly 10 percent of U.S. motor fuel, has been in large-scale production for years. But Congress was worried about driving up the price of corn used as feed for livestock and poultry. So lawmakers capped the total production of corn-based ethanol and set a schedule for ramping up the use of “advanced” biofuels made from corn husks, switch grass, wood chips and other stuff known as “cellulosic” material to 16 billion gallons by 2022.There’s one problem, though: So far, no company has produced cellulosic ethanol at commercial volumes.A slower-than-expected startCongress assumed that it could be phased in gradually, but not this gradually. This year refiners were supposed to mix about one billion gallons of it into motor fuel. So far, there has been hardly a drop. More than a dozen companies have tried and failed to find a profitable formula combining sophisticated enzymes and the mundane but costly and labor-intensive job of collecting biomass.Congress had the foresight to provide a safety valve. The Environmental Protection Agency, using its authority under the 2007 law, slashed the cellulosic ethanol quota this year, first to a paltry 14 million gallons and then again to 6 million, equal to about 0.004 percent of the fuel consumed by U.S. automobiles. It also extended the deadline for compliance. The EPA is widely expected to announce minimal quotas for next year soon, too. Oil industry lobbyists believe the EPA will also, for the first time, trim the minimum quotas for corn-based ethanol, angering farm interests and big corn-ethanol producers.The shortfall in cellulosic ethanol output has helped trigger high costs for some oil refiners under an arcane enforcement scheme that has the oil industry screaming — and lobbying — for congressional and regulatory relief. Ashley M. Smith, vice president for investor relations for Valero, the nation’s biggest oil refiner, said during an Oct. 29 conference call with analysts that the company expects to spend $500 million to $600 million this year to buy certificates to comply with the program.The American Petroleum Institute, a trade group for the nation’s oil and gas industry, says that petroleum refiners shouldn’t have to wait for the EPA to amend the targets every year. It wants the mandates — known as the Renewable Fuel Standard — abolished so that refiners don’t pay penalties for failing to comply. The API has wallpapered billboards, Web sites and subway systems with ads. It has lobbied key members of Congress. And it has filed a lawsuit against what it called an “unrealistic mandate.”“Our bottom line is that the RFS must be stopped once and for all,” said Bob Greco, API’s director of upstream and industry operations. He said the standard was “simply broken.”William R. Klesse, chief executive of Valero, which is also the nation’s third-largest cornethanol producer, wrote to EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy in September saying that cellulosic ethanol “is still basically nonexistent with only small volumes expected.” He said Congress “should develop an alternate RFS that encourages the development of the business, but also represents the real world.”The ethanol industry has fired back that the oil companies’s real agenda is to prevent a new industry from competing for space in American fuel tanks. They charge that oil firms fear losing even a 1 percent share of the roughly $450 billion-a-year gasoline market, especially since U.S. gasoline consumption peaked in 2005 and has been falling as a result of higher fuel-efficiency standards for new American cars.“We would never have invested the amount of money we’ve done without a clear framework like the one the RFS is providing. It is absolutely critical,” said Manuel Sánchez Ortega, the chief executive of Spanish engineering giant Abengoa, which is finishing a cellulosic ethanol plant in Hugoton, Kan. Repealing the RFS, he added, “would be somehow misleading to the investment community.”Rep. John Shimkus (R-Ill.), a senior member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, is one target of lobbying groups. The goals set by Congress in 2007 were “just too aggressive,” he said during a September meeting with reporters organized by Platts, an energy newsletter. But, he added, “there are people who’ve made major investments. You’re talking billions of dollars. .?.?. So what kind of signal are you sending” by changing the RFS? “That kind of scares me,” he said.The industry takes offThe fight is coming to a head just as the first well-financed, truly commercial-size cellulosic ethanol plants are poised to come onstream. These ventures, while behind schedule, aren’t start-ups, and the companies behind them have the financial muscle to push ahead. Dupont is close to completing a plant in the town of Nevada, Iowa, that will produce 30 million gallons a year. Abengoa, the Spanish multinational energy, engineering and construction firm with more than 22,000 employees worldwide, says its Kansas plant will start up by early next year and produce 25 million gallons a year. It has been signing 10-year contracts with farmers within a 50-mile radius to buy biomass.Poet and DSM expect to begin production in Emmetsburg in early 2014 at a rate of about 20 million gallons a year. Poet, which is the country’s biggest corn-based ethanol producer, has worked on cellulosic technology since 2001. The plant is located next to a Poet corn-ethanol plant, so that it can draw on the same farmers for raw material.“You’ve got $1 billion plus of investment in steel, and people don’t put that kind of money in just for fun,” said Adam Monroe, president of Novozymes America, the subsidiary of a Danish company that makes enzymes used to convert plant</td>\n",

The accelerator abruptly stopped working. The car crawled to a stop. As 18-wheelers whizzed by his stalled vehicle, Greenberg began to panic.His car hadn’t spun out on black ice, however. It hadn’t been hit by another vehicle or experienced engine trouble.It had been hacked.[Hacks on the highway: Automakers rush to add wireless features, leaving our cars open to hackers]Greenberg, a senior writer for Wired magazine, had asked Charlie Miller and Chris Valasek — two “white hat” or altruistic hackers — to show him what they could do.So, while Greenberg drove down the highway, Miller and Valasek sat on Miller’s couch 10 miles away and played God.“Though I hadn’t touched the dashboard, the vents in the Jeep Cherokee started blasting cold air at the maximum setting, chilling the sweat on my back through the in-seat climate control system,” Greenberg wrote. “Next the radio switched to the local hip hop station and began blaring Skee-lo at full volume.

Then the windshield wipers turned on, and wiper fluid blurred the glass.“As I tried to cope with all this, a picture of the two hackers performing these stunts appeared on the car’s digital display: Charlie Miller and Chris Valasek, wearing their trademark track suits.

I need to move,” Greenberg said, pleading for the hackers to return power to the vehicle.Greenberg survived to tell his tale, of course, but the ordeal is just the latest in a series of incidents highlighting the startling security vulnerabilities of hundreds of thousands of American automobiles.These incidents have raised the specter of remote-controlled car accidents, in which anarchist hackers or computer-savvy assassins could still be at home in their pajamas while wreaking havoc.On Tuesday, just hours after Wired published its story, Sens. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) and Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) unveiled a bill aimed at keeping Internet-connected cars from getting hacked.“Rushing to roll out the next big thing, automakers have left cars unlocked to hackers and data-trackers,” Blumenthal said.“Controlled demonstrations show how frightening it would be to have a hacker take over controls of a car,” Markey said in a statement to Wired. “Drivers shouldn’t have to choose between being connected and being protected…We need clear rules of the road that protect cars from hackers and American families from data trackers.”[Next dashboard warning may be, ‘Your car has been hacked!’]Even the hackers themselves were taken aback by their abilities.“When I saw we could do it anywhere, over the Internet, I freaked out,” Valasek told Wired. “I was frightened. It was like, holy f—, that’s a vehicle on a highway in the middle of the country. Car hacking got real, right then.” The problem is one of our own creation.Like thousands of other everyday devices, from coffeemakers to power plants, cars are increasingly connected to the Internet. This enables drivers to stream music, watch videos and use GPS.But it also exposes their cars — and therefore the drivers as well — to hackers.Miller and Valasek exploited a weak spot in Uconnect, an Internet-connected feature on as many as 471,000 Fiat Chrysler late-model automobiles, most of them in the United States. Using a laptop computer and a burner phone, they were able to send a series of commands to the car.“Uconnect computers are linked to the Internet by Sprint’s cellular network, and only other Sprint devices can talk to them,” Greenberg explained. By connecting a phone to his laptop, Miller was able to use the phone as a Wi-Fi hot spot and search Sprint’s entire 3G network for hack-able cars.[Hackers warned senators of the Internet’s vulnerabilities back in 1998, but were ignored]Not only does the computer weakness allow hackers to manipulate the locks and turn off the engine, it also enables them to cut the brakes. They can even take over the steering wheel if the car is in reverse.“From an attacker’s perspective, it’s a super nice vulnerability,” Miller told Greenberg.The stunt seems to confirm fears that have worried security experts for several years now. In 2011, researchers at the University of Washington and the University of California at San Diego proved they could remotely disable a car’s locks and brakes.While the researchers didn’t reveal the car manufacturer, Miller and Valasek have made no secret that their hack affects cars made by Fiat Chrysler.Before going public with the news, however, the hackers took their findings to the company. Chrysler has recently released a patch to prevent such hacking.“[Fiat Chrysler Automobiles] has a program in place to continuously test vehicles systems to identify vulnerabilities and develop solutions,” the company said in a statement sent to WIRED. “FCA is committed to providing customers with the latest software updates to secure vehicles against any potential vulnerability.”“Patch your Chrysler vehicle before hackers kill you,” warned Fox News on Wednesday after Wired published its article.Thanks to Miller and Valasek, Chrysler drivers can now guard against such invasions. But the Uconnect weakness is only the tip of an Internet security iceberg. There are many other ways that a car can be compromised by hackers.Other brands, for example, might not be any safer.“I don’t think there are qualitative differences in security between vehicles today,” UCSD computer science professor Stefan Savage told Wired. “The Europeans are a little bit ahead. The Japanese are a little bit behind. But broadly writ, this is something everyone’s still getting their hands around.”In February, hackers demonstrated to NBC 4 in New York how they could override a car’s system using a tiny Wi-Fi dongle plugged underneath its steering wheel.[FBI probe of alleged plane hack sparks worries over flight safety]Other successful attacks have involved “infecting the computers in the repair shop and then having that infection spread to the car through the diagnostic port, or hacking in through the Bluetooth system, or using the telematics unit that’s normally used to provide roadside assistance,” Kathleen Fisher from the federal Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), told NBC.Car makers have been slow to respond to criticism from researchers or hackers like Miller and Valasek.“There is a clear lack of appropriate security measures to protect drivers against hackers who may be able to take control of a vehicle or against those who may wish to collect and use personal driver information,” according to a study compiled by Markey and released in February.The study, “Tracking &amp; Hacking: Security &amp; Privacy Gaps Put American Drivers at Risk,” found, among other things, that:Nearly 100% of cars on the market include wireless technologies that could pose vulnerabilities to hacking or privacy intrusions. Most automobile manufacturers were unaware of or unable to report on past hacking incidents. Security measures to prevent remote access to vehicle electronics are inconsistent and haphazard across all automobile manufacturers, and many manufacturers did not seem to understand the questions posed by Senator Markey. Only two automobile manufacturers were able to describe any capabilities to diagnose or meaningfully respond to an infiltration in real-time, and most say they rely on technologies that cannot be used for this purpose at all.The security shortcomings exposed by Miller, Valasek and others are especially worrying as fully automated cars appear on the horizon.Imagine laying back in your fully automated car on your way to work when someone at a Starbucks miles away takes control and sends your robotic car swerving into oncoming traffic</td>\n",

       "      <td>Old guideline: Restrict cholesterol intake to 300 milligrams daily.2015 guideline: No limit is included, but \"this change does not suggest that dietary cholesterol is no longer important to consider when building healthy eating patterns. ... Individuals should eat as little dietary cholesterol as possible.\"Cholesterol warnings have been around in the United States since at least 1961 and have helped shift eating habits from foods like eggs. But scientific thinking on the issue has evolved.Nutritionists now believe that foods high in cholesterol may not significantly affect cholesterol levels or increase the risk of heart disease in healthy adults. But individuals with health issues such as diabetes should continue to avoid cholesterol-rich foods.The government's new stance on dietary cholesterol is in line with that of other nations, which do not single out cholesterol as an issue. Yet it should not be confused with officials' continued warning about high levels of \"bad\" cholesterol in the blood -- something that has been clearly linked to heart disease.Experts emphasize that while the hard limit on cholesterol consumption was removed, that doesn't mean a green light to eat cholesterol-laden foods with abandon.\"Cautions about cholesterol intake are addressed in the text of the [guideline] report, including a clear statement that people do not need to obtain cholesterol through food and should limit their intake of cholesterol and saturated fat as much as possible through healthy eating patterns,\" American College of Cardiology President Kim Allan Williams said.[Cholesterol in the Diet: The Long Slide from Public Menace to No “Appreciable” Effect]Williams explained that Americans can meet these recommendations by eating more unprocessed foods -- especially fruits, vegetables and whole grains -- and by replacing unwanted sugar and fat with plant-based foods, including whole grains, fruits and vegetables.The federal government's influential Dietary Guidelines for Americans, which were released Thursday, are updated every five years, and the debate over saturated fats, red meat, caffeine and salt was especially intense this time around.The guidelines are the basis of everything from school lunch programs to the diets promoted in bestselling books, but in recent years some scientists have begun to question the one-size-fits-all approach. A growing body of research supports the theory that a person's genetic makeup or microbiome (the organisms that live on or inside of you and help to make you who you are) plays a key role in how food affects the body -- and that the impact can be different from one individual to another. That work supports a more personalized approach to diet, which some researchers argue have argued is the future of nutrition science.Read more:This diet study upends everything we thought we knew about ‘healthy’ foodCutting sugar from kids’ diets appears to have a beneficial effect in just 10 daysScientists (sort of) settle debate on low-carb vs. low-fat dietsDoritos, deconstructed (mesmerizing photos of the 34 processed ingredients in your favorite snack)Hot topic: Could regularly eating spicy foods help you live longer?For more health news, you can sign up for our weekly newsletter here.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Washington Post reporter Jason Rezaian and his family filed a federal lawsuit Monday against the Iranian government, claiming he was taken hostage and psychologically tortured during his 18 months in prison in an effort by Tehran to influence negotiations for a nuclear agreement with Iran.The suit, filed in U.S. District Court in the District of Columbia, says Rezaian was targeted for arrest to gain advantage in a prisoner exchange and to “extort” concessions from the U.S. government in the multinational talks over lifting sanctions if Iran agreed to limits on its nuclear program.Iranian officials repeatedly told Rezaian and his wife, Yeganeh Salehi, who also was detained for more than two months, that Rezaian had “value” as a bargaining chip for a prisoner swap, the suit says. The filing also links key moments in the nuclear negotiations to Rezaian’s treatment in the judicial system, from arrest to conviction to sentencing, and ultimately his release on the day the deal was implemented.“For nearly eighteen months, Iran held and terrorized Jason for the purpose of gaining negotiating leverage and ultimately exchanging him with the United States for something of value to Iran,” the suit states.Rezaian; his brother, Ali Rezaian; and their mother, Mary Rezaian, are asking for an unspecified sum for damages under the “terrorism exception” to the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act. That law generally bars U.S. citizens from suing foreign governments in domestic courts, but exceptions are made for terrorist acts, torture or hostage-taking by countries, including Iran, that the State Department has designated as state sponsors of terrorism. The suit accuses Iran of all three.Rezaian and Salehi, who was born in Iran and married Rezaian there, were arrested on July 22, 2014, by Iranian agents wearing surgical masks who forced their way into the couple’s apartment and took them for questioning at Evin prison, a notorious site for political prisoners. Salehi was freed 71 days later on a $32,000 bail provided by her brother-in-law, Ali.Rezaian was eventually tried and convicted on espionage and related charges, according to Iranian state media accounts. But the Iranian government has never officially disclosed the specifics of his conviction in a closed-door trial or the sentence imposed by a judge known for meting out harsh punishments.The lawsuit provides details of Rezaian’s incarceration that had never before been publicly revealed.Both Rezaian and Salehi were repeatedly subjected to psychological and physical abuse during lengthy interrogations, the suit says. Their captors at turns threatened to dismember or execute them. Interrogated in isolation and often deprived of sleep, each also was warned that the other might be maimed or executed, and that the same fate could befall other family members in Iran, according to the filing.The ordeal was so intense that Rezaian, Salehi and Rezaian’s brother, Ali, all contemplated suicide, the suit says. Now — almost nine months after Rezaian and four other U.S. citizens were released on the day the nuclear deal was implemented — Salehi, the Rezaian brothers and their mother are still afflicted with trauma and guilt, according to the suit.“For 544 days, Jason suffered such physical mistreatment and severe psychological abuse in Evin Prison that he will never be the same,” the suit states. “He will require specialized medical and other treatment for the rest of his life.”Salehi is not a plaintiff in the suit. Nor is The Washington Post. Rezaian is on leave from The Post for a year as a Nieman fellow at Harvard University.“Iran’s unconscionable actions have inflicted deep and lasting wounds on The Washington Post’s Jason Rezaian and his family,” said Executive Editor Martin Baron, who during the reporter’s imprisonment often criticized what he called Iran’s “system of injustice.”“This legal filing is a stark telling of Iran’s brutal and heartless treatment of an innocent journalist and his wife, and the impact on those who love him. While this legal action is being taken solely by Jason and his family, The Post continues to support the Rezaians through their long and painful recovery.’’The Rezaian lawsuit is the latest attempt by Americans to have the U.S. justice system provide compensation for harms inflicted by the Iranian government — in particular, by the powerful and hard-line Revolutionary Guard Corps, which fiercely opposed the nuclear deal and has tried to thwart many initiatives of President Hassan Rouhani, a relative pragmatist. The corps is named as a co-defendant in the suit.“This was really one of the few ways they felt they could try to hold Iran publicly accountable,” said David Bowker, Rezaian’s attorney. “Ideally, it will deter this kind of behavior toward other innocent people.”Rezaian and his family declined to discuss the case, referring questions to their lawyer. The Iranian mission to the United Nations did not reply to an email requesting comment.In a number of suits brought against it over the years, Iran has not responded, resulting in default judgments.Congress and U.S. courts have provided a legal framework for Americans to sue Iran and be compensated. The State Department has labeled Iran the top state sponsor of terrorism in the world. Sudan and Syria are also on the list.In April, the Supreme Court upheld a law allowing American victims of terrorism and their families to collect almost $2 billion in seized Iranian assets. The case involved relatives of people killed or injured in the 1983 bombing of the U.S. Marine Corps barracks in Beirut. Iran labeled the decision “confiscation” and “theft.”The closest precedent to Rezaian’s case involves Nik Moradi, an Iranian American who was seized during a family visit in 2007 and accused of spying for the United States. More than six months before his release on bail, he said, he was subjected to physical and mental torture during interrogations. In 2013, Moradi and his wife sued Iran in U.S. federal court under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act. The couple was awarded $20 million in a default judgment after Iran failed to respond.One possible venue for securing payment on a judgment is the Victims of State Sponsored Terrorism Fund, created last year by Congress to compensate the Americans held hostage in Iran during the takeover of the U.S. Embassy in Tehran after the 1979 revolution. It also set aside money for victims with court judgments against state sponsors of terrorism, funded by money from a civil penalty paid by BNP Paribas bank for violating sanctions against Iran, Cuba and Sudan.The lawsuit provides dark glimpses of Rezaian’s 50 days in solitary confinement in a small, dank, cockroach-infested cell. Anxiety and depression made him hallucinate, as he perceived the walls moving and talking. The cell was constantly lighted, and a noisy fan hindered his sleep. Rezaian slept on the floor, and prison officials eventually gave him tranquilizers to induce sleep. His food sometimes had concrete, rocks, dirt and other inedible objects mixed in.“During his time in solitary confinement, Jason believed he was losing his mind,” the suit says.In the initial months of his imprisonment, Rezaian was taken blindfolded several times a day to an underground room for interrogations that lasted hours. He was forced to write down his answers, which prison officials translated into Farsi before trying to coerce him to sign without explaining the translations.In an effort to get Rezaian to confess to espionage, the suit says, one interrogator threatened him with beheading. Another held out the carrot of a video confession as his only chance for freedom.“They threatened Jason with physical mutilation, such as cutting off his limbs, and repeatedly told Jason that he would never see Yeganeh alive again,” the suit says.Though Salehi is not a plaintiff, her agony is clear in the suit’s dry legalese.During her detention, Salehi was blindfolded as interrogators hit t</td>\n",

       "      <td>Warning: This story includes graphic images.When the gates to India’s Godavari Pushkar Ghat in Rajahmundry in Andhra Pradesh swung open early Tuesday morning, some 5,000 pilgrims rushed in.They were there for a 12-day Hindu religious bathing ceremony called Godavari Maha Pushkaram, convinced a dip in the water would wash away their sins.In the surge of humanity, some pilgrims lost their shoes and, when they fought the crowd to retrieve them, they triggered a deadly stampede — the kind that has devastated the country throughout the years. Witness said some tried to scale a wall near the river. Others were pushed forward. Dozens were trampled as friends and relatives cried out.“It was a frightening situation, with women and children crying for help,” pilgrim V. Satyanarayana told the Associated Press. “The policemen on duty were helpless and it took more than an hour to bring the situation under control.”Police tried to break through, pulling people out by an arm or an ankle. When the crowd died down, at least 27 people were left dead and more than 60 injured.A sea of mismatched sandals were left behind.The Pushkaram festivals occur annually, rotating each year among India’s 12 sacred rivers. The Godavari Maha Pushkaram, however, occurs only once every 144 years.“There is a false belief that taking a holy dip in the river on the first day of the festival will be more auspicious,” Swamy Swaroopanand, a Hindu holy man, told the Associated Press. “It’s the same as taking dip on any other day.”Officials told the Hindustan Times the small city of Rajahmundry was not equipped to handle it. Witnesses told the Times of India there were no clear exit or entry points to the river, which confused the crowd, and amid the chaos, police were not able to clear roads for ambulances waiting nearby.Such stampedes, particularly at places of pilgrimage, have plagued India for years, so much so that despite the vast number of lives they claim, they receive little notice outside the country.As the thousands of faithful stream in through narrow passages to the water, they often find themselves on slippery and uneven slopes and crumbling stairways, called “ghats,” which can become treacherous when panic ensues. Since many are in rural areas, anything amounting to crowd control is sparse or nonexistent. Those who have witnessed these tragedies come away horrified.Still, the incidents are no deterrent to those whose religious fervor and traditions beckon.More than 1,000 people have been killed in stampedes during the past decade, the worst of which came in 2005 when nearly 350 people were killed and more than 200 were injured at a religious festival at Mandher Devi temple in western Maharashtra, according to India Today.Masses were also killed in stampedes near temples in 2006 and 2008. In 2011, more than 100 were killed at a religious festival in Kerala.In 2013, more than 110 were killed in Madhya Pradesh when it was thought that a bridge crowded with people was about to collapse.“The higher tolerance for crowded spaces in India allows for people to get closer, because they don’t feel uncomfortable until it is very packed,” Teresa Moore with the International Centre for Crowd Management and Security Studies in the U.K. told the Wall Street Journal in 2013.Such crowds often grow too large, too fast, Moore said.“People panic and react,” she said. “Couple that with a rumor, which can come out of that feeling of panic, that’s when you can get a surge or a problem.”Part of the problem, researchers say, is that India’s largest religious festivals are often held in rural areas that don’t have the infrastructure to handle them.A 2013 study in the International Journal of Disaster Risk Reduction found that religious gatherings and pilgrimages account for 79 percent of stampedes.“The triggers of human stampedes have been identified from case studies and it is concluded that a simple accident, an intentional act or even a rumor can trigger a crowd disturbance,” it said. “Safety and comfort of religious mass gatherings is primarily influenced by the vulnerability of the location and their accompanying characteristics,” it continued. “Religious festivals, especially when located at remote rural areas and on hilly terrains, and on the foothills or at riverbanks lacking proper pathways always pose a geographical risk to the pilgrims. Steep slopes, uneven topography of the venue, dead ends, slippery and muddy floors, narrow passages, convergence of pedestrian flow to a single point are among the common risks prevailing in religious gathering sites, compromising safety and triggering stampedes.“Devotees visiting the locations even during the late night to early morning lead to huge and prolonged mass gatherings at vulnerable locations.”Before Tuesday morning’s stampede, chief minister Chandrababu Naidu and his family bathed in the Godavari River as the crowd started to swell. When Naidu left, the barricades were removed and the people poured in.“After the CM left, all of a sudden they opened the gates without first trying to control the crowd,” witness V. Ramesh told the Times of India. “This set off the stampede.”Some were shoved down the steps into the river and drowned.After the incident, Naidu took to Twitter to reassure pilgrims.“It is regrettable that lives are lost in stampede at Rajahmundry Ghat. Request people not to panic. Situation brought under control,” he wrote. “I request to people to head to other Pushkar ghats to avoid overcrowding at single ghat. I’m monitoring situation from control room.”Naidu has since put out a statement asking pilgrims not to rush into a single ghat.“Please maintain restraint, follow queue lines and instructions, and head to other Pushkar Ghats when you see excess crowd at one place,” he said. “Pilgrims safety is of top priority to us. We will provide complete assistance.”An estimated 40 million people are expected to participate in the 12-day religious festival at different points along the river, according to organizers.</td>\n",

       "      <td>A few years ago, northern Nigeria was a global epicenter of polio transmission, but a program that mobilized local Muslim clerics, who were once opposed to immunization and are now advocates for vaccination, has helped radically reduce infections, according to researchers.Gambo G. Aliyu, a research fellow in vaccine evaluation at the University of Manitoba in Canada, and his colleagues launched a pilot program in 2008 in Gezawa, an area near Kano, northern Nigeria’s largest city, where there was strong opposition to polio vaccination.Working with a government health agency, they used mobile roadside film shows to educate the community about the risks of polio and show testimonies from caretakers of polio sufferers and those affected by the disease. And they directly involved local Muslim leaders called imams, who had been distrustful of the vaccination programs, to mobilize the communities.“This is the society I belong to, and I know how seriously they take the message from the Friday prayers. I believe they will take the advice of the imam most seriously,” said Aliyu, lead author of the report published Tuesday in PLOS Medicine.In six months of the pilot program, the number of immunized children younger than 5 went from 2,755 to 11,364.Aliyu said that when he was growing up in Jigawa state in northern Nigeria, he saw many children affected by polio, a crippling and potentially fatal disease. He believed, like many, that it was caused by a bad spirit.“The local community believed the disease was spread by a demon spirit and if you were unlucky you might come across it and it would strike you, and your limb would be paralyzed,” he said in a telephone interview. “We didn’t know this is something infectious, something you can get from the environment.”At medical school in Zaria, another northern state, he learned about polio and realized the bad curse was in fact a disease that could be protected against.In 1988, polio was endemic in 125 countries, according to UNICEF. Since then, through aggressive vaccination programs, the virus has been almost eradicated in most countries, with the notable exceptions of Pakistan, Afghanistan and Nigeria.Until two or three years ago, Nigeria, and particularly Kano in the predominantly Muslim north of Africa’s most populous country, was the epicenter of global polio infections, according to UNICEF.Opposition to the vaccine by some local scientists and rumors that the vaccines caused sterility and were a covert attempt to reduce the Muslim population in the north added to resistance. Incidents such as when a small number of vaccine-induced infections in 2006 led to outbreaks bolstered these fears.A milestone for the program was when it gained the support of the Sultan of Sokoto, a spiritual leader in Nigeria, who helped launch the Northern Traditional Leaders Committee for Primary Health Care and Polio Eradication in 2009.In 2010, a team of experts consisting mainly of Nigerian Muslim scientists was formed to assist the committee, which included four of the authors of the new report. The team mapped the high-risk areas in the north within the 12 polio-prevalent states and set up the Northern Religious Leaders Contact Group, assisted by the sharia boards and ministries for religious affairs.The program has since provided training for about 18,000 Muslim imams, through 10 weekly sessions, educating them on the facts about polio, providing a platform for discussion, answering questions and concerns, and arming them with advice they can share with their communities.Imams were given template sermons about polio and the importance of vaccination that they could use during Friday prayers and daily discussions.“The missing link with campaigns in the past was that we didn’t figure out how to connect with the society,” Aliyu said. “From now on, we will maximize the use of traditional and religious leaders as part of the campaign.”When the committee of imams was launched in 2009, there were 384 new wild poliovirus cases reported in Nigeria, most in the northern states. By 2010, the number of reported cases had plummeted to 21.In 2011, however, there were 62 cases in the northern states, and 118 in 2012. Last year the number of cases dropped to 49.According to UNICEF, there have been five cases so far in 2014, three of which were in Kano state.“We’re seeing exciting news in Nigeria,” said Sarah Crowe, chief of crisis communications at UNICEF. “It’s the next big hope.”Read: Virus sleuths, public health officials track mysterious polio-like virus</td>\n",

       "      <td>Frequent use of high-potency weed may be linked to an increased risk of having a psychotic episode. But milder strains of marijuana, even when used heavily, don't appear to carry any increased risk of psychosis.Those are the headline findings of an important new study published in the journal Lancet Psychiatry yesterday. Researchers obtained data from 410 South London patients sent to the hospital for a first-episode psychotic incident (meaning they hadn't been previously diagnosed with disorder), and compared it to data from 370 control individuals living in the same area.Compared with someone who had never smoked, a weekly user of high-potency weed (defined here as having greater than 15 percent THC content) was about three times as likely to be diagnosed with a psychotic disorder. For daily users, the risk increased to five times.On the other hand, the researchers found no link between frequent use of low-potency weed (&lt; 5 percent THC content) and psychotic disorder.In studies like this one, it's important to remember that correlation doesn't indicate causation. \"The authors clearly point out that they cannot be sure the association seen in their study is causal,\" writes Suzi Gage, a University of Bristol researcher who studies the link between marijuana use and psychosis, in The Guardian newspaper. \"The people who choose to smoke cannabis might be different in a variety of other ways, which could be the cause of the increase in psychosis risk. Although you can control for these in analyses, you can never be sure you’ve adequately adjusted for them.\"Still, the different findings for smokers of low- and high-potency weed are significant, and worth digging into -- especially considering that most of the marijuana consumed in the U.S. today is of the high-octane variety.As the chart shows, the average strength of weed seized by federal authorities has steadily risen over time. Retail outlets in Denver and elsewhere advertise strains that contain 25 percent THC or more. As legalization opponents are forever fond of saying, this isn't your daddy's weed.Just as you'd expect a daily pint of vodka to take a greater toll on your health than a daily pint of beer, it seems reasonable to posit that frequent use of high-octane weed will have different health consequences than a daily toke of the milder stuff. But due at least partially to the economic incentives imposed by cannabis prohibition, low-potency weed is typically harder to come by these days.Today's illicit weed has a lot in common with prohibition-era moonshine. To maximize profits while avoiding detection, many of today's pot growers maintain a singular focus on boosting THC content to the exclusion of all other considerations. The weed they produce is generally good for getting you very high, but little else. The absence of a regulatory framework -- particularly labeling requirements that let you know what you're smoking -- means that buying weed on the black market today is akin to buying a bottle of booze without knowing whether it contains beer or vodka.And chemically speaking, marijuana is a more complicated substance than alcohol. The high of a given strain of bud is determined not just by THC, but by the interaction of dozens of chemical compounds in the plant that researchers are only just now beginning to understand. One of those compounds, cannabidiol or CBD, is actually known to have anti-psychotic effects, and it eases the paranoia that sometimes comes with getting really, really high. CBD and THC are present in roughly equal quantities in low-potency weed, but in the high-octane stuff CBD is essentially non-existent. This is likely one reason why the Lancet study found higher odds of psychosis among users who liked their weed strong.As prohibition eases and legal markets open up, growers now have the breathing room to select for traits beyond high THC content. Demand from new users looking to experience a social high, rather than four hours of couch lock, will likely drive this. The end result may be a resurgence of milder strains of weed that are more akin to fine wines than to bathtub gin. From a mental health standpoint, they'll be safer too.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Alan Gross, the U.S. contractor released Wednesday after five years of captivity in Cuba, was greeted with a, well, surprising art choice while preparing to make a statement on U.S. soil this afternoon.Visible in the background of a widely circulated photograph of Gross, his lawyer Scott Gilbert and spokesperson Jill Zuckman: An image of Che Guevara, the divisive revolutionary figure.“Why is there a Che Guevara pic in background?” National Review Online’s Andrew Johnson tweeted.Others responded with sympathy: “Poor guy gets to his lawyer’s office and has to look at yet another Che glamour shot,” Andrew Grossman tweeted.Zuckman told The Post via e-mail that the photograph was taken at the Gilbert LLP law firm.The print, from a distance, appears to be the same image that’s often emblazoned on T-shirts, posters and other memorabilia. That iconic image is based on a photograph by Alberto “Korda” Diaz Gutierrez; we have more on the history of the image here.Guevara was a leader in the Castro brothers’ revolution to overthrow the Batista dictatorship in Cuba and replace it with a communist government. As the Huffington Post noted: “Cuban-Americans generally revile him for his role in establishing the island’s Communist dictatorship.”In his remarks, Gross made it clear that he did not blame the Cuban people for his imprisonment:“In no way are they responsible for the ordeal to which my family and I have been subjected,” Gross said. “To me, Cubanos — or at least, most of them — are incredibly kind, generous and talented. It pains me to see them treated so unjustly as a consequence of two governments’ mutually belligerent policies.”</td>\n",

       "      <td>A new form of a dangerous “superbug” may be spreading to humans through contaminated poultry that people handle or eat, according to a study published Wednesday.Researchers focused on a newly identified strain of the bacterium known as MRSA, or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, that they found in people in Denmark. Although most individuals who become infected with MRSA don’t get it from food, the study suggests that this poultry-associated strain may be more easily transmitted from food to people.The findings underscore the importance of reducing the use of antibiotics in food-producing animals to boost their growth, the researchers say. The issue is expected to be discussed prominently at an unusual meeting at the United Nations on Wednesday. The high-level summit is focused on the rising threat posed by superbugs, microbes that can’t be stopped with drugs. It is only the fourth time that the world’s decision-makers have addressed a health concern at the U.N. General Assembly.MRSA, which is resistant to several antibiotics, is commonly found in locker rooms, hospitals, military barracks and other settings where large numbers of people congregate. The bacteria can cause serious infections, including pneumonia and bloodstream infections that can cause life-threatening sepsis.Until now, researchers have known that livestock can carry the bacteria, putting farmers, farmworkers, veterinarians and others who work directly with animals at greater risk. MRSA bacteria have also been shown to be present in foods, including pork, beef and dairy, although outbreaks from food contamination have been rare.“This shows that everyday consumers — the general public — are also potentially at risk,” said Lance Price, a member of the research team and director of the Antibiotic Resistance Action Center at George Washington University.As part of the study, published in the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases, U.S. and Danish researchers utilized a national, multiyear MRSA database at the Statens Serum Institut in Copenhagen. They identified 10 people in urban areas who had carried or been infected with this new strain. None had worked on farms or had direct exposure to food animals. Regardless, no Danish livestock showed evidence of this particular type of bacteria.Using genetic analysis to compare the strain found in the 10 study subjects and those found in people, livestock and food products from other European countries, the researchers were able to trace the bacteria to poultry imported from those other countries, including France, Germany, Italy and the Netherlands.Samples of the strain in the Danes were virtually identical, a finding that suggests all of the individuals were exposed from a common source, most likely contaminated chicken or turkey.“Our findings implicate poultry meat as a source for these infections,” said Robert Skov, a researcher at the Copenhagen institute.In the United States and other countries, officials monitor the food supply for intestinal bacteria such as E. coli, salmonella and campylobacter. But staph bacteria, including MRSA, are not included.Although food is still a relatively minor source of MRSA transmission, Price said the research shows the superbug is changing and evolving in real time.“The more we treat huge gobs of animals with antibiotics and huge gobs of humans with antibiotics,” he said, the greater the likelihood that relatively rare types of transmission will become more common.Read more:Newest superbug found in a Connecticut toddlerMajor global partnership launched to speed antibiotic developmentBehind the scenes of a superbug discovery that made headlines around the worldA deadly, drug-resistant yeast infection is spreading around the world</td>\n",

       "      <td>Finally, some happy news for wild tigers, animals that are endangered because people traffic in their body parts and raze their habitats: The big cats’ population is for the first time bouncing back after a century-long decline.The World Wildlife Fund says surveys indicate that 3,890 tigers now live in 13 countries across Asia, up from an estimated 3,200 in 2010, when the last wide-scale counts were carried out. Increases were particularly notable in Russia, Nepal, Bhutan and India, which is home to the world’s largest wild tiger population.WWF attributed the rise to better surveys, which are carried out by tiger-range countries and the International Union for Conservation of Nature, as well as enhanced protection efforts in the six years since those nations pledged to double the population by 2022.“We’ve watched tigers decline for decades and have dreamed of bending that curve in the other direction,” said Carter Roberts, president and CEO of World Wildlife Fund (WWF). “This is a big deal.”There are some caveats, of course. The current tiger population is bigger than it was six years ago, but it’s miniscule compared to the 100,000 believed to have lived in Asia in 1900, and it’s still smaller than the estimated 5,000 to 10,000 captive tigers that call the United States home.Surveys remain poor in some countries, such as Malaysia. Last week, Cambodia announced that tigers were now extinct within its borders. And tigers are still prized, and killed, for the supposed medicinal value of their body parts.“Every part of the tiger — from whisker to tail — is traded in illegal wildlife markets, feeding a multibillion-dollar criminal network,” WWF said in a statement.But at the rate of growth over the past six years, the goal of doubling the population by 2022 — the next Chinese year of the tiger — appears within reach.Ginette Hemley, senior vice president of wildlife conservation at WWF, told Scientific American that the goal “is going to be a challenge” and may take longer than planned. “I think it’s doable,” she said, “but it’s not going to happen without big mobilizations of additional resources and commitments.”Read more:One man’s wild idea for saving rhinos: Airlifting them to AustraliaRare Sumatran rhino, once believed to be extinct, dies just weeks after being discoveredTiger farms stoke Chinese demand for tiger wine and rugs, putting wild cats in peril</td>\n",

       "      <td>Most of us would probably prefer that nobody found out if we got hacked. Not so for Julie Brill, a commissioner at the Federal Trade Commission who really wants you to know about the time she fell for an email phishing scam.\"These are not the prince-from-Nigeria types of attacks of the past that we're used to,\" Brill said in a recent interview. \"These are deeply sophisticated.\"Phishing scams can affect anyone — even, as it turns out, high-ranking federal officials whose whole jobs revolve around regulating corporate data security practices. The irony isn't lost on Brill, who is trying to turn her personal story into an object lesson for consumers like you and me.As Brill tells it, the saga began earlier this year. A business contact of hers — Gene Kimmelman, president of the consumer group Public Knowledge — sent her an email with an innocuous-looking Google Drive attachment. But after clicking on the link and entering in some of her personal information on the resulting page, she soon realized the truth: This was not a Google site at all.Instead, online criminals had muscled their way into Kimmelman's email account and begun sending fake emails in his name to everyone in the account's address book. (I, too, got a fraudulent email from Kimmelman's attackers.)\"I was busy, I saw an email from this person, I opened it, tried to interface with it,\" said Brill. \"And I pretty soon realized this was a false email from [someone] who was trying to get my data.\"Luckily, even though Brill had given out some of that data, she had made sure that the criminals wouldn't be able to hijack her own accounts. She'd taken advantage of two-factor authentication, a security measure that prevents someone from logging into a website unless they can also reproduce a special code sent to a separate device such as your mobile phone. Two-factor or two-step verification has been adopted by Google, Amazon and other major websites to combat the rise of digital fraud.The loss of information took place on Brill's personal computer, so nothing in the FTC's systems was affected, she said. But she did consult with the agency's IT managers.\"Once they found out I had two-factor authentication and I had changed some passwords, they were comforted that I had done all that I could do,\" said Brill. \"If it had been an attack on our systems, they would have jumped into high gear right away.\"So how did the hackers break into Kimmelman's address book in the first place? That mystery may never be solved.\"It was either a random hack, or someone … knew those on my contact list would expect me to have secret documents to share,\" Kimmelman joked in an email. \"If not a random hack, my reputation may be ruined!\"Kimmelman has since switched email accounts.Brill is leaving the FTC at the end of the month to enter the private sector — a decision that was unrelated to this incident. But her imminent departure makes this an opportune time to highlight the risks of not having two-factor authentication enabled for your sensitive online accounts.\"I say to groups, 'How many of you have two-factor authentication?' and I don't see enough hands,\" said Brill. \"So I say to folks, 'If you get nothing else out of this talk, please go home and turn on two-factor authentication.' \"</td>\n",

       "      <td>LONDON — The Church of England voted Monday to allow women to serve as bishops, a historic decision that takes the church a step closer toward achieving gender equality.The move effectively shatters the glass ceiling that prevented women here from being promoted to top church jobs and was made possible after reformers and traditionalists reached a compromise that would satisfy parishes opposed to female bishops.At their annual gathering at the University of York, 351 members of the General Synod, the church’s ruling body, voted in favor of the proposal while 72 voted against it and 10 abstained.That it has taken this long for the church, the mother church of the Anglican Communion, to make the move may seem baffling to Anglicans in countries such as the United States, Canada and New Zealand, where women already serve as bishops.It has been baffling for many here, too, with churchgoers and even the prime minister accusing the Church of England of being out of step with the times.But the issue of women as bishops remains highly divisive in the global Anglican community. The majority of the world’s 80 million Anglicans reside in Africa, where many vehemently oppose the idea.In concessions to opponents with theological objections, the package of measures passed Monday allows a parish unsatisfied with a female bishop to ask for a male alternative and take its complaints to an independent body.“You don’t chuck out family or even make it difficult for them to be at home,” Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby said in reference to the traditionalists during a lively, five-hour debate that preceded the vote.When Welby was confirmed to his post last year, he inherited a church still reeling from a crisis sparked in 2012 after a similar proposal to ordain women as bishops was rejected by six votes. At the time, an influential group of lawmakers called for the government to intervene and revoke the church’s exemption from equality legislation.The church approved the ordination of female priests 22 years ago, but they were barred from becoming bishops because of opposition from male clergy. Today, women make up about one-third of all church clergy but are less likely than their male counterparts to receive a stipend for their work.During the gathering Monday, a message was read out from Desmond Tutu, the retired archbishop of South Africa, where women already serve as bishops. “Wow, you are in for a great surprise and a treat,” he wrote. “Yippee!”</td>\n",

       "      <td>The great shrinking of the middle class that has captured the attention of the nation is not only playing out in troubled regions like the Rust Belt, Appalachia and the Deep South, but in just about every metropolitan area in America, according to a major new analysis by the Pew Research Center.Pew reported in December that a clear majority of American adults no longer live in the middle class, a demographic reality shaped by decades of widening inequality, declining industry and the erosion of financial stability and family-wage jobs. But while much of the attention has focused on communities hardest hit by economic declines, the new Pew data, based on metro-level income data since 2000, show that middle-class stagnation is a far broader phenomenon.The share of adults living in middle-income households has also dwindled in Washington, New York, San Francisco, Atlanta and Denver. It's fallen in smaller Midwestern metros where the middle class has long made up an overwhelming majority of the population. It's withering in coastal tech hubs, in military towns, in college communities, in Sun Belt cities.The decline of the American middle class is \"a pervasive local phenomenon,\" according to Pew, which analyzed census and American Community Survey data in 229 metros across the country, encompassing about three-quarters of the U.S. population. In 203 of those metros, the share of adults in middle-income households fell from 2000 to 2014.Pew defines middle-income households here as those making between two-thirds and twice the national median household income. For a three-person household in 2014, that means an income between about $42,000 and $125,000. The fact that median incomes have declined over this same time frame also means that the bar to get into the middle class is actually lower now than it was in 2000. Pew's metro-level data are also adjusted for household size and local cost of living.The shrinking middle class is in part a reflection of rising income inequality in America, and of the same underlying and uneven economic forces that have fueled the rise of Donald Trump. And as the middle class has been shrinking, median incomes have fallen, too. In 190 of these 229 metros, the median income dropped over this same time.As the middle class has shrunk, Pew points out, the lower and upper classes in America have grown in size and significance. In some metros, the middle class is dwindling primarily because families are falling out of it and into the lower class. The share of households in this bottom tier has skyrocketed since 2000, for instance, in Goldbsoro, North Carolina, a railroad junction with an Air Force base.But in other places, the shrinking middle class is actually a sign of economic gains, as more people who were once middle class have joined the ranks at the top. This has been the case in booming energy hubs like Midland, Texas.In the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area, the share of adults living in lower-income households has actually held steady over this time. The households disappearing from the middle-class, rather, are reflected in the growing numbers at the top (this does not mean, though, that the same middle-class families are necessarily becoming wealthier; changes in the population makeup of the region may also reflect who moves away from the area and who migrates in).In total, 172 of these 229 metros saw a growing share of households in the upper-income tier. About as many — 160 — saw a growing share at the bottom. And 108 experienced both: The middle class shrank as the ranks of both the poor and the rich grew.The places with greatest net economic losses — where the shrinking middle-class has meant a sizable influx of households among the poor — are metro areas that have historically relied heavily on manufacturing, like Detroit, Fort Wayne, Ind., and Springfield, Ohio.In only about a quarter of all of these metros does the middle class make up less than a majority of the adult population today. But the largest metros in the country fall into this group, including New York, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Boston and Washington. In each of these metros, the middle class is relatively small because the upper-class share of the population is larger than average.These same metros also tend to have wider income inequality, reflecting the broad spectrum of jobs in industries from the low-paying service sector to finance and biotech. As a result, not surprisingly, Pew's data shows that metros with greater income inequality tend to have smaller middle classes. When the income distribution is narrower, on the other hand, more people are likely to be clustered in that middle tier between $42,000 and $125,000.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Growing up, Emilie Olsen had an infectious smile, a love for horses and a perfect attendance record. She was a straight-A student and an excellent volleyball player. Emilie “had an extremely sweet spirit about her,” a family friend recalled.On Dec. 11, 2014, the 13-year-old shot and killed herself at home.It was a tragedy that sent a jolt through Fairfield, Ohio, where Emilie had lived since her parents, Marc and Cindy Olsen, adopted her from China when she was 9 months old. Classmates and neighbors mourned a young life cut short.But in the days following Emilie’s death, her parents spoke out against the seeming suddenness of it all. Emilie’s death was precipitated by cruel, relentless bullying, the Olsens said. Worse: It could have been prevented, they claimed, if officials at Fairfield Intermediate and Middle School had been more responsive. Emilie did not have to die, they said.These were the allegations made in an 82-page federal lawsuit the Olsens filed against Fairfield City School District, various administrators and Emilie’s alleged bullies last December. Since then, their fight to hold the school district accountable for their daughter’s death has been met with support from parents and denials from school officials.Former Fairfield City Schools superintendent Paul Otten, who is among the defendants named in the complaint, left his position last month to become the superintendent of the nearby Beavercreek City School District.Just last week, Fairfield Middle School Principal Lincoln Butts, also a defendant, resigned for “personal reasons.”Neither administrator gave specific explanations for leaving. In response to the lawsuit’s December filing, the school district said in a statement, according to WCPO: “The District will be defending the litigation and will be providing appropriate responses in the course of the litigation. The District has no further comment at this time regarding this pending matter.”Meanwhile, the lawsuit alleges that Emilie suffered discrimination because of her race and perceived sexual orientation and that school officials were negligent in their handling of her bullying. The complaint details a downward spiral brought on by unabating abuse.Escalating incidentsIt started in the fifth grade, according to the complaint, when Emilie took to wearing camouflage-patterned clothing and cowboy boots. Her style allegedly prompted jeers from classmates, who called her “fake country” — because “Chinese people don’t wear camo.”Things got worse when Emilie entered the sixth grade, the complaint said. She allegedly became the target of mean-spirited social media messages, as well as a fake Instagram account called “Emilie Olsen is Gay.” One classmate allegedly followed Emilie into the bathroom, handed her a razor and instructed her to “end her life.”Other Instagram accounts surfaced, making sexually explicit comments and derogatory remarks about Emilie’s perceived sexual orientation.In the gym one day, Emilie and another female student got into a scuffle over the fake accounts, and the student allegedly pushed Emilie and slapped her in the face. A teacher allegedly witnessed and broke up the fight but took no action other than to direct the students “back to class.”“I have a bad feeling that if nothing is done then this has the possibility to escalate into something worse,” Marc Olsen wrote in an email to the school’s assistant principals after learning of the fight from the father of a student who saw it happen. He then received a phone call from one of the principals, who allegedly said they were “going to take care of the situation.”According to the lawsuit, no students were ultimately disciplined for the fight or the Instagram accounts. Otten, the former superintendent, told WCPO last May that he didn’t know about the online bullying.“You’re assuming that when we get something (from parents) we start researching kids’ Instagram accounts and printing stuff off,” he said. “I wasn’t aware of it.”Otten added that he has four kids enrolled in the school district. “I can assure you,” he told WCPO, “… there is nothing for me to gain by hiding anything.”The bullying only intensified in seventh grade, the complaint said, when Emilie was placed in the same learning group as several girls who had allegedly harassed her the year before. By then, Emilie had started to inflict self-harm and express suicidal and depressive thoughts.When the Olsens brought these circumstances to the principals’ attention, they were allegedly told that Emilie “needed to buckle down” and cope even though she told an administrator she was “frightened to return to school.”While the cyber-bullying continued, physical messages allegedly started to appear on the stalls and walls of the school’s bathrooms. These scrawled scripts singled Emilie out by name — “Go kill yourself Emilie” — and made reference to Emilie’s race and perceived sexual orientation. According to the complaint, while the messages were in “easily observable” locations and “could not have been missed by anyone using the restrooms, including the school administrators” and teachers, the staff failed to remove them in a timely manner.In October 2014, a group of Emilie’s friends defended her against her bullies in the cafeteria, initiating a verbal dispute as her friends yelled at the bullies to stop “messing” with Emilie. (The students’ incident reports were obtained by WCPO.)At a previously scheduled meeting with the assistant principals the next day, Olsen was not told about the fight involving his daughter, the complaint alleges. In the following days, Emilie started vomiting and feeling unwell. When Olsen informed the school that she would be absent because she was feeling sick, he was allegedly still not told about the fight.Through all of this, Emilie was becoming increasingly withdrawn, barely recognizable from her old self, the complaint says. She seemed to take little interest in her schoolwork, and her grades dropped dramatically. On a personality quiz that Emilie was required to take for class, she described her “bad day symptoms” as “crying, depressing, yelling and screaming, passive resistance, and going into a trance,” the complaint says.Her Internet search history showed attempts to get help, followed by growing despair, her parents say in their lawsuit.Emilie asked strangers online whether they had ever been bullied and viewed articles about celebrities who were bullied in school. She visited a website with the line “I’m just a kid and my life is a nightmare,” and a picture of a young woman’s slashed forearm, with the caption “I’m not strong anymore.”At a school where Asian Americans were allegedly labeled “too smart” and mocked for their “slanted eyes,” Emilie seemed to feel alienated, the complaint says.She sought permission to dye her hair to “look more like a white person.” Her parents allege that she asked her father, “Why can’t I be white like you and mom?”Marc Olsen later told police that Emilie had been suffering from depression and had a history of cutting herself, the Butler County Journal-News reported.“I[‘m] causing all this trouble on earth,” Emilie wrote to a friend on Facebook on Dec. 1, 2014, the complaint says. “It hurts when you have to explain yourself to people you don’t know or like. You feel them judging you, staring at you, talking about you, and I’ve made up my mind, I wanna die.”She went on: “Even if there [sic] adults they hate me. I can’t please anyone with anything I do. Not even my teachers.”Less than two weeks later, Emilie killed herself with her father’s gun.A school’s roleFive days after the suicide, the Olsens were in the throes of grief when they allegedly received a visit from Principal Butts and a group of police officers. According to the lawsuit, the officers coerced the Olsens to let them inside their home, then told Marc Olsen that he was “stirring the pot” and “entertaining rumors” by talking to the media about Emilie’s death.At that point, Ols</td>\n",

       "      <td>It’s late August and thousands of teenagers are moving out of home to begin their college careers. While these freshmen are undoubtedly excited about starting this new adventure, as time passes, many of them might wonder whether the benefits of their college education will be worth the cost to obtain that education. Their parents who are footing a bill that may exceed a quarter of a million dollars by the time their child earns the prized college degree may also wonder whether those funds could have been better invested elsewhere.This kind of thinking may be particularly true for students who will borrow tens of thousands of dollars to pay for their bachelor’s degree and yet may find themselves four years later working at a Starbucks or driving a car for Uber.It’s also this kind of thinking that’s reflected in surveys like the one the Pew Research Center conducted a few years ago that reported a majority of Americans said that college wasn’t “worth it” because it didn’t “provide students with good value for the money they and their families spend,” and in the recent household survey by the Federal Reserve Board, where 37 percent of respondents said that the net financial benefit of their education was negative.Those are pretty sobering figures for a country where two out of three recent high school graduates are enrolled in college, up from just one in two graduates 30 years ago. Why are they going to college if it’s not worth it?This is a difficult question to ask, especially considering that President Obama has said that “Higher education is not a luxury. Earning a post-secondary degree or credential is a prerequisite for 21st century jobs, and one that everyone should be able to afford.”So, the question becomes, would students be more satisfied with their college education if it didn’t cost so much?Before answering that question, it’s worth looking in depth at how much it costs to attend college. That’s a hard question to answer because there are wide differences between the sticker price of a year in college — it averages about $40,000 a year at a four-year, private institution and $17,000 at a four-year public institution — and what a student actually pays out of pocket after taking into account financial aid, scholarships, and other tuition assistance programs. (The comparable figures covering just tuition and fees are about $29,000 at a private college and $8,000 at a public college, according to the National Center for Education Statistics.)Thus, answering the question about whether college is worth it from a financial point of view depends on knowing how much financial “help” a student receives from the college.By way of comparison, consider two private and two public four-year, degree granting universities. The first is George Washington University, where I teach economics, and the second is the University of California at Berkeley, where I earned my undergraduate degree. I’ve added Harvard University because that school is often used as a standard for many comparisons, and California State University at Los Angeles because it’s a low-cost public institution.The data come from the federal government’s College Affordability and Transparency Center, which shows the average net price a student pays per year at the particular college or university. The net price subtracts grants and scholarships, which are amounts that a student doesn’t have to pay back, from the total cost of attendance to obtain a figure that reflects a student’s actual costs. (The total cost includes room and board, books and supplies, and personal expenses.) The student will have to pay back any loans taken out to pay for the remaining expenses.According to the CATC, a typical GWU student will pay a net price of $31,443 a year after scholarships and grants. That student will borrow a total of $24,050 and make $276.77 payments each month for 10 years to repay the loan.A typical student at U.C.-Berkeley will pay $16,178 a year after scholarships and grants and have $16,028 in federal loans for a monthly payment of $184.45 over 10 years.For Harvard, a student will pay $14,445 a year after scholarships and grants and take out $11,000 in federal loans for a monthly payment of $126.59 over 10 years.Finally, a student at California State University-Los Angeles will pay $3,713 a year after scholarships and grants. That student will have the same amount of federal student loans as the Harvard student and, therefore, have the same monthly $126.59 payment.Four colleges, four net prices: $31,443, $16,178, $14,445, and $3,713. Which college provides the greatest net benefit?It’s hard to tell. But, what these figures do show is that looking at the sticker price doesn’t reflect the value of a college education.Moreover, even the net price doesn’t tell the whole story, since scholarships and grants aren’t the only things that reduce the cost of college.Students (or their parents) may also qualify for a host of education-based tax breaks, such as the American Opportunity and the Lifetime Learning Credit, and may set aside money in tax-favored education savings accounts, known as Section 529 plans and Coverdell Education Saving Accounts, that reduce the cost of saving for college. In many cases, interest paid on qualified student loans is tax deductible.Finally, the federal government offers several “income-driven” student loan repayment plans that limit the monthly payments to a certain amount of income in exchange for extending the loan repayment period and forgive any loan amount unpaid after that period. One plan recently cut the monthly payments from 15 percent to 10 percent of disposable income and reduced the repayment period to 20 years from 25 years. Most federal student loans qualify for one of these loan repayment plans.Despite these figures, some argue that these loan repayment programs represent “government bailouts” of college graduates, as Lindsey Burke wrote in “The Signal.” Others note that a college degree is no longer required to get a good job, especially since almost four of every ten college graduates are working at jobs that don’t require a college degree. Fruzsina Eordogh is one of those students who dropped out of college to work as a full-time writer for the Daily Dot (Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg, Microsoft’s Bill Gates, and Apple’s Steve Jobs are three of America’s most famous college dropouts.)But, just because the job doesn’t require a college degree doesn’t mean that a college degree isn’t a good investment. People with college degrees tend to keep their jobs during recessions and have a lower unemployment rate over time than those with just a high school degree. Most of the new post-recession jobs require a college degree. As the Pew Research Center found, the “big payoff” to a college degree isn’t so much in earnings but the ability to have and to keep a job.Finally, it’s important to look beyond financial compensation to measure the benefits of a college education. Studies show that people with more education are in better health, their children are in better health, and their marriages are more stable relative to people with less education.The point of these studies isn’t whether college provides a net financial benefit to the student, but whether college provides a net benefit overall.Here, the bottom line is positive. The Pew survey showed that the vast majority of graduates from a four-year institution say their college education helped them grow intellectually and to mature as a person. In other words, college may teach students as much about getting along with people as it does about analyzing Shakespeare’s sonnets.On that score, college provides a clear net benefit, not just for the student but for society as well.</td>\n",

       "      <td>BEIJING —She was supposed to be having an abortion last week: This 39-year-old Chinese woman would lose her hard-earned job at a state-owned company if she had a second child. The date was even marked on her calendar, but she was panicking at the prospect.Then she spotted rumors online that China was about to abandon its one-child policy after 35 years. It was, she says, “like a lifesaving straw.” For days, she sat nervously at home watching television, waiting for news.“When I heard the announcement about the new two-child policy, I cried,” she said. “My daughter came in and asked why I was crying, and I told her she was about to have a sister or a brother. She hugged me and cried with me.”Faced with looming workforce shortages and a rapidly aging population, China announced last month that all couples would be allowed to have two children.The one-child policy had extraordinarily far-reaching effects on Chinese society, and its relaxation marks a historic shift.The government says 90 million women, half of them in their 40s, will be affected by the change, once the National People’s Congress approves a new law next year.But it has left many women agonizing about choices they made and the choices ahead of them.This woman asked not to be identified by name because her story could still land her in trouble at work. A former supervisor had warned her not to become pregnant shortly after hiring her, but she had gone ahead and had a child anyway.Her current boss, she says, is more tolerant, but state-run companies have strict rules requiring them to fire employees who have a second child.Even in private companies, many women in China face workplace pressure not to get pregnant, according to women’s rights activists, creating potential tensions and tough decisions if they now decide they want a second child.“The difficulty for women in employment will increase, and gender discrimination probably will be worse,” Wang Pei’an, a spokesman for the National Health and Family Planning Commission, said at a news conference Tuesday, adding that the problem could be addressed through a “joint effort.”The stigma around larger families has been so strong that the 39-year-old woman said she had never even told her college classmates that she had a younger brother.Gradually, though, after her daughter was born, she began to envy couples who had two children. Her daughter, too, grew lonely and wanted a sibling.But the couple decided that they could not disobey the law.The woman began suspecting that she was pregnant shortly after taking a holiday trip with her husband in southern China last month.Finally, her husband bought her a pregnancy test. She didn’t even want to look at the result.“I was scared to face it, because I didn’t want to make a choice between my child and my job,” she said. When it was positive, she said, “it was horrible news, like a thunderbolt out of a clear sky.”And so began the agony of making a decision.She had grown up in a rural part of China, where boys were considered more important and girls usually quit their studies after high school. But she had worked hard, gone to college and secured a job she enjoyed at a state-owned company. She was proud, she said, to be an “economically independent woman.”Her husband suggested that she quit her job, offering to help her find another after the baby was born. But she was worried that he could also lose his job if his employer found out. Besides, she was in line for a promotion and knew it would be hard to find work after a break.An abortion seemed like her only option.“I couldn’t give it all up for an unborn baby,” she said. “I didn’t want to be a housewife for the rest of my life.”Gao Yushuang, another 39-year-old mother, has an 8-year-old girl. She had always wanted a second child, an urge so intense that she was ready to break the law. But eventually she decided that her family could not afford a fine of $15,000 to $30,000, on top of the cost of raising a second child. She decided to stick with one.When she heard on television that the policy was changing, her mother was on the phone even before the anchor had finished speaking.“She asked: ‘What are you waiting for? The policy has changed. You should respond to your country’s call.’?”But Gao was not so sure. For her, she said, it felt like the chance had passed.“If it had happened five years before, everything would have been different,” she said. “I would have been more energetic. My parents and in-laws would have been healthier, too. I definitely would have wanted a baby.”Internet searches for pregnancy-related products surged on China’s online shopping platforms after the news broke last week, state media reported.Demographer Lu Jiehua of Peking University warned that many of the women rushing to take advantage of the policy shift would be those born in the 1970s, potentially involving greater health risks for mothers and babies.For Gao, the balance had shifted. Her parents could become sick at any time, and she thought she lacked the energy to look after and educate another young child, she said.Then there was the stigma of being an older mother, and a fear that she would spoil the child.Gao said she didn’t go into all of this with her mother. To avoid an argument, she simply said she was too old to have another baby.The following day, she said, her phone was full of information about the change in government policy.“It was more stressful than ever,” she said. “Everyone was talking about having a second child. It felt like a time bomb. I felt I had betrayed my mother’s wishes. I was scared I might regret it one day.”So Gao sat down and wrote her future self a journal titled “Why I don’t want a second child.”“If one day my only child leaves me, and I am all alone, I will read the journal, and I will understand why I didn’t have a second child, and it will stop me suffering from regret,” she said.“My tears fell when I was writing. The feeling was complicated and bitter.”Xu Jing contributed to this report.Read more:The human suffering caused by China’s one-child policySee where women outnumber men in the world (and why)Today's coverage from Post correspondents around the world</td>\n",

       "      <td>A former Marine is fighting her toughest battle yet: Recovering from the devastating effects of flesh-eating bacteria.Cindy Martinez, a 34-year-old mother of two who lives outside Atlanta, doesn’t know how she contracted necrotizing fasciitis and myositis, but it has already cost her both of her feet and her right hand. They were amputated last week, according to a Facebook page set up to support Martinez and her family.Necrotizing fasciitis, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, is a serious bacterial skin infection that spreads quickly and kills the body’s soft tissue.Martinez was diagnosed with the terrifying disease after she was admitted to the emergency room on May 25 with severe pain in her left shoulder blade, according to the family.The next day, doctors were fighting to save her life.Three days after that, doctors were forced to remove dead tissue down the left side of her body.A GoFundMe campaign has raised more than $76,000 to assist the family with medical bills. Martinez’s husband, David, who met his wife in the Marines and currently works as a Gwinnet County police officer, has spent weeks by his wife’s side in the hospital, missing work.“Sure, she was a little scared,” David Martinez told People following his wife’s triple amputation, “but she was able to fight through that fear and say, ‘Enough is enough.’ ”Like many victims, Martinez was young and otherwise healthy when she became infected.Her husband called the source of the disease “a mystery.”“She didn’t have any injury, and initially at home when she was feeling the pain, I looked at where the pain was at and I didn’t notice anything, and that’s what’s troubling,” he told ABC affiliate WSB earlier this month.Ruth Berkelman, a professor of epidemiology at the Rollins School of Public Health at Emory University, told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution that it’s not unusual for patients to be unsure about how they contracted the infection. She said the entry point can be as forgettable as a minor cut or insect bite.“Usually when you talk with patients, if you ask them if they remember having a cut or something, they say ‘yes,’ but not always,” Berkelman told the AJC. “Maybe there was an insect bite or mild abrasion they didn’t pay attention to, but it does happen when people don’t remember anything.”It’s unclear exactly how many necrotizing fasciitis cases there are each year in the United States.According to the CDC, there are “about 650 to 850 cases” of necrotizing fasciitis caused by group A streptococcus each year. But, the CDC says, “this is likely an underestimation as some cases are probably not reported.”And the National Necrotizing Fasciitis Foundation notes that the CDC does not track cases caused by the other bacteria.But the foundation, a nonprofit founded by two survivors of the disease, say the group A Strep statistics combined “with the as yet unquantifiable numbers of people who contract NF from other forms of bacteria” are “frightening.”The disease works like this, according to the CDC:Bacteria spread rapidly once they enter the body. They infect flat layers of a membrane known as the fascia, connective bands of tissue that surround muscles, nerves, fat, and blood vessels. The infection also damages the tissues next to the fascia. Sometimes toxins made by these bacteria destroy the tissue they infect, causing it to die. When this happens, the infection is very serious and can result in loss of limbs or death.The speed at which necrotizing fasciitis attacks — often originating as simple soreness or swelling — takes many victims by surprise.Zach Motal’s case was no different.One day in May, Motal was strolling beside the surf in Fort Myers, Fla.The next day, he was lying on an operating table having the lower half of his right leg amputated.In between, his foot swelled up and turned purple, unleashing such excruciating pain on the 46-year-old that he showed up to the hospital in tears thinking it was broken, according to ABC News.“I figured they were going to put a cast on me and tell me to go home,” Motal told ABC. “I would never in a million years imagine I had a flesh-eating bacteria in me.”Through a small cut on his toe, Motal had contracted group A streptococcus, according to ABC. The bacterium, doctors explained to Motal, is the most common cause of necrotizing fasciitis.The flesh-eating infection is caused by multiple kinds of bacterium, including Vibrio vulnificus, which thrives in the Gulf of Mexico and other warm salty waters during the warmer months.Recent water tests in Fort Myers came back negative for Vibrio vulnificus and doctors have told Motal that he could have contracted group A streptococcus from “anywhere,” according to ABC. Motal, however, is convinced he came into contact with the bacteria during his walk along the beach.“The water had just splashed over my foot and I didn’t think anything about it,” he told NBC affiliate WBBH.Aside from being contracted via an open wound, Vibrio vulnificus can also be transmitted by eating raw shellfish, according to the Florida Department of Health.According to the Centers for Disease Control:An average of 50 culture-confirmed cases, 45 hospitalizations, and 16 deaths are reported each year from the Gulf Coast region (reporting states are Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas). Nationwide, there are as many as 95 cases (half of which are culture confirmed), 85 hospitalizations, and 35 deaths.Two years ago, CNN reported, “the Florida Department of Health reported 11 deaths and 41 infections. Texas reports 15 to 30 annual cases, while Maryland State officials say they see an average of 25 infections per year.”According to the CDC, Vibrio vulnificus infections prove fatal approximately 50 percent of the time. The infection — which can cause vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain and blistering skin lesions — usually kills victims within 24 to 48 hours as it spreads through the bloodstream and begins laying waste to precious tissue.With so little time to act, doctors are sometimes forced to diagnose patients without a blood test and by relying on experience, according to a 2010 Sun Sentinel story.“It’s really a surgical emergency,” Brian Brown, a physician assistant, told NBC affiliate WBBH. “They need to get in and do a fasciotomy and clean out the fascial plane and maybe even amputation.”Doctors had no choice but to amputate Motal’s leg. He told ABC the leg has 2,500 stitches and looks like a prop from a “horror movie.”A master carpenter and avid motorcycle rider, Motal told ABC he’ll have to find a new profession and hobby.Even so, he told ABC, it could have been worse.“The doctor said if I hadn’t have got here when I did, within four hours I would have been dead,” he said.He added: “I think something does need to be done. The public does need to be aware that there’s a flesh-eating bacteria.”MORE READING:Clinic worker might have been exposed to bioterror bacteria at Tulane research center, report saysFDA warns about medical scopes after ‘superbug’ bacteria hits UCLA hospitalThe mysterious 2 billion-year-old creature that would make Darwin smile</td>\n",

       "      <td>In the weeks leading up to her death, Brittany Maynard became the face of the nation’s right-to-die debate. Critics called her case exploitation. Advocates argued she was making her mark. Maynard said she just wanted to leave a worthy legacy. And now that she’s gone, the trail she left behind may bring the physician-assisted suicide movement — and the deep divide about it — to a younger generation.Maynard, 29, died Saturday at her home in Portland, Ore., after taking lethal drugs prescribed by her physician. It was a decision she made earlier this year after being diagnosed with terminal brain cancer and given six months to live.Arthur Caplan, of New York University’s Division of Medical Ethics, wrote that because Maynard was “young, vivacious, attractive … and a very different kind of person” from the average patient seeking physician-assisted suicide, she “changes the optics of the debate.” In Oregon, the median age of someone who uses the state’s law to die is 71. Only six people younger than 34, like Maynard, have used it.“Now we have a young woman getting people in her generation interested in the issue,” Caplan wrote in article published on Medscape. “Critics are worried about her partly because she’s speaking to that new audience, and they know that the younger generation of America has shifted attitudes about gay marriage and the use of marijuana, and maybe they are going to have that same impact in pushing physician-assisted suicide forward.“She may change politics right here.”Her story commanded national attention. Before she died, she launched her own campaign with Compassion &amp; Choices, an advocacy group for the terminally ill. She drew support from lawmakers in Connecticut and New Jersey.“I think [legislation] could get out of the Senate,” New Jersey Assemblyman John Burzichelli (D-Gloucester County) told the Philadelphia Inquirer. Burzichelli, the bill’s sponsor, thinks it will pass New Jersey’s state legislature this year.Even the women on “The View” debated her right to die. Big names like Rosie O’Donnell said to have “control over your own death, when you’ve had no control for so long over your illness, I think is the human thing to do.”But “assisted suicide” summons up deep religious and ethical concerns among some critics, including many Catholics and those associated with the Right to Life movement. While organizations have avoided criticizing Maynard, many have come out against the media and advocacy groups for what they consider exploitation of her story to gain a political edge. National Right to Life called Compassion &amp; Choices “ghoulish” in its representation of Maynard’s tragedy.“While we would never criticize Maynard,” National Right to Life said on it Web site, “we are angry that Compassion &amp; Choices would exploit her tragedy for its own malevolent purposes. Maynard’s case is what groups like Compassion &amp; Choices live for, a beautiful young woman about to be cut down in the prime of her life. It matters not that such cases — authentically terminal illnesses — are always the opening wedge after which, once the principal is established, the ‘right’ to be ‘assisted’ expands to a whole panoply of reasons none of which are about terminal illnesses. Compassion &amp; Choice’s agenda extends far beyond terminally ill 29-year-old women.”And even though Maynard’s story, which was documented in TV interviews and popular magazines, inspired a community of supporters, there were also social media efforts devoted to persuading her to choose a different course.Ira Byock, chief medical officer of the Institute for Human Caring of Providence Health and Services, spoke loudly against the practice.“When doctor-induced death becomes an accepted response to the suffering of dying people, logical extensions grease the slippery slope,” he wrote in a New York Times op-ed. He cited statistics in Holland, where the practice is permitted, that claim more than 40 people sought and received doctor-assisted death for depression and other mental disorders. “Even the psychiatrist who began this practice in the 90’s recently declared the situation had gone ‘off the rails.'”Byock added: “Moral outrage is appropriate and needed to fix the sorry state of dying in America. Legalizing assisted suicide fixes nothing. The principle that doctors must not kill patients stands.”In a poll conducted by the New England Journal of Medicine last year, 67 percent of more than 1,700 medical experts surveyed in the United States were against the physician-assisted suicide. That same year, a Pew Research survey showed public opinion was split, with 47 percent of U.S. adults supporting the practice and 49 percent opposing it. Then a Gallup poll that year suggested results varied according to how the question was presented: Some 70 percent of Americans were in favor of allowing physicians to “end the patient’s life by some painless means,” but only 51 percent were in support of allowing doctors to help a patient “commit suicide.”Compassion &amp; Choices President Barbara Coombs Lee, who drafted Oregon’s Death With Dignity Act, argued with Byock on public television.“Hospice and palliative care is the gold standard,” she told Byock last month. “It’s wonderful. But it’s not a miracle. And it cannot prevent the kind of relentless, dehumanizing, horrific decline that Brittany faces, where her disease will cause unending seizures and headaches and nausea and vomiting and pressure in her brain, and the loss of every bodily function, including thinking and moving.”Coombs Lee added: “No palliative care, terminal sedation, or promise of effective palliative care can give Maynard the thing she treasures now … the hope of gaining control over her disease before it takes her life.”Late last month, Maynard took to her blog to address critics.“I made my decisions based on my wishes, clinical research, choices, discussions with physicians, and logic,” she wrote. “I am not depressed or suicidal or on a ‘slippery slope.’ I have been in charge of this choice, gaining control of a terrifying terminal disease through the application of my own humane logic.” Throughout the past month, she said that was the reason for her campaign — to fight for other terminally-ill patients in states without protections.Oregon, Vermont and Washington are currently the only three states that have death-with-dignity laws. Two other states, Montana and New Mexico, have court rulings that protect physicians who help patients die. Bills have been introduced in seven other states.But Caplan believes this is just the beginning.“Brittany Maynard may change this debate,” he wrote. “My forecast is that we are going to see more push to put these laws in the front of state legislatures and to get them on state ballots. We are going to see more states move in this direction.

       "0   The European Space Agency just secured 436 million euros to send its first-ever rover to Mars in 2020.The news came as a relief to scientists behind the two-part ExoMars mission, who are still reeling after their spacecraft Schiaparelli crashed in an attempt to land on the Red Planet during the first part of the mission.But a proposal to survey a near-Earth asteroid — and eventually attempt to knock it off course — was not so lucky.Last month, more than 100 planetary scientists, engineers and physicists had signed an open letter in support of NASA and ESA's Asteroid Impact and Deflection Assessment mission, warning that humanity really needs to figure out whether we can deflect a killer asteroid before it crashes into Earth. But ESA Director General Jan Woerner said that the ESA part of the program didn't get enough backing or funding to ensure its future, although the space agency will continue to study asteroid defense in other ways.“These asteroid activities, looking at how we can really defend our planet in case something is happening and Bruce Willis is not ready to do it a second time .?.?. will be continued,” he joked to Reuters, referencing the 1998 movie “Armageddon,” in which Willis plays a driller who must save Earth from an asteroid capable of causing a mass extinction.The decision makes it even less likely that NASA will pursue its half of the mission, which would have sent a spacecraft slamming into the asteroid as ESA satellites observed the maneuver.The funding decisions came out of a two-day meeting of government ministers in Lucerne, Switzerland. Europe approved an extra 339 million euros for the ExoMars rover, and ESA said it could cobble together an additional 97 million euros by reshuffling funds internally, according to Nature.“After the many challenging, difficult and rewarding moments of 2016, this is a great relief and a fine result for European space exploration,” Don McCoy, ESA’s project manager for ExoMars, told Nature.The first half of the mission, which is a joint project of ESA and the Russian Federal Space Agency, arrived at Mars this October. It included the Trace Gas Orbiter, which will circle above the planet sniffing for gases that could be signs of habitability or even life, and the Schiaparelli lander. The latter spacecraft was primarily designed to test the technologies needed for landing — and it failed.An ESA investigation revealed that the lander misinterpreted sensor data during its descent, so it thought it was below ground level rather than two miles above it. Schiaparelli jettisoned its parachute, turned off its thrusters too early and went into a free fall before coming to a crashing halt on the Martian surface.[The Schiaparelli crash shows how difficult it is to land on Mars]It was a sadly familiar scenario. Roughly half of all Mars missions fail, and ESA had already lost one lander to the deadly descent to the surface. Prospects for the rover mission, which is already over budget and delayed from its original launch date in 2018, looked uncertain after the Schiaparelli crash.“Completion of ExoMars was probably the most challenging of our discussions because of the size of the additional resources that have been put on the table,” Roberto Battiston, president of the Italian Space Agency, told the BBC.But European ministers decided to commit to the project anyway. Engineers say they learned important lessons from the crash that will help the 2020 robot land safely on the Red Planet, where it will drill beneath the surface in search of microbes that might survive beyond the reach of deadly radiation.The ESA also committed to participating in the International Space Station until at least 2024.Read more:Elon Musk unveils Mars colonization plan, but don't pack your bags just yetNASA's Juno spacecraft may have a malfunctioning engineDear Science: How did the planets get their names?That study critiquing NASA’s ‘bad science’ on asteroids is pretty bad science                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",
       "1   The Toyota sedan cruising last week down a leafy suburban parkway was like any family car on the road, save for one key detail: Its power was coming not from gasoline but hydrogen, stored in tanks beneath the seats.The first mass-market car to run off hydrogen, the $57,500 Mirai, has quickly become a powerful force in the battle for tomorrow’s roads. The four-seater can drive farther and refuel faster than any electric car a driver can buy.But the world’s biggest car company, even before the Mirai’s first California sale in October, is placing a massively risky bet on hydrogen, now sold at only a dozen American fueling stations. For many, it still evokesthe Hindenburg and the hydrogen bomb.The type of hydrogen fuel cells that run the Mirai have been repeatedly tried and abandoned by rival automakers, and electric-car pioneers have panned the technology as unrealistic and doomed to fail.“If you’re going to pick an energy source mechanism, hydrogen is an incredibly dumb one to pick,” Elon Musk, founder of Tesla, Toyota’s chief rival in the electric-car market, said in January. “It doesn’t make sense, and that will become apparent in the next few years.”Think of the Mirai as a small power plant on wheels. Instead of drawing energy from a battery, like the Nissan Leaf and Chevrolet Volt, the all-electric Mirai makes its own, by gulping in air and mixing it with hydrogen in a stack of fuel cells. The reaction cleanly powers the motor and belches out no exhaust, save for a thin trickle of water.Boosters of zero-emission vehicles have praised the Mirai — whose name in Japanese means “future” — as a solution to some of electric cars’ thorniest problems. The sedan can drive 300 miles on a full tank and be refueled in about five minutes — instead of needing to be plugged in overnight — making it an easier fit for the typical commute.Toyota has a track record for this sort of disruption, having built the first mass-produced hybrid, the Prius, from an experimental laughingstock into a clean and unexciting mainstream sedan. While still a niche — hybrids make up only 3 percent of American car sales — the Prius became emblematic of a way normal drivers could help save the world without trying too hard.“Toyota is so big that it can still be a science experiment for them,” said David Whiston, an equity strategist with investment researcher Morningstar. “If it doesn’t work out, they can go back to selling Priuses and all the other gas guzzlers no one ever talks about.”Yet these are very different roads than the ones the Prius first rolled onto 18 years ago. When drivers first bought the hybrid, they already had ways to fuel it — and no easier alternative if they wanted a greener drive.Today, the Mirai faces competition not just from electric vehicles but from traditional gas guzzlers, which because of tougher federal emissions standards drive more efficiently than ever. Traditional vehicles are also far cheaper: Though Toyota is pledging three years of free hydrogen and more than $5,000 in federal and state incentives could bring down the cost, the Mirai is about twice as pricey as the average mid-size sedan.Musk, whose company makes the electric flagship Model S, has become one of fuel cells’ most vocal critics, calling them “extremely silly” “fool cells” that siphon money and attention from the efficient battery systems that run most electric cars, including his.Nissan boss Carlos Ghosn has slammed the idea that a country as vast as the United States could efficiently build a network of hydrogen stations nearly from scratch. For Toyota, it could become a globe-spanning chicken-or-egg problem: That there are few hydrogen stations could lead to fewer drivers — and fewer of the customers those stations need to survive.Toyota, the $236 billion Japanese juggernaut, is starting small, with plans to make available only 3,000 Mirais in the United States by 2017, a sum close to the number of Ford F-150 trucks sold in a day.Most of those cars will cruise solely in California, home to 10 of the country’s 12 hydrogen refueling stations. Though other hydrogen fueling centers operate in Connecticut and South Carolina and more are in development, building or outfitting a station to supply the universe’s lightest element can cost $1 million or more.That slow start and scant infrastructure could limit how much hydrogen power can accomplish. In a report last year to investors, Citi Research analysts said they expect fuel-cell cars such as the Mirai to “have little impact on the auto market” until at least 2020.Environmental advocates have also questioned just how eco-friendly the Mirai can be. Hydrogen today is mostly produced from natural gas, a fossil fuel, and must be trucked to stations via tankers, unaided by the kind of nationwide grid that fuels battery-powered cars.Energy experts say hydrogen, over time, will increasingly come from clean renewable sources such as wind and solar. The Mirai, Toyota executives argue, is only the first step of a energy evolution that one said was the carmaker’s vision for “the next 100 years.”But the company is already pushing back on early skepticism, launching a “Fueled by Bulls--t” ad campaign named for one of Musk’s critiques to explain how hydrogen can be sourced from cow manure.The carmaker has also attempted to swat back safety concerns. Hydrogen is odorless and flammable but no more dangerous than gasoline and disperses quickly in case of leaks, company officials say. (To guard against those, engineers have gone so far as to fire high-caliber rounds to test the Mirai’s bulletproof hydrogen tanks.)The automaker has also taken to touting the Mirai’s versatility beyond the road. A plug in the trunk can turn the car into a mobile generator, the company says, delivering enough juice to power the average American home’s essentials for a week.Even in the small-batch world of environmentally friendly automaking, the Mirai’s production is an oddity, pieced together without use of a robot or conveyor belt in Toyota’s sprawling Motomachi plant in Japan. A dozen specialized workers in blue hard hats assemble the car by hand, turning out about three a day.Though no other automaker has pushed to mass-produce hydrogen cars, the Mirai is far from the first car to embark on the path to alternative power. Hydrogen-powered cars, such as the Hyundai Tucson, have gained loyal if microscopic followings in California. Honda, which recently retired its small line of FCX Clarity fuel-cell cars, said it plans to sell a space-age upgrade of the car, the FCV, sometime next spring.Toyota’s hydrogen crusade has gained a spirited boost in its home country of Japan, which plans to install fuel-cell stacks in more than 5 million homes over the next 15 years. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe became the first to own a Mirai, in December, and he recently celebrated the opening of Tokyo’s first hydrogen station as “the dawn of a true hydrogen society.”But this new age will require heavy government investment at levels American policymakers and taxpayers might be less excited about. Japan is now offering subsidies of 3 million yen, or about $25,000, to buyers of fuel-cell vehicles in Tokyo, which has pledged $375 million worth of hydrogen-related development before the city’s 2020 Olympics.Like the Prius, the Mirai could be what industry insiders call a “halo car,” a flagship meant to boost Toyota’s eco-friendly image rather than drive sales. That, skeptics say, would make Toyota’s boasting of a “hydrogen era” and the evolution of the Mirai more a marketing tactic than revolutionary act.But in the end, the trickiest obstacle for advanced fuel-cell cars might prove to be a simple one: price. At its cheapest, the Mirai can be leased for $499 a month, three times the cost of a new Corolla set to sip historically cheap gas.To succeed, Toyota will need to get “some people on board and willing to spend $50,000 on a compact car,” said Whiston, the Morningstar equity strategist. “Much li   \n",
       "2   CARACAS, Venezuela — It’s become a well-worn routine here: A news flash about President Hugo Chavez’s battle with cancer is issued, invariably delivered with great fanfare but scant details.But what is increasingly troubling Venezuelans is not just the lack of candor that envelops the president’s condition, but that the news just as often comes from Cuba as it does from government ministries in Caracas. To protest what they call Cuban meddling, university students have chained themselves together in front of the Cuban embassy, and a growing chorus of opposition leaders charge that the Cuban government is calling the shots when it comes to Chavez’s health care.Amid rising tensions over the state’s secrecy, the government issued pictures of Chavez last week, the first time he had been seen publicly in 67 days. In the photos, Chavez is smiling and holding up a copy of Cuba’s state newspaper, Granma, from a hospital bed in Cuba.And just a few days before, revolutionary icon Fidel Castro — whom Chavez has called a father figure and a saint — offered more details than Venezuelan officials had by reporting that he received updates on the Venezuelan leader’s health “every day” and that Cuba’s most famous patient “is recovering.”“Ironically, Fidel Castro knows more about our president than the Venezuelans do,” quipped Federica Romer, 19, a university student who has been among those protesting outside the embassy.For some here, it is a sign that the small, poor island nation has an outsized role in Venezuelan affairs. It’s a role that seems to have grown since June 2011, when Chavez, speaking on national television from Havana, first revealed that he had undergone surgery on the island to remove a tumor.“I have to tell you that my indignation grows every day,” said Adicea Castillo, 75, an economist who helped topple Venezuela’s last dictatorship in 1958 and said she was once supportive of Fidel Castro. “It’s outrageous to see a government and a president so beholden in this way to Cuba.”Drawing closer togetherCuba’s influence on Venezuela is well known here. Over Chavez’s 14 years in power, Cuba has sent sports trainers and doctors to Venezuela’s poor barrios and provided intelligence agents to this country’s military. Venezuela has reciprocated with 100,000 barrels of oil a day at cut-rate prices, an economic lifeline that analysts say has helped keep the Castro regime afloat.Chavez’s government has also worked tirelessly for Cuba to be accepted by other Latin American countries, an effort that paid off last month when President Raul Castro assumed the presidency of a 14-month-old regional bloc called the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States.But Chavez’s cancer has drawn the two countries even closer, with the president spending more and more time in Havana as doctors grapple with a tumor that appears to have fended off four surgeries, chemotherapy and radiation treatments.Indeed, Chavez was last seen in Venezuela on Dec. 10, when he boarded an early-morning flight to Havana. He missed his Jan. 10 swearing-in for a fourth term and, until photographs of him were released Friday, no one aside from a small cabal of aides and family members knew for sure whether he was even alive.What Venezuelans do know is that the country’s top leaders have taken to flying constantly to Cuba to meet with Chavez. Those associates say Chavez has provided them with detailed instructions on running the state.But critics say that Chavez has been in no condition to govern and that Cuba’s government is helping plot Venezuela’s course.“What’s happening in Venezuela has no precedent in our history,” said Maria Corina Machado, an outspoken anti-Chavez lawmaker. “For the first time in 200 years of republican history, the decisions regarding the destiny of our country are being taken abroad.”Such accusations have angered Venezuelan officials, who call the relationship with Cuba “a brotherhood” based on mutual respect.But the government’s annoyance at the criticism has done little to curb growing resentment among some Venezuelans.‘A great uncertainty’In recent days, university students have chained themselves outside the Cuban embassy, which has drawn other protesters angry about Chavez’s long sojourn in Havana. With a phalanx of National Guard troops protecting the embassy, the students have been sleeping on cushions and blankets in the middle of the street.They say they won’t leave until they have clear answers about the president’s health.For the protesters, the photographs issued by Chavez’s aides proved nothing. They noted that the government still has not said what kind of cancer Chavez has nor revealed details about his prognosis or whether he will even return to Caracas.“We Venezuelans are living a great uncertainty, really, because we don’t know the truth,” said Gustavo Frias, 23, who spent the weekend at the embassy with other students. “We don’t know how the president is, if he’s fine, if he’s alive, if he’s dead. The truth is what we want to know.”Emilia Diaz-Struck contributed to this report.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",
       "3   Polish baroque painter Krzysztof Lubieniecki finished “Portrait of a Young Man” sometime around 1728, and the work of art eventually made its way to Poland’s National Museum in Warsaw.Then, like thousands of other European artworks, the painting fell into Nazi hands during World War II. For many years the Lubieniecki painting existed only on lists documenting looted art, accompanied by a black-and-white photo to prove its existence.Now, decades after its theft, “Portrait of a Young Man” is back with Polish officials, the FBI announced Monday.Where had the painting been all this time? Mostly in Ohio, according to authorities, and some serendipitous research helped unearth it.[Why two American museums are fighting to keep art stolen by the Nazis]The Lubieniecki painting has long been thought to have been one of many that the Nazis stole from the Warsaw museum in October 1944 and took to an Austrian palace, the FBI said in a statement. That palace, identified by the Polish embassy as Fischhorn Castle, eventually came to house an Allied Forces battalion.A small chapel in the castle was “filled with works of art that had been stolen by the Nazis and used as a depository,” according to the Monuments Men Foundation, which honors service members tasked with protecting art and architecture in war-ravaged Europe.“‘The Portrait of a Young Man’ was apparently later discovered by a U.S. serviceman while in Austria,” the FBI said in a statement. “The soldier is believed to have brought the artwork to the United States after his service abroad.”[Art looted by the Nazis could be hiding in plain sight on the walls of Europe’s great museums]The solider died and the painting was sold to “innocent purchasers” throughout the Columbus, Ohio area, according to the FBI. And there it remained, in Ohio, for many years.But recently a relative of the U.S. solider came across photos of the artwork while conducting some family research. More research revealed that the painting, once housed in the Warsaw museum, had likely been taken by the Nazis.The soldier’s relative reached out to Polish authorities and “upon learning of the historic rights of the painting, the possessors agreed to return the work to Poland,” the FBI said.Officials held a repatriation ceremony in the FBI’s Columbus office.“We are honored to return this painting to the Polish government and the National Museum,” Special Agent in Charge Angela Byers said in a statement. “This was truly a cooperative effort among the U.S. government and our international partners to ensure this work of art was returned to its homeland.”[A frenzy in Poland over the latest mysterious ‘Nazi gold train’]Poland’s Ministry of Culture and National Heritage has a database of more than 63,000 objects lost during WWII. “Several dozen works of art” have been recovered so far, according to the Polish embassy.Last year, U.S. federal officials returned to Poland “St. Philip baptizing a servant of Queen Kandaki” by German artist Johann Conrad Seekatz. “Stolen art, antiquities, and fraudulently-acquired artifacts, these are the little known casualties of war,” U.S. Special Agent in Charge of Homeland Security Investigations James Hayes said at the time.“We treat every painting, every sculpture, every historical artifact with utmost importance — they are the missing pieces of a puzzle that make up the Polish national heritage,” then-Polish minister of culture and heritage Bogdan Zdrojewski said in 2014.

       "4   Cultural concepts are always fuzzy, but that doesn’t make them useless. We may never know the exact beginning or end of Romanticism or the Gilded Age, or where lies the line between art and entertainment, or what distinguishes great talent from genius. But that doesn’t make those concepts hollow, just fluid and approximate.A new entertaining and insightful exhibition at the Smithsonian’s National Portrait Gallery confronts one of the most dynamic and hard to define concepts in American cultural life — the cool. “American Cool” broaches its subject through photographs of people who helped define and embody the cool since before the idea had even taken definite form, to the current day when it is highly questionable if the “cool” is still meaningful. If you want to know how porous the category is, consider all of the following, officially inducted into the realms of the cool by this exhibition: Walt Whitman, Frederick Douglass, H.L. Mencken, Buster Keaton, Jackson Pollock and Susan Sontag. They join artists, entertainers and celebrities who are more traditionally and obviously defined as cool: Lester Young (who plays the central historical role in defining and promoting the idea of cool), Humphrey Bogart (the first and greatest mass-market embodiment of the cool) and Jack Kerouac (who helped export the cool from jazz to broader countercultural application).To govern what seems at first like a highly subjective free-for-all, curators Joel Dinerstein and Frank H. Goodyear III laid down a four-part test for each of the 100 people included. First, they must have made an original artistic contribution, with a signature style; second, they must have in some way been rebellious or transgressive; third, they must have iconic status; and fourth, they must have left a significant cultural legacy. But even those parameters can’t contain the many things we think are definitional about the cool, the aura of mystery, the stoical indifference to criticism, the attitude of self- possession, and seemingly superficial yet important questions of dress and personal style. In a catalog essay accompanying the exhibition, Dinerstein piles on with yet more things that are the opposite of cool: “To be cool is not to be nice or good or heroic; cool is the opposite of innocence or virtue. Cool has an edge and a dark side: to be cool is not to strive to be fabulous .?.?. or saintly.”Dinerstein is, among other things, a scholar of jazz, and Goodyear has a degree in American studies, and so they present the cool as essentially a pop culture phenomenon, and distinctly American. Other cultures have similar ideas — nonchalance, sangfroid, sprezzatura — but they are not “cool.” Sprezzatura dates back to Castiglione’s “Book of the Courtier,” which prized a seemingly effortless virtuosity in all things, from art to social behavior. Sangfroid is distinctly French, a sense of composure and equilibrium, especially under fire.These are, according to the curators, concepts derived from aristocratic entitlement, whereas American cool is generally working class, an “earned individuality” rather than an inherited sense of self-worth. Perhaps, though the aristocratic definition of these ideas was breaking down around the same time that this exhibition posits the origins of the cool. Walt Whitman — the first personality featured in the exhibition, which calls him “the guiding light of American bohemia” — published “Leaves of Grass” in 1855; in 1844, Alexandre Dumas began serializing “The Count of Monte Cristo,” in which a self-made working-class young man assumes an aristocratic name and character to exact revenge on his enemies. Few characters in literature are more suave, self-possessed, disciplined, eccentric and alluring — in a word, cool. And none of that was technically inherited.But the authors have a point. In America, at least, cool is distinctly lower or middle class, reflecting its origins in African American culture, where it was a compensation mechanism for living under the brutal regime of racism. When Lester Young said “I’m cool,” writes Dinerstein, “it meant ‘I’m keeping it together in here against invasive social forces.’” Frederick Douglass, whose oratory was fiery, not cool, merits inclusion in the exhibition because, according to Goodyear, he used a carefully constructed photographic identity to challenge preconceptions about race and African American men. “Though he lived prior to cool’s popularization, his cultivation of this mask of stylish stoicism presaged the rebellions of others who sought to live within yet also apart from the mainstream.”Stylish stoicism is an excellent phrase. But as the exhibition charts the historical evolution of the cool, “stylish stoicism” fits less well with the later, countercultural appropriation of the cool. Transgression becomes more important than style and talent, even directionless, purposeless, self-destructive transgression. When Marlon Brando’s character in the 1953 film “The Wild One” is asked “Hey, Johnny, what are you rebelling against?” and he answers, “Whaddaya got?” — the cool has clearly gone through a critical permutation. Brando is, of course, featured in the exhibition, looking sad, innocent and distracted in a 1950 image by Philippe Halsman.The exhibition situates this evolution of the cool in the period from 1960 t0 1979, but it was clearly nascent earlier than that. “Cool & Counterculture: 1960-1979” is one of the most fascinating and provocative stretches of the show, including diverse figures from Andy Warhol and Paul Newman to Jack Nicholson and Bill Murray. One particularly evocative juxtaposition places a reprint of a 1966 photograph of Muhammad Ali with his fist thrust directly into the camera lens next to a 1971 image of Clint Eastwood, holding an enormous handgun in a visually analogous confrontation with the viewer. Clearly the concept has become elastic if it can encompass a black boxer playfully enacting an aggressive identity and a white actor appealing to working class (and often racist) fantasies of public order and vigilantism.The exhibition ends with what it calls “The Legacies of Cool: 1980-present.” Here we find David Byrne (definitely cool), Steve Jobs (geek cool), Willie Nelson (long-haired, hippie stoner cool) and Jon Stewart (really?). Perhaps the most telling image is a photograph of skateboarder Tony Hawk, doing a move in his kitchen. His young son sits at the kitchen counter while his wife cradles a baby. The dishwasher is open, there are decorative plates above the standard-issue wooden cupboards and the whole thing screams suburbia. The wall text notes his success as an entrepreneur, with a popular line of sports equipment and a video game series. In an interview Dinerstein acknowledged that old ideas about transgression may not be so important any more. What matters now is “new strategies for individuality.”The exhibition is heavily focused on celebrity, though there are some surprises (the Hawaiian surfer Duke Paoa Kahanamoku appears in a circa 1915 photograph). But as the concept of the cool becomes more and more open-ended, it’s unfortunate that it isn’t extended further beyond popular music and film. Susan Sontag definitely seems a worthy inclusion, but are there no classical musicians, ballet dancers or post-structuralist philosophers who are cool? Was the great violinist Jascha Heifetz cool? Or just cold? Was the literary theorist Jacques Derrida cool? Or just inscrutable?It’s also unfortunate that the cool isn’t treated more critically as a concept. There is a dark side of cool, dumb, impassive, disengaged, dismissive and even violent (see the oeuvre of Quentin Tarantino). Think of the phrase “too cool for school,” and all that implies. Although “geek” cool makes a brief appearance in the person of Jobs (on a motorcycle), the rise of geeks and nerds as positive cultural archetypes may be a sign of a healthy resistance against the stupid underbelly of cool.

       "5   Last week, the Sunrise 689, a Vietnamese oil tanker, disappeared off the radar. This Thursday, it motored toward the Vietnamese coast under protection of a naval vessel. Pirates of unknown nationality had seized the ship Oct. 2 and kept its crew hostage while they siphoned a third of its cargo: some 2,000 metric tons of oil. \"They put knives on our throats and threatened to kill us if we resist,\" the ship's deputy captain told the Associated Press by cellphone. One crew member broke his leg after trying to flee the pirates, reported the AP.Luckily, there were no fatalities. The pirates jumped ship with their stolen booty and the tanker had to enlist the help of a passing fishing vessel to figure out its location and call for help.The incident marked the latest pirate attack near the Malacca Strait, a body of water that links the Indian Ocean and the South China Sea, making it perhaps the world's most vital conduit for global shipping. It carries some 40 percent of world trade through its waters every year. The lands flanking these waters have been contested by local kingdoms and sultanates, Arabs, Chinese, and the forces of European colonial powers. Singapore, one of the world's most important ports, emerged in the 19th century as a pivotal entrepot straddling this passage. It was also, in its early days, a haven for pirates.The attack was the 12th such pirate hijacking attempt in Southeast Asia since April, raising concerns about an escalation in piracy in this strategic waterway. The rise has been conspicuous enough that it initially dominated the fevered speculation surrounding Malaysian Airlines flight 370, when it tragically disappeared earlier this year.From a dip in 71 attacks reported in the Malacca Strait and adjacent South China Sea in 2009, numbers surged back to 161 reported attacks in 2013. This graph from German news site Deutsche Welle lays out the trend over the past two decades.Half a decade ago, as the world fretted over the terrors of Somali piracy, strategists pointed to the relative success of counter-piracy measures in the Malacca Strait as a guide for how to deal with the threat of the Horn of Africa. In a 2011 report, the American Enterprise Institute, a D.C-based conservative think tank, hailed the success of the \"Malaccan formula\":The Strait of Malacca between Indonesia, Malaysia, and Singapore offers some interesting solutions. The “formula” in the Strait of Malacca, as outlined by Lt. Commander Jamiola of the U.S. Navy, consists of state-sponsored naval forces, regional intelligence sharing, surface surveillance radars, an effective court system, and fighting the origins of piracy on land. It has proved extremely successful, with the number of pirate attacks in the region declining each year since 2003.An international task force began patrolling the waters off Somalia's lengthy coastline along a similar model, forcing Somali pirate \"motherships\" further afield from their bases on shore. The number of pirate attacks dried up, with piracy off West Africa's coast now becoming a greater security concern.Piracy monitors caution that the recent spike in attacks near the Malacca Strait involves many \"low-level thefts,\" including raids and burglaries conducted at night when ships are at anchor in port. The growing trend does not necessarily mean there's a greater deterioration and pirate threat in the region. This year alone, the U.S. navy held military exercises with Singapore that focused in part on anti-piracy maneuvers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",
       "6   Asleep in the mountains northwest of Boulder, Colo., a teenage camp counselor was awakened Sunday morning by a loud crunching sound.The noise was the sound of large teeth scraping against his skull, he told Denver ABC-affiliate KMGH. A black bear, the teen realized, was trying to pull him out of his sleeping bag by his head.“It grabbed me like this and pulled me, and then it bit the back of my head and dragged me,” the teen, identified only by his first name, Dylan, told KMGH. “When it was dragging me, that was the slowest part. It felt like it went forever.”Fellow staffers and campers were roused by the commotion and tried to scare the bear away as Dylan fought back. The bear dragged Dylan about 10 feet, then dropped him and walked away.Dylan was taken to the hospital. His injuries weren’t life threatening. Authorities are searching for the bear, which will likely be euthanized, according to the Associated Press.The teen is a counselor at Glacier View Ranch, a camp owned by the Rocky Mountain Conference of Seventh Day Adventists, the AP reported. According to the camp’s website, the conference hosts seven weeks of summer camps for youth ages 7 to 18. The camps feature zip lines, go-carts and canoeing, “all in a safe, Christ-centered atmosphere.”The ranch confirmed the attack on its website, and said it would not cancel the rest of the summer’s camps. About 100 children and teens are expected to attend.Campers that Dylan was supervising over the weekend had asked if they could spend the night under the stars, sleeping by the camp’s lake. Dylan relented.He told reporters he teaches wilderness survival at the camp.How fortuitous. One of the tips experts recommend for surviving a bear attack is to fight back.Dylan’s experience follows other troubling reports of bear attacks, including two fatal maulings in Alaska a day apart last month.On June 18, Patrick “Jack” Cooper, a 16-year-old from Anchorage, was killed by a bear after he veered off a trail during a mountain foot race south of the city, according to the AP. A day later, Erin Johns, a 27-year-old contract worker for Pogo Mine died in a mauling 275 miles northeast of Anchorage. Her 38-year-old co-worker was also injured.Authorities told the AP they were baffled by the uptick in bear attacks, although the numbers can fluctuate from year to year. Dylan said his experience hasn’t changed his attitude toward bears. In fact, he was back at camp — sporting fresh scars — when he talked to reporters.“I’m not afraid of the bears. I’m not afraid of sleeping outside anymore. You just have to be aware and respect the animals,” Dylan said.Read more: Scientists have identified the 50-foot creature that washed up on an Indonesian beachHe was on his way to meet the mayor.

       "7   It’s being called an exoskeleton for the paralyzed — a device consisting of leg braces, motion sensors, motorized joints, a computer and a remote control that helps people who are paralyzed from the waist down to sit, stand and walk with assistance.And it’s the first such motorized device to get the U.S. Food and Drug Administration‘s stamp of approval for home use. It’s already in use in rehabilitation facilities.ReWalk was built for people who are disabled by some spinal cord injuries. It was developed by the founder of Israel-based Argo Medical Technologies, who was paralyzed in a vehicle crash.The device uses braces with motion sensors that strap around the legs. Motorized joints supply movement to the hips, knees and ankles. A backpack holds a computer and power supply, and crutches offer stability. The user wears a wireless remote control on the wrist through which he can command ReWalk to stand up, sit down or walk — with a little help.“Innovative devices such as ReWalk go a long way towards helping individuals with spinal cord injuries gain some mobility,” said Christy Foreman, director of the Office of Device Evaluation at the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health. “Along with physical therapy, training and assistance from a caregiver, these individuals may be able to use these devices to walk again in their homes and in their communities.”According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there are about 200,000 people in the United States living with a spinal cord injury.

       "8   We all know not to stare at the sun, right? Seems like common sense, but every time an eclipse comes around, a few people invariably try to watch it without special, protective eye wear and end up damaging their eyeballs.Even during August’s solar eclipse, when the moon will travel across the sun and block part of the sunlight, you cannot look directly at the sun without very strong protective eye wear. Not just sunglasses — lenses that were designed specifically to filter out enough of the light that it doesn’t burn a hole through your retinas.If you did try to look at it without your glasses, it would be “like a magnifying glass on a leaf when you were a kid,” an optometrist tweeted at me. That’s what’s illustrated (in graphic detail) in the video at the top of this story.I’m not trying to provoke panic about watching the solar eclipse. Hundreds of thousands — perhaps millions — of people across the United States are going to walk outside Aug. 21, look up, and see something truly spectacular. That’s something I look forward to.But because I’m curious (and quite a few people have asked), I thought it would be interesting to talk about what would happen if you tried to look at the sun during the eclipse. And don’t tell me it doesn’t happen and people know better. That’s not true.According to an expert answer on the University of California at Santa Barbara ScienceLine, ” … doctors collect information after events like the 1999 solar eclipse, when people who stared directly at the sun for several minutes went to see their doctor. In one study, about half had permanent damage.”An assessment after the same eclipse in Britain found fewer cases than they had feared, but 14 people still managed to damage their eyes by staring at the eclipse.There’s even a tale that Isaac Newton stared at the sun with one eye (for the sake of science, of course), and afterward he could only see reds and blues. I have no idea if that is fiction or fact, but it sure makes a good story.Want to watch the eclipse safely? Here’s how it will go …… if you’re in the path of totality:It will start as a partial eclipse as the moon begins to cover the sun. Keep your glasses on at this point.When the sun is totally blocked by the moon, you can take your glasses off! Enjoy. It’s beautiful.Once sunlight starts to appear again, as the moon departs, put your glasses back on and enjoy the partial eclipse.… if you’re not in the path of totality:You’ll only be seeing a partial eclipse. There will be harmful sun rays for the duration of the event. Keep your eclipse glasses on through the whole thing.Yes, you will go blind if you manage to endure the pain and stare at the sun for long enough. The pain from the visible part of the light spectrum could be extreme, but ultraviolet light — which we can’t see — can also damage the eye. It literally gives your eye a sunburn.The reason a few people always end up going blind during an eclipse is that in the partial phase, the visible light is reduced enough that it’s no longer painful or uncomfortable to look at and so people assume it’s safe. But depending on the sky conditions, it only takes about a minute and a half for your eyes to be permanently damaged, and the damage is cumulative, meaning you don’t have to stare at the sun without looking away for it to be harmful — you may just be taking quick glances, but it’s still damaging your eye.If your eyes are damaged, your vision will at least be blurry and you may see dark or yellow spots. If it’s significant damage, you may not be able to see out of the center of your eye — only your peripheral vision.Other things you should be aware of: Some drugs dilate your pupils, which will decrease the amount of time it will take to burn the eye. People taking these drugs should always take care to wear UV-blocking sunglasses. Also, looking through a camera lens or a telescope will not protect your eyes. The latter is blatantly obvious in the video. Unless it has a filter on it that is made specifically for blocking out the harmful rays, you should not look through any lenses.This story has been altered to make it clearer that both visible and U.V. light can damage the eye, albeit different parts of the eye.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",
       "9   BOSTON — Two years after the horrific bombing of this city’s famed marathon, a federal jury on Friday sentenced to death one of the young men responsible for the attack, turning away appeals for mercy from his attorneys and even some victims.The jury of seven women and five men rendered its decision after deliberating for more than 14 hours. As the verdict was read, the bomber, 21-year-old Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, displayed no sign of emotion.The outcome was a victory for prosecutors, who said the former college student worked in tandem with his older brother and carried out the attack in a “heinous, cruel and depraved manner.” Jurors rejected arguments that Tsarnaev had fallen under the sway of his brother, Tamerlan, and was remorseful over the suffering he caused.Tsarnaev will be transferred to a federal prison, where he will remain until he is put to death by lethal injection. His attorneys did not comment after the verdict, but they are expected to appeal the sentence.After the verdict, Karen Brassard, who was wounded in the attack, said there was “nothing happy about having to take someone’s life.” But she called the outcome “a just conclusion.”“Right now, it feels like we can take a breath and breathe again,” she said.Tsarnaev will become the 62nd federal inmate on death row, according to the Death Penalty Information Center. But it has been more than a decade since the federal government executed an inmate, and the Obama administration is reviewing its protocol for carrying out the death penalty after a botched Oklahoma state execution last year.But the Justice Department, under Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr., decided last year to seek the death penalty in Tsarnaev’s case. After Friday’s verdict was read, Holder’s successor, Loretta E. Lynch, issued a statement calling the sentence “the ultimate penalty” and “a fitting punishment for this horrific crime.”Tsarnaev faced the possibility of death on 17 charges and was sentenced to death on six of them.Prosecutors had depicted him as a cold-blooded killer, repeatedly arguing that his placement of explosives near a young child was evidence of his depravity and one of the aggravating factors that supported a death sentence. Eight-year-old Martin Richard was one of three people killed in the April 15, 2013, bombings near the finish line of the Boston Marathon.More than 260 others were injured; 17 of them lost limbs. Tsarnaev was also charged with killing Sean Collier, a police officer employed by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in the aftermath of the attack. Although jurors found Tsarnaev guilty of murdering Collier, they did not sentence him to die on that count, a disappointment for prosecutors and the law enforcement community.Throughout the trial, prosecutors emphasized the scope of the carnage to jurors, outlining the death and destruction in graphic detail.“This is not a day of celebration. It is a day of reflection and healing,” Carmen M. Ortiz, the U.S. attorney for Massachusetts, told reporters after the verdict. “It is time to turn the page.”Prosecutors argued that Tsarnaev and his brother — who died in a shootout with police days after the bombings — were inspired by radical Islam and moved to violence out of a sense of vengeance over the U.S. wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. In the boat where the younger Tsarnaev was eventually captured, authorities found a note: “Stop killing our innocent people and we will stop.”“Those are the words of a terrorist convinced that he has done the right thing,” Assistant U.S. Attorney Steve Mellin told the jury. “He felt justified in killing and maiming and seriously injuring innocent men, women and children.”In April, the jury that sentenced Tsarnaev had found him guilty of all 30 charges he faced in connection with the 2013 bombings, one of the worst terrorist attacks in the United States since the Sept. 11, 2001, hijackings.Although Tsarnaev’s attorneys never contested that he was involved in the bombings, they mounted a vigorous defense during the penalty phase of the trial, seeking to convince jurors that mitigating factors demanded that they spare his life. Central to that argument was the notion that he was naive and impressionable — he was 19 at the time of the attack — and merely following Tamerlan, whom the attorneys depicted as the mastermind of the plot. Defense attorneys also argued that the younger Tsarnaev deeply regretted his actions.The vast majority of the jurors did not accept those arguments. Only two found that he had “expressed sorrow and remorse for what he did and for the suffering he caused,” according to the lengthy verdict form read aloud in court. Only three jurors found that he was under the influence of his brother and would not have committed the crimes but for Tamerlan.Tsarnaev’s legal team included attorneys with deep experience in capital cases. One of them, Judy Clarke, had previously persuaded juries to spare the lives of clients facing the death penalty, including Sept. 11, 2001, conspirator Zacarias Moussaoui.If sentenced to life, Tsarnaev would have been held at a Supermax prison that has been described by a former warden as a “version of hell” and a place that “is not designed for humanity.” His attorneys used such descriptions to argue before the jury that a life sentence would not be a reprieve.Clarke told the jury that a life sentence would allow “for the possibility of redemption and a greater opportunity for healing for everyone involved.”“Mercy’s never earned, it’s bestowed,” she said. “And the law allows you to choose justice and mercy.”Victims of the marathon bombings were divided on the sentence. Although some argued publicly that they believed Tsarnaev deserved the death penalty, others — including the family of the 8-year-old boy — called for his life to be spared. Ortiz said she took their views seriously.For other survivors and relatives of victims, a life sentence would have proved insufficient.Said Michael Ward, a firefighter who was watching the marathon in 2013 and who helped victims after the explosions: “This nothing to celebrate. This is a matter of justice.”Tsarnaev “wanted to go to hell,” he said, “and he’s going to get there early.”Mark Berman and Sari Horwitz in Washington contributed to this report.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",
       "10  Jeffrey P. Bezos, the next owner of The Washington Post, says he doesn’t have all the answers for what’s ailing the newspaper industry or for the financially challenged news organization he is preparing to buy. But he says he’s eager to start asking questions and conducting experiments in the quest for a new “golden era” at The Post.In his first interview since his $250 million purchase of The Post was announced in early August, Bezos said his basic approach to operating the business will be similar to the philosophy that has guided him in building Amazon.com from a start-up in 1995 to an Internet colossus with $61 billion in sales last year.“We’ve had three big ideas at Amazon that we’ve stuck with for 18 years, and they’re the reason we’re successful: Put the customer first. Invent. And be patient,” he said. “If you replace ‘customer’ with ‘reader,’ that approach, that point of view, can be successful at The Post, too.”Bezos, 49, spoke via phone from Seattle on Friday, four days before he was scheduled to visit The Post for the first time since the announcement of its purchase from The Washington Post Co. and the controlling Graham family. The sale, which shocked the news industry, is expected to close in October.Bezos said his major contribution to the business will be in offering his “point of view” in discussions with the paper’s leadership about how the publication should evolve. He also said he provides “runway” — financial support over a lengthy period in which the management can experiment to find a profitable formula for delivering the news.“If we figure out a new golden era at The Post .?.?. that will be due to the ingenuity and inventiveness and experimentation of the team at The Post,” he said. “I’ll be there with advice from a distance. If we solve that problem, I won’t deserve credit for it.”During his visit Tuesday and Wednesday, Bezos plans to meet with Post publisher Katharine Weymouth and top managers of the paper’s business and editorial operations. He will tour the newsroom in downtown Washington and the production plant in suburban Springfield, Va.Wednesday’s visit will be bracketed by meetings with Post journalists — first with about 20 reporters and editors in the morning and concluding with a town hall-style meeting with the entire newsroom in the afternoon. The last time Bezos encountered a roomful of the paper’s journalists was in 1999, when he was the guest of Katharine Graham, the company’s late chairman, during a luncheon interview with reporters and editors.Based on his comments in the interview Friday, Bezos appears unlikely to make any major decisions or pronouncements during his visit or propose any immediate changes. He said he is eager to meet with and listen to managers and learn about the news organization’s operations.The Post is the first newspaper that Bezos has owned and will be operated as a stand-alone business, independent of Amazon. Bezos intends to keep his “day job” as chairman and chief executive of Amazon and will continue living in Seattle, where the company is based.Bezos is one of the world’s richest men, with a net worth of around $24 billion, based on the current value of his Amazon stock holdings. His deep pockets, technological savvy and reputation as a long-term strategic thinker were among the attributes that Post Co. chief executive Donald E. Graham cited in selling him The Post after 80 years under the Graham family’s control. Graham said he saw no alternative to continued investment, which would be difficult for a publicly traded company.Graham and Weymouth, his niece, quietly put the business up for sale earlier this year after concluding that The Post required an owner capable of making sustained investment in it.Bezos agreed: “It’s important for The Post not just to survive, but to grow,” he said. “The product of The Post is still great. The piece that’s missing is that it’s a challenged business. No business can continue to shrink. That can only go on for so long before irrelevancy sets in.”In the interview, Bezos stressed that he has no immediate fixes for newspapers in general or for The Post, which is beset by Web-based competition that has weakened its advertising base and steadily sapped its print readership.“Don was helpful in interviews [following the purchase] when he said, ‘Mr. Bezos is a businessman, not a magician,’?” Bezos said. “I thanked him for that afterwards. In my experience, the way invention, innovation and change happen is [through] team effort. There’s no lone genius who figures it all out and sends down the magic formula. You study, you debate, you brainstorm and the answers start to emerge. It takes time. Nothing happens quickly in this mode. You develop theories and hypotheses, but you don’t know if readers will respond. You do as many experiments as rapidly as possible. ‘Quickly’ in my mind would be years.”But Bezos suggested that the current model for newspapers in the Internet era is deeply flawed: “The Post is famous for its investigative journalism,” he said. “It pours energy and investment and sweat and dollars into uncovering important stories. And then a bunch of Web sites summarize that [work] in about four minutes and readers can access that news for free. One question is, how do you make a living in that kind of environment? If you can’t, it’s difficult to put the right resources behind it. .?.?. Even behind a paywall [digital subscription], Web sites can summarize your work and make it available for free. From a reader point of view, the reader has to ask, ‘Why should I pay you for all that journalistic effort when I can get it for free’ from another site?”Although he said he reads The Post, New York Times and Wall Street Journal regularly, Bezos didn’t grow up immersed in newspapers or dreaming of being involved with one. His “love affair,” he said, has always been with “the printed word in all its forms.” Amazon started as an online book retailer; it now publishes its own books. It has also moved into video production, competing with Netflix and others in streaming original programs. Bezos’s wife, MacKenzie, is a published novelist.The Internet and Amazon’s launch of the Kindle e-reader convinced him that the printed word doesn’t have to be on paper. “The key thing about a book is that you lose yourself in the author’s world,” Bezos said. “Great writers create an alternative world. It doesn’t matter if you enter that world” via a digital or printed source.After Graham broached the idea of Bezos buying the paper earlier this year, Bezos said he spent two months contemplating what he could bring to the business. He was convinced that The Post was “an important institution,” and he said he was optimistic about its future. But he needed time to think over a third issue.“I had to convince myself that I could bring something to the table,” he said. “I discussed this at great length with Don. I thought I could, because I could offer runway and some skill in technology and the Internet and a point of view about long-term thinking, reader focus and the willingness to experiment.”Added Bezos: “I’m a genetic optimist. I’ve been told, ‘Jeff, you’re fooling yourself; the problem is unsolvable.’ But I don’t think so. It just takes a lot of time, patience and experimentation.”Asked how he saw The Post — as a local, national or international news organization — Bezos demurred. “That’s a question that needs to be answered in concert with the leadership team of The Post. Is it local? Or national? Is it something new?” Whatever the mission, he said, The Post will have “readers at its centerpiece. I’m skeptical of any mission that has advertisers at its centerpiece. Whatever the mission is, it has news at its heart.”Craig Timberg contributed to this article.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",
       "11  It has been a difficult year for the left politically, but at least with respect to the minimum wage, progressive activists had major victories — including in a couple of very red states.As a result, the minimum wage will increase in 19 states as 2016 comes to a close, according to figures compiled by the National Conference of State Legislatures. Two more states and the District of Columbia will raise the minimum later in the new year.The greatest increase will apply to companies in New York City with at least 10 employees. Minimum-wage workers at these businesses will receive a raise of $2 an hour on Saturday as the floor increases from $9 to $11. More-modest increases will apply to smaller firms in New York City and companies elsewhere in the state.Workers also will receive substantial raises in states carried by President-elect Donald Trump. In Arizona, the hourly minimum will increase from $8.05 to $10. The floor will increase from $7.50 to $9 in Maine, from $8.50 to $8.90 in Michigan and from $8 to $8.50 in Arkansas.Those increases follow a series of convincing wins for labor on the issue in Republican territory. Polling by the Public Religion Research Institute last year found that 3 in 5 Republicans and nearly 3 in 4 independent voters would support increasing the federal minimum wage from $7.25 to $10.10.In 2014, for instance, voters approved increases in Alaska, Nebraska and South Dakota. In Arizona in November, voters approved an initiative to increase the minimum wage by a comfortable margin of 58 percent to 42 percent.Trump, who carried Arizona with 49 percent of the vote, has taken inconsistent positions on the minimum wage.When asked in a debate a year ago whether he supported an increase in the minimum wage, he said, “I would not do it.” In May, though, Trump altered his position, seeming to suggest that, while he would support an increase in the minimum, he thought that states should set the levels and that the federal government should not enforce a minimum at all.Trump's nominee to be secretary of labor, Andrew Puzder, is a fast-food executive who has written that substantial increases in the minimum wage will force employers to hire fewer workers.While proponents of minimum-wage increases have had impressive successes, they did not expand that momentum this year to the 21 states that have not set floors above the federal minimum of $7.25. Workers making the minimum in those states will not get a legally mandated raise this year.Seven of the 19 states raising minimums this weekend will record modest increases of between a nickel and a dime per hour to adjust for increases in the cost of living.More from Wonkblog:The hidden cost of made-in-America retail bargainsThose jobs Trump is bragging about are just a fraction of Sprint's huge

       "12  North Korea caused even more bafflement than usual when, on Wednesday, it announced that a lowly traffic cop would receive the state's highest honor, a medal called \"The Hero of the Republic.\" The award is typically reserved for military derring-do or nuclear scientists. More confusing still was the official announcement, which stated with conspicuous vagueness that the \"traffic girl,\" as they're typically called, was being honored for \"safeguarding the security of the headquarters of the revolution in an unexpected circumstance.\" What circumstance? What does \"safeguarding\" mean?An official state video showed the traffic cop, a young woman name Ri Kong Sim, convulsing with emotion as she received her award.The conspiracy theories flowed quickly, with a North Korean defector organization suggesting that she may have saved leader Kim Jong Un from an assassination attempt. According to some thinly sourced reports, North Korean agents may have staged car accidents in the past to kill their targets.It turns out, though, that the explanation may be considerably more modest. New Focus International, a North Korean news organization that sources from defectors and from volunteer citizens within the country, says that its sources in Pyongyang indicate that Ri \"received the award for putting out a fire that broke out near a propaganda poster.\" The poster allegedly bore the name of leader Kim Jong Un.This explanation might sound absurd, but it's not implausible. I suggested this could be the case in my original post on Ri's mysterious award, noting that North Korea often grants high honors to people who simply save official portraits of its national rulers. Those omnipresent portraits, like the Eucharist at a Catholic mass, are considered quasi-holy symbols of everything that’s supposed to matter in the North Korean state ideology.New Focus International's story also notes that North Korea is still technically in a \"Grade 1 War-Readiness State,\" owing to recent tensions with the United States. This state includes special, heightened rules requiring citizens to protect images and icons of the leaders. That's partly about propaganda and ideology – Kim is the embodiment the state, after all – but it also has the nice effect, probably comforting for Kim, of making it the personal duty of every North Korea citizen to care so much about their leader that they'll even self-sacrifice to protect a banner carrying his name.\"The Real North Korea,\" a new book by the highly respected scholar Andrei Lankov, also discusses the degree to which official state ideology treats posters and banners of the Kim family as holy relics, the embodiment of the semi-divine leaders themselves. In this clip, Lankov discusses an unsettling incident in which a father was rewarded for allowing his 5-year-old daughter to drown so that he could save a poster of former leaders Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il:In an emergency, statues and portraits are to be protected whatever the cost, as any sacred object should be — and North Koreans are reminded that they must safeguard the images. For example, in 2007 the official media widely reported an incident that allegedly occurred in August of that year.During a severe flooding, Kang Hyong Kwon, a factory worker from the city of Ich’on, was trying to make his way to safety through a dangerous stream. While leaving his flooded house, he took the two most precious things in his life — his five-year-old daughter and portraits of Leaders Generalissimo Kim Il Sung and Marshal Kim Jong Il. Suddenly overwhelmed by the current, he lost grip of his daughter, who fell into the swollen waters, but still managed to keep hold of the sacred images. The media extolled North Koreans to emulate Kang Hyong Kwon, a real-life hero.Think about that for a moment. If North Korean officials are going to promote this man as a hero for saving a poster of the Kims while his daughter drowned, would it really be so surprising if they granted a top military honor to a traffic cop who saved a burning banner bearing Kim Jong Un's name?That's a significantly different story from the initial rumor that she had prevented Kim's assassination. As the North Korea scholar Stephanie Kleine-Ahlbrandt quipped on Twitter, \"We know so little about North Korea that a military medal given to a traffic cop becomes rumor of a coup.\"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",
       "13  ATHENS — Maybe the German leader meant to reassure Greece when he promised emergency assistance of food and medicine. But to many in the embattled Mediterranean nation, it sounded more like a threat.The hard line on Greece adopted by Europe’s economic powerhouse has, if anything, strengthened in the days since Greek voters resoundingly rejected tougher cuts, sending shock waves through the continent.Now Germany is refusing to budge on cutting Greece’s mountain of debt, even as the leftist leadership here — and the International Monetary Fund — insist that no deal is viable without such a reduction. This tough stance comes from a rules-oriented nation where even the language is conspiring against Greece’s struggles: Germans use the same word for “debt” and for “guilt.”“Of course we do not want to abandon the Greeks, but they do not have to be a member of the euro zone in order to receive help,” said Christian von Stetten, a lawmaker from German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union, summarizing an increasingly prevalent view in the German capital.“If, from the very beginning, there had been sanctions for not sticking to the rules, we would not have this problem,” von Stetten said. He noted that Greece was not the only member of the 19-nation euro zone to run afoul of the thicket of regulations that govern borrowing and spending in the monetary union.The mounting German anger after the Greek referendum on Sunday is a major challenge for Merkel, who, as the euro zone’s most powerful leader, needs to hold together its fractious members while preserving her domestic standing. She does not want to be blamed for a sudden Greek exit from the euro zone, but giving away too much would cost her at home.France and others are starting to break away, calling for a softened deal in the aftermath of the referendum. Merkel’s electorate, however, has had no such turnabout. Nor have her political allies.“Today we need the Iron Chancellor: No new billions for Greece!” read the front-page headline in Tuesday’s Bild tabloid, the top-circulating newspaper in Germany. It was accompanied by a doctored image of Merkel sporting a spiked helmet of the kind worn by Otto von Bismarck, the 19th-century leader who conquered Europe to build the German empire.“A lot of people in the government have moved toward the position where they say, ‘Let’s get rid of them no matter what,’?” said Sebastian Dullien, a senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations in Berlin.Many Germans say that without steely regulations to govern the conduct of European nations, the 63-year-old project to integrate the continent would swiftly fall apart. Giving in to populists in Greece would embolden others like them in places such as Spain and Italy, they say, and soon there would be a wave of political and economic upheaval across Europe.Merkel has repeatedly shot down Greek bailout proposals that insist on debt relief. As the clock ticked Tuesday on the collapse of the Greek banking sector, she again said ahead of a meeting of euro-zone leaders that she did not see any basis for negotiations.The tough approach aligns well with Germany’s broader attitudes toward rules and predictability. Germany is a nation where jaywalking is rare, even when streets are clear of cars, and where most subway stations use the honor system, operating without turnstiles.The adherence to rules is such a key tenet of life there that many Germans say they would rather send humanitarian aid if Greece goes bankrupt than forgive its debts and risk breaking the covenant that when money is borrowed, it must be repaid.Until the introduction of the euro, bankrupt individuals in Germany could wipe out their debts only after 30 years. Credit card usage in the country is among the lowest in Europe, and even many big-box stores there take only cash.That maximalist approach toward Greece, however, could prove costlier for German taxpayers, because the struggling nation would be unable to repay Germany’s $88 billion share of European rescue loans if it went bankrupt. A debt reduction would slice only a share off Greece’s towering obligations.But many German leaders are dead set against compromise.“Greece’s entry into the euro zone was very naive from today’s perspective,” German Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel told the newsmagazine Stern on Tuesday. Gabriel is also the leader of the center-left Social Democrats.“Nothing is gained if we just cut debt without fundamental changes in Greece,” Gabriel said. On Monday, he said E.U. countries needed to start readying humanitarian aid for Greece. He spoke from his party’s headquarters in Berlin, where red flags still fly and Karl Marx’s images adorn office walls. Similar parties in other countries have long favored stimulus spending and fought austerity, so his position is emblematic of the stark differences in German discourse.If Greece exits the euro zone, the aid may well be necessary. Greece imports much of its food and almost all of its medicine. Without a working banking system, or with a sharply devalued new currency, Greeks would struggle to pay for the basics while the cost of imports would rise sharply. After just over a week of capital controls that prevent Greeks from sending payments outside the country, shortages of staples are starting to appear.Some critics say that Germany’s aversion to softening Greece’s debt obligations ignores its own history. In a recent interview with Germany’s Die Zeit newspaper, economist Thomas Piketty pointed to Germany’s post-World War II debt restructuring. That deal, done under different circumstances, wiped away about half of what Germany owed other nations, including Greece.As basics dwindle on the shelves of Greek supermarkets, Merkel is playing a tricky balancing act, with much to lose if she takes a strong stand on either side of whether Greece should remain in the euro zone. Her legacy would suffer if she were seen as kicking the Greeks off the common currency. But if she advocates debt relief, voters may punish her at home. Already, her even tougher finance minister, Wolfgang Schäuble, has started to surpass her in popularity polls.Merkel “wants to avoid it being her to decide over this,” said Stefan Kornelius, author of a biography of the chancellor. He also wrote a column published Tuesday saying it was time for Greece to leave the euro zone.“She wants the Greek government to decide. She set the rules, and she wants Greece either to commit to it or leave it,” Kornelius added.Stephanie Kirchner in Berlin contributed to this report.Read more:7 key things to know about Greece’s debt crisis and what happens nextA hilarious Monty Python sketch explains why Greece is in a huge crisisThe forgotten origins of Greece’s crisis will make you think twice about who’s to blame                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",
       "14  Alfonso Fanjul fled Cuba as a young man, leaving behind his family’s mansions and vast sugar-cane fields as they were being wrested away by the communist Castro regime.In exile in the United States, he built an even larger sugar empire, amassing one of North America’s great fortunes and befriending members of Congress and presidents who benefited from his largess. The sting of his family’s forced departure from Cuba led him to become one of the principal funders of the U.S. anti-Castro movement.Now, contrary to what almost anyone could have imagined, the 76-year-old Fanjul has begun to reassess old grievances and tentatively eye Cuba as a place for him and other U.S. businessmen to expand their enterprises. Quietly, without fanfare, Fanjul has started visiting the island of his birth and having conversations with top Cuban officials.“If there is some way the family flag could be taken back to Cuba, then I am happy to do that,” Fanjul said in a rare interview, publicly discussing his recent visits to the island for the first time.Fanjul’s about-face is a startling development for the exile network that has held a grip on the politics of U.S.-Cuba relations for decades and has played an outsize role in presidential campaigns. His trips place him at the vanguard of a group of ultra-wealthy U.S. investors with roots on the island whose economic interests and political clout are pushing the two countries toward a thaw in their half-century standoff.Fanjul, in the interview, said repeatedly that his primary motivation in visiting Cuba has been a desire to “reunite the Cuban family,” referring broadly to the Cuban diaspora and those who remain on the island. Business considerations could be explored only if there are political and diplomatic advances, he said.“The [Fanjul] family was in Cuba for 150 years, and, yes, at the end of the day, I’d like to see our family back in Cuba, where we started. .?.?. But it has to be under the right circumstances,” said Fanjul, who is best known by his nickname, “Alfy.” “One day we hope that the United States and Cuba would find a way so the whole Cuban community could be able to live and work together.”Fanjul, who lives in Palm Beach, Fla., and whose family holdings include Domino Sugar and refineries across the United States, Latin America and Europe, has managed to maintain a remarkably low profile for a politically connected tycoon. His access to the highest levels of power was evident during the Monica Lewinsky scandal of the 1990s, when the special prosecutor’s report noted that President Bill Clinton received a call from Fanjul during a private Oval Office moment with the intern.Last week, the Fanjul family’s influence over policymakers was on display when the U.S. House passed a farm bill that would cut subsidies to many agricultural products while leaving unscathed the controversial, taxpayer-backed program that protects sugar profits.Fanjul visited Cuba in April 2012 and again in February 2013 as part of a delegation licensed through the Brookings Institution, the Washington think tank that has produced recent papers criticizing U.S. policy and calling on the Obama administration to further loosen sanctions. In Havana, he lingered with tears in his eyes at his family’s colonial-era manse, now a museum, with its elegant columns, lush inner courtyard, sparkling chandeliers and grand staircase.He was so taken by the nostalgia and excitement of returning to the familiar streets of his youth, a travel companion recalled, that Fanjul enthusiastically chatted up random people of all ages as he walked around. He also met with Cuba’s foreign minister and toured state-run farms and a sugar mill with Cuban agricultural officials.Unlike most other Cuban Americans who travel to the island, Fanjul has direct access to some of America’s most important policymakers. After returning from his first trip, Fanjul met with his good friend, then-Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, to express his changing views on Cuba. In November, Fanjul once again discussed his evolving mind-set with Clinton and her husband at a Clinton Foundation fundraiser in the Miami home of Cuban American businessman Paul Cejas, a former U.S. ambassador to Belgium.Many embargo supporters say U.S. policy should change only when certain conditions are met, such as regime change or political reforms. Fanjul, however, said he prefers not to answer the question of whether he would require the fall of the Castro government or an end to communism before doing business in Cuba — saying that he respects existing U.S. law.“Right now there’s no way for us to consider investing in Cuba. How can you work a deal if you’re not legally allowed to do it?” he said.“Now, would we consider an investment at some later date?” continued Fanjul, a permanent U.S. resident who maintains Spanish citizenship. “If there’s an arrangement within Cuba and the United States, and legally it can be done and there’s a proper framework set up and in place, then we will look at that possibility. We have an open mind.”He said the Cuban government — which has business deals with companies from countries such as Canada and Spain — would have to change its economic structure to make it easier and safer for outside companies to make money.“Cuba has to presumably satisfy the requirements that investors need, which are primarily a return on investment and security of the investment, so they feel comfortable with what they’re doing,” he said. “I personally would look at that in the same framework as any investor would.”Evolving politicsThe logistical, political and legal complexities involved in any potential expansion of U.S.-based businesses onto Cuban soil are staggering. Fanjul’s willingness to hold meetings with the Castro government puts him on a potential collision course with Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Robert Menendez (D-N.J.), a Cuban American whose campaigns have been supported by Fanjul but who is an unwavering advocate for the embargo and has the power to thwart any attempts to lift it.Trickier still would be the impact on presidential politics, with Florida’s Cuban American electorate still a significant factor in the battle for that state’s crucial electoral college votes.Already, there have been signs that younger Cuban Americans, particularly those born in the United States, are moving away from the hard-line views of their parents and grandparents. Now, as Fanjul’s recent gestures show, even some of the most entrenched exiles are evolving, and politicians accustomed to embracing the Cuba trade embargo in their pursuit of Florida’s large Cuban American electorate will have to calibrate the risks and rewards of evolving along with them.Hillary Clinton, the putative Democratic front-runner for president if she chooses to run in 2016, spoke out in favor of the Obama administration’s actions relaxing restrictions on family travel and cash flow to the island. Yet she, like many politicians in both parties, has repeatedly expressed support for continued sanctions. She is close with several key players, besides Fanjul, who have stated an openness to more engagement with Cuba.Fanjul, a longtime supporter of Bill Clinton’s campaigns and causes, would probably be a major donor, as well as a close adviser on Cuba-related matters, to Hillary Clinton should she run. Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D), a longtime Clinton confidant, traveled to Cuba for a trade mission in recent years and held discussions with high-ranking government officials there. And Cejas, whom Bill Clinton appointed ambassador to Belgium, has expressed doubts about the U.S. trade embargo against Cuba.“I can tell you one thing that became very clear to me: The embargo is really an embargo against America ourselves. Because Americans cannot do business with Cuba, where there are incredible opportunities for growth,” said Cejas, who traveled to Cuba with Fanjul.The issue could prove thornier for Republicans,    \n",

We are only allowed to report on what has been out there because this is stolen material and trafficking in it is, in itself, a criminal act.”This stolen material has been dredged up by a hacking effort known as “Guardians of Peace” against Sony Pictures Entertainment, which produced “The Interview,” a film starring Seth Rogen and James Franco as journalists who sign on to a government plot to assassinate North Korean strongman Kim Jong Un. Reams of internal Sony information have spilled from the hack — e-mails, data on salaries and business considerations — not to mention the fact that producer Scott Rudin called star Angelina Jolie a “minimally talented spoiled brat.”Sony demands that media organizations do not republish the hacked material. In a strongly worded Dec. 14 letter to publishers, superlawyer David Boies wrote that Sony “does not consent to your possession, review, copying, dissemination, publication, uploading, downloading, or making any use of the Stolen Information.” Those who dis Sony on this matter are in trouble, according to Boies, who writes that the company will have “no choice but to hold you responsible for any damage or loss arising from such use or dissemination by you.”The Times has taken that threat seriously. In a same-day piece on the Boies letter, the newspaper turned up its nose at other outlets that have participated in the disclosures: “Until now, the data has provided a feast for traffic-hungry websites like Fusion and those owned by Gawker Media, along with some mainstream news organizations like Bloomberg, which last week posted an article — without citing names — revealing details of employee medical records that were made public by the hackers.”As for its own approach, that same Times piece disclosed, “The Times has reported on some Sony emails and company-related data based on the accounts of other news organizations and on statements from Sony executives. Sony representatives have acknowledged the authenticity of the emails and data.” Huffington Post media reporter Michael Calderone obtained further clarification from The Times, which outlined a balancing act: “The Sony situation poses difficult questions. We don’t condone hacking into private computer systems. We also don’t like depriving our readers of information they care about.”Actor Brad Pitt, Jolie’s husband, found something unsavory in the reporting frenzy: “I don’t see a difference in News Corp hacking phone calls and hacking e-mails. I don’t think we should be able to participate,” said Pitt. “I think someone’s conversation, whether in e-mail or in person, should be private. We shouldn’t be participating and these sites that are disseminating them should stop. They won’t. And we should stop reading them. We won’t. It’s more of an indictment on us, I think.”Pitt sees no difference in these two things; the law sees an enormous one. As the Erik Wemple Blog has noted previously, Supreme Court jurisprudence protects U.S. media organizations that lawfully receive information that’s been unlawfully obtained. Say what? Yes — if some scoundrel hacks into a computer or illegally tapes a phone call and then posts it to the Internet, there’s nothing illegal about passing it along. That very protection is encased in a 2001 Supreme Court case, Bartnicki v. Vopper, which involved a scandalous recording of a phone conversation, one that had been allegedly recorded illegally, that ended up in the hands of talk radio host Frederick Vopper. Justice John Paul Stevens wrote for the court that Vopper acted within the law: “[A] stranger’s illegal conduct does not suffice to remove the First Amendment shield from speech about a matter of public concern.”Clay Calvert, a University of Florida professor, told the Erik Wemple Blog for a previous post, “If the news media lawfully obtain truthful information about a matter of public significance, then the government may not constitutionally punish publication of the information, absent an interest of the highest order.” For further analysis, see this post by Eugene Volokh, who notes that two of the six justices in the majority opinion opined that the information needs to be of “great public concern.”Bold text added to highlight the triviality of much of the Sony hacking oeuvre. Is a Hollywood producer’s attitude toward Angelina Jolie a matter of public significance? Are the negotiations of New York Times journalists with Sony executives of matter of public significance? Is the fact that Sony bigwig Amy Pascal had to apologize over racially insensitive e-mails a matter of public significance? Well, she apologized and her replacement appears likely, according to the Hollywood Reporter. Case closed on public significance.Appeals to suppress the work of these hackers automatically elicit sympathy. In the pantheon of American leaking heroes, the Guardians of Peace aren’t Daniel Ellsberg (Pentagon Papers); they aren’t W. Mark Felt (Watergate); they aren’t Jeffrey Wigand (tobacco); they aren’t Edward Snowden (National Security Agency). Instead, they’re a group that has threatened terrorism on theaters that show “The Interview.”Yet it’s not the media’s job to judge the people who steal information. The media’s job is to judge the stolen information itself: If it’s worth publishing, then publish.Some may argue that media trafficking in the Sony documents will only encourage other hackers to break into other companies’ systems. If that’s true, then those companies should buttress their systems. But either way, that’s not the problem of news outlets.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",
       "16  Metro and local emergency responders are proposing to collaborate for the first time in testing radio equipment at Metro stations and tunnels, officials said Monday, following communication problems during several incidents.The proposal to devise joint testing was described in a letter to Sen. Mark R. Warner after the Virginia Democrat asked Metro and the Washington Council of Governments about communication breakdowns during the Jan. 12 incident near the L’Enfant Plaza station that killed one person and injured 86 others.Federal investigators are reviewing the cause and the response to the smoke that filled a tunnel near the L’Enfant Plaza station, where a train had become disabled. Their early inspection found “severe electrical arcing damage” to the rail and cables inside the tunnel.Metro is collecting information on radio testing being conducted throughout the system to present to a committee of fire chiefs that works with the regional government council, said Metro spokesman Dan Stessel. A meeting of that committee is set for this month, according to the letter to Warner.“We would like to see this meeting happen as soon as possible,” Stessel said.Stessel also said Monday that Metro has resolved radio problems that affected coverage in parts of the Wheaton Station on the Red Line. Montgomery County Fire and Rescue had flagged the issue to Metro Friday afternoon after its crews ran a routine test, according to a fire department e-mail.The problem involved a connector on a cable that carries signals from aboveground to the underground station.The problem at Wheaton was the only one found after testing at the county’s 12 Metro stations, Stessel said. While a repair was pending, firefighters were reminded to communicate using a radio-relay system that positions them within sight of each other at key points between the tunnel and surface.Signal-relaying equipment is built into the subway and maintained by Metro. But regularly troubleshooting communication problems falls on Metro and each local jurisdiction.Although Metro and local jurisdictions test radio communications within the system, they do so independently of each other.Warner said he sees “a real challenge” more than a decade after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks and massive investments in emergency communications.“Your system may be working but the handoff — the interoperability — is the place where so many things can go wrong,” Warner said.Warner said the letter laid out a tentative timeline for making changes, but even the earliest actions would be two months off.Warner was part of the local congressional delegation given a limited briefing of events about the crisis. An early review found that District firefighters in the L’Enfant Plaza tunnel had trouble communicating with commanders aboveground. Since then, Metro and the D.C. Fire Department have largely blamed each other for the communications problem.Their dispute centers on whether the District made technical changes to the way its radios work, when those changes were made, and what it told Metro about those changes in order for the rail system to make equipment adjustments in response.An e-mail released by the District as part of its review of the incident shows that firefighters flagged a radio problem to Metro in an e-mail on Jan. 8, four days before the incident at L’Enfant Plaza.Metro officials said crews worked through that weekend trying to pinpoint a problem on its side, and when it couldn’t find any arranged for a Jan. 14 meeting with the District for additional checks, two days after the L’Enfant Plaza incident occurred.Metro and D.C. emergency officials say the communication problems have been fixed.

       "17  A federal grand jury in San Antonio indicted a truck driver for his alleged role in the smuggling deaths of 10 undocumented immigrants found in the trailer of a truck in a Walmart parking lot in July, officials said Wednesday.James Matthew Bradley Jr., 60, received five felony counts, including smuggling migrants for financial gain resulting in death — a charge that could carry the death penalty. Other charges range from 10 to 20 years in federal prison, the Justice Department said in a release.Seven Mexicans and one Guatemalan were found dead in the trailer in San Antonio under stiflingly hot summer conditions, with as many as 200 people tightly packed and struggling to breathe through small holes. Two migrants later died in a hospital.Currently, two remain hospitalized, five were released to immigration authorities, and 22 are being held as material witnesses, according to the Justice Department.Some of the travelers had spent days held in a house near the border with Mexico. Some were told to pay hundreds of dollars to a group linked to Los Zetas, a deadly Mexican drug cartel, for safe passage across the Rio Grande in rafts, The Washington Post reported.Bradley initially told authorities he was unaware of the trailer’s cargo and was surprised when he realized people had been trapped inside. He owned the truck found outside Walmart but not the trailer, according to public records. He told federal agents that the trailer’s refrigeration system did not work and that the vent holes were probably clogged, according to the criminal complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas.The truck’s discovery revealed the group’s horrifying journey to the United States at a time when immigration arrests have spiked under President Trump and illegal border crossings have plummeted, according to federal officials. The case also highlighted the extreme dangers people face as they try to enter the country.Jack Staton, acting assistant director of intelligence for Immigration and Custom Enforcement’s Homeland Security Investigations arm, called human smuggling “100 percent crime against humanity,” adding that “this is just victimizing people that are attempting to get a better life.”“The smugglers closed the doors and the interior of the trailer was pitch black and it was already hot inside,” James Lara, a special agent with Homeland Security Investigations wrote in the complaint after interviewing one of the migrants.“He stated they were not provided with any water or food. People inside were making noise to get someone’s attention but nobody ever came.”Maria Sacchetti, Mark Berman and Lindsey Bever provided additional reporting.

       "18  Millions of drivers whose cars have been recalled to replace air bags that explode and spray deadly shards of metal may not be fully protected unless they have the potentially dangerous inflaters replaced twice, a federal regulator told Congress on Thursday.The testimony of Mark Rosekind, head of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, came a day after the regulatory agency said an additional 85 million vehicles could face air-bag recalls unless the manufacturer can prove they are safe. Almost 29 million cars already have been recalled after inflater ruptures killed 10 people in the United States and maimed at least 100 more.Rosekind said Thursday that the inflaters being installed in recalled vehicles may themselves become defective but that the evidence suggests they will perform to design for several years.“At this point we’re only seeing ruptures at 7? 1/ 2 years,” Rosekind said. “A certain number that are being replaced have at least a 7? 1/ 2 -year time span available for that safety to protect people in the vehicle.”The news that some recalled vehicles may need to have their air-bag inflaters replaced twice adds a fresh layer of complexity to the issue. The air bags were manufactured by the world’s largest maker of air bags, a Japanese firm named Takata, and installed by a majority of automakers. Unlike most air-bag makers, Takata uses ammonium nitrate to trigger a small explosion that inflates the air bag when the vehicle strikes something.But in some vehicles — particularly those that were several years old and kept in regions with high humidity — the ammonium nitrate burns too fast, causing the chemical’s container to explode and spray drivers and passengers with metal shrapnel.Many Takata replacement air bags still use the ammonium nitrate that is suspected to cause the explosive malfunctions, and Rosekind said Thursday that testing has proved that the chemical deteriorates over time.Many air-bag inflaters have been replaced since the recalls began in 2014, and dealers should have notified drivers about whether their new inflaters were triggered by ammonium nitrate and whether they should be replaced a second time when inflaters without the chemical become available, Rosekind said.“If the dealer tells you that it’s an interim remedy, then you would know that you’ll be recalled again for a second fix,” Rosekind said. “You don’t want people to get that first [replacement] and think they’re done.”With replacement air bags on back order, many dealers have been telling drivers who have received recall notices that it may take weeks or months before their inflaters can be replaced.Getting drivers to comply with recall notices is a challenge, said Mitch Bainwol, president of the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, a trade group that represents 12 major foreign and domestic automakers.“We do mail and email until we’re blue in the face,” Bainwol told the House subcommittee. “It’s tough. We need help.”NHTSA is launching a pilot program in which automakers work with state motor-vehicle administrations to include recall information in renewal notices for licenses and auto registration. Six states will take part in the pilot program.“As much as is currently being done, it’s not enough,” Rosekind said, enumerating 19 new strategies developed to draw the attention of drivers to recall notices.Huma Hanif, 17, died March 31 when an air bag malfunctioned after her car hit another vehicle at an intersection in suburban Houston. The auto dealer and Honda said they had sent six air-bag recall notices to Hanif’s family, but family members said they had not received the notices.On Wednesday, NHTSA gave Takata until the end of 2019 to prove that their new process for ensuring the safety of inflaters triggered by ammonium nitrate is effective. The company is using a drying agent called desiccant to keep the chemical from deteriorating when exposed to heat and humidity. If Takata fails to provide that proof, it could lead to a recall of an additional 85 million cars.Rep. Janice Schakowsky (D-Ill.) asked Rosekind whether potentially defective air bags were being installed in newly manufactured cars.“It would be illegal to sell a known defect in a new car,” Rosekind said.An earlier version of this story stated that Takata has until the end of 2018 to prove that their new process for ensuring safety of inflaters is effective. The company has until the end of 2019.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",
       "19  By all accounts, Wednesday's encounter between French police and a group of suspected terrorists in the Paris suburbs was an incredibly violent one: 5,000 bullets fired, dozens of grenades thrown, bodies so damaged that at first authorities were unable to say how many people had been killed.So it's somewhat remarkable that there was only one fatality on the police side of the showdown: Diesel, a 7-year-old Belgian Malinois police dog who was sent into the apartment at one point to check for survivors. The dog was killed when one of the people in the apartment detonated a suicide vest.Diesel's death sparked a popular hashtag and an outpouring of respect and grief on social media. And it highlighted the role specially trained dogs play in often dangerous law enforcement situations in France, as well as right here in the United States.It's unclear exactly how many police dogs are active in the United States. Jim Watson, director of the North American Police Work Dog Association, gave a \"wild guess\" of around 50,000 dogs in 2010. The dogs are deployed to various domestic law enforcement agencies, doing everything from bomb- and drug-sniffing to chasing down suspected criminals.And, unfortunately, police dog work can sometimes be deadly. The Officer Down Memorial Page, which tracks police fatalities in the line of duty, includes numbers on police dog fatalities as well. Their numbers show that in 2015 so far, 26 police dogs have been killed in the line of duty — a number that's up sharply over the previous two years.In the most recent incident they've tracked, a dog named Hyco with the Anderson County Sheriff's Office in South Carolina was shot and killed while chasing a group of suspected carjackers. In September, a police dog named Ike in Washington state was stabbed multiple times while attempting to subdue a suspect and had to be euthanized due to the extent of his injuries.But while a number of dogs have died at the hands of a suspected criminal this year, the ODMP's numbers show that canine officers face an even bigger threat: heat exhaustion, particularly from being left in a squad car on a hot day.This year alone at least 11 dogs died from heat exhaustion, according to the ODMP. In August, two dogs with the Baltimore City Detention Center died when the air conditioning failed in a vehicle they were in. In Florida, an officer was suspended without pay in May when he inadvertently left two police dogs in a car at his home.The heat deaths \"happen at a pretty alarming rate,\" said Steve Weiss, an NYPD lieutenant who serves as ODMP's Director of Research. \"I was surprised by how often it happens.\"Weiss says that many K9 unit vehicles are now being outfitted with electronic systems that automatically regulate heat and humidity. Some systems can alert remote officers if the AC fails or the temperature gets too high, and allow them to immediately pop the trunk or doors to allow dogs to escape. More widespread adoption of these systems would cut down on the heat exhaustion deaths, according to Weiss.Weiss says better laws protecting police dogs would help too. \"The laws in many states involving the deaths of police animals are not very strict,\" he said. \"Every state is different.\"Update: This piece has been updated to reflect that authorities do not currently believe the woman in the apartment, Hasna Aitboulahcen, detonated the suicide vest.

       "20  The student activist who led the successful push to rename the University of Maryland football stadium is trying to jump-start a movement to erect a statue of Harriet Tubman on the grounds of the Maryland State House.The area surrounding the capitol building has long been controversial because it houses a statue of Roger Taney, the Supreme Court justice who authored the proslavery Dred Scott decision.A compromise struck in the mid-1990s kept the Taney statue on the grounds while adding a statue of Thurgood Marshall, the first African American appointed to the nation’s highest court.Legislation that called for placing statues of Tubman and fellow abolitionist Frederick Douglass alongside Taney failed in 2012 and 2013.Colin Byrd, a University of Maryland student who is pushing for the Tubman statue, says he is banking on extra momentum after the Treasury Department decided to put Tubman on $20 bills.Byrd says adding a statue of Tubman to the State House grounds without taking down Taney’s statue should mollify critics who say removing memorials to slavery supporters is tantamount to erasing history.“Even those people would agree a lot of history can be learned from Harriet Tubman’s life and times,” Byrd said. “It’s about balance .?.?. there were two sides to this slavery debate, and Tubman was on the right side of it, while Taney was wrong.”Byrd organized fellow students to push university regents last year to change the name of the school’s football stadium, which had honored segregationist and former university president H.C. “Curley” Byrd.The board voted 12-to-5 in December to change the name of the facility to “Maryland Stadium.”So far, state lawmakers have not signed onto Colin Byrd’s effort to add a Tubman statue outside the State House. But Byrd — who is African American and not related to the long-ago university president — has received high-profile backing from actress Viola Davis, who is playing Tubman in an upcoming HBO biopic.In a statement released by her production company, Davis said Tubman was “an integral part of American history, and it’s time for the masses to truly understand and acknowledge the scope of who she was and what she has accomplished — that, quite bluntly, no man ever has.”Montgomery County Executive Isiah Leggett (D) sent Gov. Larry Hogan (R) a letter this month in support of a Tubman statue. Elected officials in Dorchester County, where Tubman was born, have urged legislative leaders to support the effort.Another attempt by officials in Maryland to honor Tubman fizzled in 2011.Activists, with the support of then-Gov. Martin O’Malley (D), had pushed to replace a statue in the U.S. Capitol of John Hanson — an 18th-century slave owner from southern Maryland who was a member of the Continental Congress — with one of Tubman. A bill requesting the swap did not pass.

       "21  What’s the best way to bring cutting-edge healthcare to the world’s poorest places? It can be tempting to export money and equipment to solve the problem. But when bioengineer Rebecca Richards-Kortum visits hospitals in places such as Malawi and El Salvador, she sees the unintended consequence of that charitable impulse.“Ironically, if you walk down the hall or into the basement of a hospital, there’s always a big room that is just for broken, donated equipment,” she says. The equipment works just fine in the United States, but in places plagued by lack of air conditioning, power outages, and challenges like dust and dirt, what would be a high-tech lifesaver in the U.S. is just another hunk of junk. Given the amount of time, energy, space and money that can go into figuring out how to use the equipment and repairing it when it breaks, says Richards-Kortum, “it can hurt more than it helps.”Could there be a better way? Richards-Kortum thinks so — and her efforts to bring affordable, adaptable technology to the world’s poorest places earned her a spot in this year’s class of MacArthur fellows. Richards-Kortum, who heads up Rice University’s Institute for Global Health, uses the latest advances in nanotechnology, fabrication and molecular imaging to help invent equipment that’s rugged enough to stand up to the most challenging clinical conditions and cheap enough to make sense for communities that usually lack access to health care.“Cheaper can certainly be as effective,” says Richards-Kortum. “In some cases it can be better in the sense that it improves access.” Take her high-resolution microscopic endoscope, which her team developed in conditions in countries that have high rates of cervical cancer but low access to things like labs that process pap smears or biopsies. Rather than collect tissue that is then analyzed in a laboratory, the portable endoscope lets technicians view cervical tissue, diagnosing cancer in real time and for less money. And by using new fluorescent dyes developed by Richards-Kortum and her team, doctors can spot oral cancers without spending as much money or time as they would using traditional diagnostics.Resource constraints don’t intimidate Richards-Kortum — they inspire her. “They force you to make really tough decisions,” she says. “I think you often end up with a better product.” She passes on that philosophy to students in Beyond Traditional Borders, a program she developed that teaches undergraduates how to translate classroom ideas into global health solutions. Students focus their efforts not on hypothetical situations, but on real-world problems, developing technologies that fill health needs.For example, a group of her students recently invented an inexpensive bubble CPAP machine for newborns who can’t breathe due to respiratory infections. Developed in conjunction with practitioners in Malawi, the technology decreased mortality rates in one neonatal ward by 46 percent. And patients in developing countries aren’t the only ones who benefit from the program. Students who participate in real-world projects in the program, she says, graduate at higher rates than STEM majors who don’t — especially women and underrepresented minority students.“If your inventions don’t ever leave the lab, you’re not doing your job,” she says. Similarly, she says, inventions that are designed in a vacuum are useless. Rather, she teaches her students to collaborate with end users, clinicians, and patients in the countries they seek to serve. That collaborative process can lead to even more inventive solutions, like a rapid prototyping facility Richards-Kortum helped develop at the University of Malawi. “They came up with a way to locally repair oxygen concentrators,” she says, instead of relying on a pricier, more complex fix.Though Richards-Kortum focuses the majority of her work on finding inexpensive ways to bring healthcare to the developing world, her inventions work the other way, too. She’s currently working to figure out ways to bring her cervical cancer detection system, which is currently being deployed on vans throughout rural Brazil, to under-served places in the United States, like the Rio Grande Valley in Texas.All that penny-pinching has earned Richards-Kortum an honor with a massive $625,000 stipend to use as she pleases. (“I was sure it was a telemarketer, but it turned out to not be a telemarketer,” she jokes of receiving the call from the foundation a few weeks ago.) She isn’t sure yet how she’ll use the money, but she’s committed to using it to improve health for babies and pregnant women in Malawi.“At the current rate of progress, it’s going to be 150 years before a baby who’s born in Africa has the same chance of survival as a baby in North America,” says Richard-Kortum. “I don’t want to live in that world.”Erin Blakemore (@heroinebook) is a freelance journalist from Boulder, Colo.

       "22  It’s been 13 years since the snakehead, a.k.a. the frankenfish, was first found in the Potomac River. Initial predictions were dire, but during recent years it’s become clear that the snakehead is just another fish in the river.The snakehead has not destroyed the Potomac River’s ecosystem as first predicted, and it appears that it’s coexisting with the other game fish in the river just fine. According to John Odenkirk, Virginia Department of Game & Inland Fisheries (VDGIF) biologist, the bass population in the Potomac River is better now than in recent years.I interviewed Odenkirk regarding snakeheads in the Potomac River, and his interview, lightly edited, is below:KA: Which section of the Potomac River has the densest population of snakeheads?JO: The areas further downstream (away from D.C.), in newer colonized areas (with suitable habitat), generally will have higher numbers — these will usually be found in the back of tributary arms between Occoquan and Colonial Beach within both Maryland and Virginia. Areas closer to D.C. with higher numbers in Virginia are Aquia Creek (Stafford Co.) and the Occoquan River.KA: During the past few years, has the population of snakeheads increased, decreased, or remained the same in the Potomac River? Has increased fishing pressure helped to reduce the snakehead population?JO: Snakehead abundance increased dramatically after colonization, but trends suggest that increases in abundance may have slowed. Population estimates for Little Hunting Creek (tidal tributary of the Potomac River) declined each year from 2013 to 2015, supporting the assertion that northern snakehead density increases have slowed or that density has stabilized in some creeks.In the areas where they have been longest (e.g., around Mount Vernon), numbers seem to be declining in most Virginia creeks. I am fairly certain that a high level of exploitation (both commercial and recreational), which encompasses the huge increase in bow fishing, due to this fish, has helped suppress numbers.KA: During the past few years, has the population of game fish, such as bass and walleye, increased, decreased, or remained the same in sections of the Potomac River which have snakeheads?JO: We never see walleye in the Virginia portion of the tidal Potomac. This year, the largemouth bass population looks fantastic. On balance, the bass fishery has been better in the past five or six years than longer ago (during early phase of snakehead expansion). In short, it appears both populations are functioning completely independently of one another with no competition (plenty of forage to support both at current levels).KA: Snakeheads are fun to catch and are also delicious to eat. Is there a chance they will ever get reclassified as a game fish, with trophy citations awarded?JO: Maybe someday. Probably citations before game fish status, if it happens.KA: What is the largest or heaviest snakehead documented to have been harvested in the Potomac River?JO: We don’t track those numbers officially, but it’s in the 17- to 18-pound range.KA: Do snakeheads pose more of a risk to the ecosystem of lakes, such as Burke Lake and Lake Brittle, than to the ecosystem of a large river, such as the Potomac?JO: We hope not and should have an answer in a few years, as folks have illegally stocked them in both these VDGIF-owned lakes. We have copious historical data from which to gauge community response. Both lakes are productive (fertile) systems. One concern some folks have is with illegal introductions in less productive systems.KA: When were snakeheads first found in the Potomac River?JO: The fish was first found in the Potomac River in May 2004.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",
       "23  Although we seldom think about them this way, most American communities as they exist today were built for the spry and mobile. We've constructed millions of multi-story, single-family homes where the master bedroom is on the second floor, where the lawn outside requires weekly upkeep, where the mailbox is a stroll away. We've designed neighborhoods where everyday errands require a driver's license. We've planned whole cities where, if you don't have a car, it's not particularly easy to walk anywhere — especially not if you move gingerly.This reality has been a fine one for a younger country. Those multi-story, single-family homes with broad lawns were great for Baby Boomers when they had young families. And car-dependent suburbs have been fine for residents with the means and mobility to drive everywhere. But as the Baby Boomers whose preferences drove a lot of these trends continue to age, it's becoming increasingly clear that the housing and communities we've built won't work very well for the old.A new report from Harvard's Joint Center for Housing Studies and the AARP renews this warning. What will happen to Baby Boomers stuck in suburbia once they can't drive anymore? Where will an aging population with more disabilities live when we've built so little accessible housing? How will they pay for homes late into life when there aren't enough modest-sized homes or aid programs to help afford them?For all of these reasons, we're rapidly approaching a serious clash in America between housing stock and community design on one hand, and demographics on the other.In 1990, less than 5 percent of U.S. counties had a population where adults over 50 made up more than 40 percent of the community (that was 156 counties). By 2010, this was true of 33 percent of all U.S. counties (or 1,031 of them): Harvard JCHS report \"Housing America's Older Adults\"Put another way: The U.S. population over age 65 is expected to include 73 million people by 2030 (that's about 33 million more than today). Where do most of these people currently live? In the suburbs:And in single-family homes:Most of those homes don't have the kind of basic \"universal design\" features that older residents will need, like extra-wide hallways, no-step entries, living spaces on the ground floor, or accessible light switches and door levers. The Harvard report cites 2011 American Housing Survey data concluding that just 1 percent of housing units in America have all five of these features.In theory, such adjustments will mean making homes more accessible for everyone: for dads pushing strollers, children on crutches, anyone who just wants a grandparent to visit. But the prospect of age-proofing our housing stock and neighborhoods raises some thorny policy questions: Should communities require private homeowners or commercial builders to incorporate accessibility features? (Some already do.) Are we willing to invest in transit in communities that currently don't have much of it? Can we make room for \"accessory dwelling units\" — like little backyard cottages where grandma might live — that are currently illegal in many cities?And there's another question not raised by the Harvard report, but it's an equally important one that's been voiced by researcher Arthur C. Nelson: If many Baby Boomers wind up leaving the large single-family homes they've long occupied — where they no longer want to mow the lawn or climb the stairs — will there be enough young homeowners wanting to buy them? America is the midst of shifts in both demographics and housing preferences that suggest there may not be.If you are already worried about what an aging America will mean for entitlement programs, health care spending or the labor pool, you should probably add housing to that list, too.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",
       "24  This week the Silicon Valley-based ride-sharing app Uber announced it was getting a huge new injection of funding. But the money wasn't coming from any of the standard investors from the U.S. tech world.Instead, it was coming from Saudi Arabia.The Saudi state's Public Investment Fund (PIF) was putting $3.5 billion into the company, the largest investment in Uber to date. The move has raised eyebrows, however, due to one of the kingdom's most notorious domestic policies: Saudi Arabia is the only country in the world where women cannot legally drive.While the act of driving for women is not specifically banned, various religious edicts in the country have meant women are restricted from applying for a driving license, effectively making the act of driving illegal for Saudi women. While some women in rural areas do drive without licenses anyway and some women with foreign driving licenses occasionally get behind the wheel (a legal gray area used largely in protest), for the most part women in Saudi Arabia simply don't drive. Polls suggest that support for the policy within the country is mixed.Uber, of course, does not deliberately restrict female drivers. At the end of 2015, the company said that only 19 percent of the drivers using the app were women but that it was actively trying to increase that percentage. The Saudi government will now be given a direct say in Uber's decision making process — PIF was given a seat on the board as part of the deal — but a representative of Uber said that the investment would definitely not limit women drivers on the app in the United States or other countries where women are allowed to drive.What's more complicated, however, is the role that Uber already plays in Saudi Arabia's gender politics. While the country's drivers are almost certainly entirely male, Uber's own figures show their Saudi passengers are more than 80 percent female. For many women in the country, the app and its competitors offer a chance at greater autonomy. Public transportation in Saudi Arabia is largely poor, and it can be difficult to find a regular taxi at times. Many families can't afford to hire a driver to take women places on their own.The end result is that if you are a Saudi woman and you want to commute to work or run errands on your own, a ride-sharing app can become an important tool. “There are some [women] that take five to 10 trips with us every day,” Mudassir Sheikha, the founder of local Uber rival Careem told the Los Angeles Times last year. “We don’t see that kind of traffic anywhere.”Uber has acknowledged the role its app plays in the country, usually portraying it as a strength. In December the company offered free Uber rides to Saudi women during the first election in which they were legally allowed to vote.“Of course we think women should be allowed to drive,” Jill Hazelbaker, an Uber spokeswoman, told the New York Times this week. “In the absence of that, we have been able to provide extraordinary mobility that didn’t exist before — and we’re incredibly proud of that.” It's expected now that the Saudi investment in Uber should end lingering questions about the legality of the service in the country.Yet the company could also be accused of providing a reprieve for the Saudi government from dealing with the issues surrounding female drivers in the country. Members of the Saudi royal family have repeatedly suggested that they believe women should be able to drive — Saudi Arabia’s Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, a powerful voice in the country, recently suggested that \"women don’t get their complete rights granted them by Islam.”Yet no real moves toward lifting the restrictions on female drivers have been seen recently. Crown Prince Mohammed said in April that the country was still \"not convinced about women driving.\"The problem is likely opposition from the Saudi kingdom's powerful religious community, which largely opposes female drivers. While one cleric infamously suggested that driving could damage women's ovaries, many focus on more practical reasons: What happens if a female driver is pulled over by a male cop? Saudi Arabia's religious customs would find this type of interaction between male and female strangers inappropriate (the interaction between Saudi women and male Uber drivers raises fewer eyebrows because it is transactional in nature). Saudi Arabia has announced its intentions to hire more female police officers, but progress remains slow.Meanwhile, public transport projects are also making slim progress. Riyadh's planned metro station is not slated to open until 2018. And while Uber is an option for some women, for many it's still too expensive for any kind of regular use. Some observers wonder if the eventual end of Saudi Arabia's restrictions on female drivers will come from self-driving cars rather than anything else.The Saudi government gets more complicated still when you consider the broader economic factors at play. Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed has become the figurehead of a widely publicized push (dubbed Saudi Vision 2030) to modernize the Saudi economy and end its \"addiction\" to oil. The hope is to diversify the country's business world, using the country's vast wealth it has accumulated over the years to invest in profitable ventures and focusing on underdeveloped industries like tourism and arms.There's a social component at work here, too, most notably in the significant cuts being made to the subsidies given to Saudi citizens. Female citizens are being encouraged to enter the workforce, with Mohammed stating the aim was to increase their participation from 22 percent to 30 percent by 2030. Such moves may soon put the ruling Saudi royals at odds with the country's religious elite, potentially shattering a partnership that has provided relative stability to the country for decades.The investment in Uber seems to be a sign that the Saudi state is willing to bet big on the country's economic future. How those economic bets will translate socially is hard to predict.More on WorldViewsSaudi Arabia announces plan to end its ‘addiction’ to oilThe facts — and a few myths — about Saudi Arabia and human rightsSaudi Arabia’s ‘Islamic military alliance’ against terrorism makes no senseUpdate: This post has been amended to include comment from an Uber representative who said the Saudi investment would not restrict women drivers on the app in the United States or other countries where women can legally drive.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",
       "25  UPDATE 4:30 p.m.: Twitter user @MetricMaps kindly made and allowed us to post the following animated map from the Census data.The share of households on food stamps has more than doubled since 2000, a new Census Bureau report finds.From 2000 to 2013, the share of households receiving aid through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program has grown from 6.2 percent to 13.5 percent nationally. What was once a program providing aid to 1 in 16 Americans is now helping 1 in 8.[How a diet fueled by food stamps is making South Texans obese but leaving them hungry]To be counted, only one individual per household has to be receiving SNAP benefits over the year prior to being surveyed. Here’s a look at what the report’s data show:Yesterday’s high is close to today’s lowIn the year 2000, 10.9 percent of West Virginian households received food stamps—more than any other state. Today, 37 states boast rates above that level.Four states—Wisconsin, Nevada, Michigan and Massachusetts—saw SNAP reliance more than triple by 2013. Another 26 saw rates more than double.Michigan and Oregon posted the largest percentage point increases, with rates up 11.7 points in each. Wyoming has seen food stamp use rise the least, with a mere 0.5 percentage point rise, the only one lacking statistical significance. The rate in Washington, D.C. rose from 8.8 percent in 2000 to 15.7 percent, a 6.9 point rise.In some states, food stamp reliance is approaching 1 in 5Today, the share of households on food stamps is as high as 19.8 percent in Oregon and 19.4 percent in Mississippi and as little as 5.9 percent in Wyoming.Southern states are home to some of the highest rates of food stamp reliance, as the Census Bureau notes. States in the Midwest and West have some of the lowest rates.In 2000, rates were as low as 1 in 25 in several statesNearly half the states in 2000 had SNAP rates below today’s minimum 5.9 percent, with Colorado boasting the lowest rate of 3.3 percent back then.Another 14 states had rates below 5 percent.

       "26  AMAZONAS, Brazil – At the base of a towering, 150-foot-high angelim tree, the scattered sloth claws and clumps of fur are a dead giveaway.The tree contains the nest of a harpy eagle, a bird so powerful it kills monkeys and sloths by tearing them from the trees with its enormous claws. Its presence is a good sign to the scientists who are studying the surrounding forest.It means this section of trees and its vast network of life are still healthy enough to support such a high-order predator. And that, in turn, is at least a small bit of good news for the Earth’s climate.Of all the components of the recent Paris accord on climate change, the one that probably got the least attention but could have the most immediate potential involves the world’s forests. In a section some hailed as historic, the document endorsed a United Nations mechanism for wealthier nations to pay developing countries like Brazil for reducing deforestation.Trees are good at keeping carbon out of the air, and simply preserving the planet’s vast forests is a straightforward way to get a huge head start on the business of slowing climate change. But that effort grows tougher every day. After years of progress, deforestation rates have increased recently in Brazil, and deforestation continues apace across much of the global tropics. The economic forces of agriculture and trade remain too strong to resist.Calls for saving rainforests have a long history, but including forests as a core part of the global climate solution is “very very recent,” said Naoko Ishii, CEO of the Global Environment Facility, an international body that invests in restoring tropical forests. “Without taking care of the forests, it’s going to be just impossible to achieve the Paris agreement.”In fact, recent estimates suggest as much as a third of climate emissions could be offset by stopping deforestation and restoring forest land — and that this solution could be achieved much faster than cuts to fossil fuels.Forests are a crucial “carbon sink,” living engines for absorbing and storing carbon. Tropical forests store the most carbon of all, and no tropical forest on Earth is bigger than the Amazon. It accounts for about half of all the carbon these forests store. But the Brazilian Amazon has lost nearly a fifth of its forest cover already — and the forest left behind also suffers because it is more fragmented and less continuous.Thomas Lovejoy, a George Mason University ecologist, has been studying this section of Amazon for decades. While he was encouraged to see the harpy eagle at its nest on a recent afternoon, he was conscious of the forest’s overall fragility.The Amazon system as a whole, Lovejoy said, is at a “precarious point. And you know, the obvious thing is, you don’t want to find out where the tipping point is by tipping it.”Of trees and warming The forest is protected in this roughly 4-square-mile federal research and conservation plot to the northeast of the city of Manaus, where the dark and acidic Rio Negro meets the more brownish Solimões to form the lower Amazon river, the largest in the world.But not far from here, the smell of smoke still hangs over a recently deforested plot – trees slashed down and then burned. So it has gone throughout the Amazon, and far worse in more southern Brazilian states, such as Pará and Mato Grosso.All of which makes the relentless focus on fossil fuels in the climate discussion – and the consigning of forests, at least until now, to a relative side role – somewhat puzzling. Forests, after all, are almost half carbon (if you leave out the water, that is). The billion year old process of photosynthesis stores carbon in the sugars that, in turn, fuel plant growth and metabolism.The storage of carbon is most intense in tropical forests, where a gigantic abundance of different types of trees, thick vines and epiphytes (plants that grow on other plants) are all fighting one another for a slice of direct tropical sunlight – only a sliver of which actually reaches the forest floor. Trees don’t put down very deep roots here; they stretch them outward across the ground, over a layer of often sandy soil that isn’t even very rich or fertile. If the land is cleared, not only is all the carbon lost to the atmosphere, but the result often isn’t even very good farmland or pasture.Net greenhouse gas emissions due to tropical deforestation and forest degradation are about 8 to 15 percent of the global total, which doesn’t sound like that much. But a recent study in Nature Climate Change found that stopping deforestation could nonetheless be a huge piece of the climate solution. That’s because if tropical deforestation stopped, not only would those emissions go away, but on top of that, forests would start stowing away a significant part of the carbon from our fossil fuel emissions.“One could reduce total CO2 emissions by about 30 percent, just working in the land sector,” said Phil Duffy, president of the Woods Hole Research Center. “And that’s a lot.”Moreover, stopping deforestation could buy precious time to ratchet down fossil fuel emissions. “It’s very hard to suddenly convert everyone to electric cars, and power generation is gradually changing, but it’s going to take decades,” said Paul Salaman, CEO of the Rainforest Trust. “But tropical deforestation can literally be stopped point blank with commitment of countries.”Why a fragmented forest stores less carbon What science is revealing, meanwhile, is that it’s not just deforestation itself that’s the problem – it’s also the damage to what’s left behind.Camp 41, which is run collaboratively by Brazil’s National Institute for Amazonian Research and the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute, is a scientific “control” – an example of what happens when you just leave the rainforest alone and let it grow. By contrast, near here are several forest fragments, which Lovejoy helped preserve for research in the late 1970s after the surrounding land was set to be cleared for ranching.The study of these fragments, which has been ongoing since 1980, shows that the forest left behind in the wake of deforestation also suffers greatly.“This project I think more than any other demonstrated that forest fragmentation in patches was a very, very big problem for nature,” said Harvey Locke, a conservationist and writer who visited Camp 41 with Lovejoy in December. “You never hear anybody seriously arguing now that several little patches are better than a big intact block.”Walking through an isolated, nearly 25-acre forest fragment presents a stunning contrast with the forest near the harpy eagle’s angelim tree. In the intact forest, it’s dark and even relatively cool at the forest floor, a simple function of the fact that trees and vines, crowding upward, have managed to claim nearly all of the sunlight.But in the fragment, direct tropical sunlight penetrates much farther, not only from above but from every side. It’s warmer as a result, and also drier – the layer of fallen leaves on the forest floor isn’t wet and spongy, but crunches and crackles as you walk.This environment sustains less life – animals and plants alike. Spider monkeys, which need to range over a huge area, can’t survive in a fragment like this, Lovejoy said. And they’re one food source for the harpy eagle.“Wherever the forest has been altered or compromised, where hunting has reduced prey items, harpys are one of the first to suffer,” said Bret Whitney, a specialist in Brazilian birds and a research associate at Louisiana State University who guided the recent trip to Camp 41 and identified the harpy eagle. “They really require an intact ecosystem to be out there.”“We know that tree mortality went up in this fragment compared to continuous forest,” Lovejoy said. The forest, when fragmented, “becomes simpler,” he said. Winds also blow down more trees in fragments, Lovejoy’s research suggests, another reason that they store less carbon.The punchline, then, isn’t far from that    \n",
       "27  After a series of explosions rocked the airport and a metro station in Brussels on Tuesday, killing at least 30 and wounding scores of others, city and transit agencies across the U.S. beefed up patrols, taking similar measures to those in the wake of the Paris terror attacks last fall.In New York, counterterrorism resources were deployed to transit hotspots across the city. The New York Police Department said teams were sent to crowded areas and transit stops “out of an abundance of caution.”“At this time, there is no known indication that the attack has any nexus to New York City. We will continue to follow the situation in Belgium closely with the Joint Terrorism Task Force and the FBI and adjust the department’s deployments accordingly,” police spokesman Stephen P. Davis said in a statement.The United States Department of Homeland Security did not heighten its federal threat level, but advised the public to report suspicious activity. Homeland Security Secretary Jeh C. Johnson said in a statement that “additional security” would be deployed at major city airports and rail and transit stations across the country.New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) directed state officials to step up patrols at heavily traveled locations around the state, including bridges, tunnels, airports and mass transit systems, he said.“Public safety is paramount, and I want the people of this state to know that we are working with all local and federal partners, remaining vigilant and taking all necessary measures to keep New Yorkers safe,” he said in a statement.At JFK International Airport, New York National Guard forces were providing additional security detail. The Guard deployed 400 service members across the New York City area Tuesday, Cuomo said. They focused increased patrols on transportation hubs such as JFK and LaGuardia Airports. In addition, New York State Troopers were monitoring Penn Station and Grand Central Station as well as the Queens-Midtown Tunnel and George Washington Bridge. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey stepped up its police presence at airports, bridges, tunnels and the World Trade Center complex, Cuomo said. And the Metropolitan Transit Auhtority was upping patrols across the system.In Washington, Metro Transit Police advised passengers to remain vigilant. The agency said it would conduct additional K9 sweeps and patrols across the system Tuesday morning as a precaution, but that no “known, specific or credible threat” existed. Alexandria Deputy Police Chief Shahram Fard said in a Tweet that Alexandria Police patrol officers were assisting Metro Transit Police in monitoring Metro parking lots, and it was expected that agencies across the region would aid in the security effort.Internationally, the attacks led to the cancellation of hundreds of flights — mostly in and out of Brussels Airport — which closed Tuesday. Brussels Airlines had cancelled 203 flights by Tuesday afternoon, according to the Flight tracking website flightaware.com.On U.S. airlines, the site said, flights with Brussels on their itinerary were canceled. They included: A United Airlines flight bound for Dulles International Airport that was scheduled to leave Brussels at 7:10 a.m. Eastern Time on Tuesday, along with three other United flights; six Delta Airlines flights and two American Airlines flights — one bound for Philadelphia and another departing from there for the Belgian capital.American Airlines spokesman Kent Powell said the airline has made accommodations for passengers with reservations to Brussels, and arrangements would be made for those who remain in Belgium. Flights to and from Brussels were canceled through Thursday, he said. American’s next flight to Brussels is scheduled to depart Philadelphia on Friday evening, while its next flight from Brussels back to the U.S. is scheduled to leave the Belgian capital at 9:40 Saturday morning.“American Airlines is taking care of our employees and customers in Brussels after this morning’s events. At this time, there are no reported injuries to our employees. American Airlines check-in operates at Row 8 of the departure hall, and the explosions did not occur at Row 8,” Powell said. “American Airlines flight 751 from Brussels to Philadelphia has been canceled for today. When operations at the Brussels airport resume, we will reaccommodate our customers. We have issued a travel policy for customers with reservations to Brussels who wish to change their itineraries.”The Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority did not outline specific steps that were being taken at the region’s two major airports, Dulles International and Reagan National airports, but a statement reinforced the airports’ commitment to passenger safety. The statement encouraged passengers to stay vigilant and report any unusual activity.“Reagan National and Dulles International airports have a robust security structure, both publicly visible and behind the scenes,” the statement read. “We constantly train our employees and evaluate our security procedures, in collaboration with our federal partners and local mutual aid partners, to make adjustments, updates and enhancements based on new information and situations.”Officials at Baltimore Washington International Airport said they were “working closely” with federal and state law enforcement agencies after the Brussels attacks, but that no specific threat existed.Maryland officials said Tuesday that travelers should expect to see more police and canine explosive detection patrols throughout the state’s transportation network.“In the wake of the horrific attacks today in Belgium, we are taking every precaution to keep Maryland citizens safe and secure,” Gov. Larry Hogan (R) said in a statement. “In particular, there will be a more visible law enforcement presence at the airport, train stations and other mass transit locations around the state. I encourage all Marylanders, especially those traveling, to remain vigilant and aware of their surroundings at all times. If you see something unusual or unsettling, please report it immediately.”Transportation Secretary Pete K. Rahn said two pre-established law enforcement plans for the MTA Police and the Maryland Transportation Authority Police would be implemented.“In addition to the increased enforcement you do see, there are many measures in place that travelers won’t see,” Rahn said. “Please be aware of your surroundings and remember: ‘If you see something, say something.’ ”In Chicago, extra officers and canine units were dispatched to the airports and Chicago Transit Authority stations stations as a precaution, the Chicago Tribune reported. A police spokesman told the paper that the interim police superintendent has ordered “stepped-up presence at airports and transportation sites within Chicago.”In Los Angeles, the county sheriff’s transit police swept Union Station, the downtown train station, and heightened security at other transit hubs, according to the Los Angeles Times. Security would be increased at several of the city’s major metro stations, a spokesman told the paper.At Los Angeles International Airport, officers would be making their presence known more than usual, an airport police officer told the paper.And in San Francisco, there would be an increased uniform police presence at “key locations” across the Bay Area Rapid Transit system, said spokeswoman Alicia Trost. The system was also sending out a “See Something, Say Something” memo to passengers through its safety and security app BART Watch.Lori Aratani and Ashley Halsey III contributed to this post.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",
       "28  It's a big year for women in politics.In a historic first, Hillary Clinton was named the Democratic Party’s presidential nominee in the upcoming U.S. elections. If she wins, she will join Theresa May of Britain and Angela Merkel of Germany in the ranks of women who lead prominent Western democracies.They're not alone, either. In recent years, the number of women holding positions in both parliament and executive government has grown. As of June 2016, women’s membership in parliament doubled from 11.3 percent in 1995 to 22.1 percent in 2015, according to a recent study by the Inter-Parliamentary Union.And this year alone, there have been many historic firsts.In Iran, women won 17 seats during the Islamic Republic’s parliamentary elections in February. “This is a record and we are happy that our dear women are taking part in all stages, especially in politics,” Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said in a speech back in May.Africa has had some of the most dramatic breakthroughs over the past 20 years. As of June, four African nations were part of the top 10 as far as the number of women represented in parliament. Rwanda, for example, tops the chart as the country with the highest number of women represented in parliament in both the lower (63.8 percent) and upper houses (38.5 percent) in 2016.But women remain a relatively small group in parliaments around the world, and progress is slow. Data from the IPU shows that in a vast majority of countries, men still dominate the political stage. In both the lower and upper houses combined, women around the world account for around 22 percent of seats held in parliament.\"Yes it is an improvement considering that it started at a low base,\" Executive Director of U.N. Women Phumzile Mlambo Ngcuka said. \"But if we continue at this pace, it's going to take us too long. We need to fast-track the attainment of gender equality.\"The U.S. is one country that lags the global average of women in the national legislature. It ranks behind 95 countries, including low- and middle-income countries such as Ethiopia, El Salvador and Suriname. Other countries that outperform the United States include Iraq, Afghanistan and Saudi Arabia.One way that countries have been fast-tracking female participation in politics is through gender quotas, and the results have left many surprised. Countries that that have relatively low socioeconomic development or have just emerged from conflict, such as Afghanistan, Tanzania and Ecuador, have shown tremendous improvement and have higher levels of female representation in parliaments.Jennifer Rosen, assistant professor of sociology at Pepperdine University, says emerging democracies give leaders a unique opportunity for leaders to enshrine gender quotas in their new constitutions, helping bypass cultural barriers that would have otherwise stood in the way of women participating in politics for many years.Different electoral systems also influence women's participation in parliament. While scholars agree that proportional representation systems, which allow people to vote for a party list rather than a particular candidate, have a positive influence on female representation in government, some are divided as to whether it has a positive impact on all countries or only on Western democracies.One way for countries to shift their mentalities is to encourage people in executive leadership positions to set an example, Rosen said. Ngcuka, the U.N. women executive director, agrees and said men play an important role and that women shouldn't be the only ones trying to \"move the glass ceiling,\" noting how attitudes change when influential leaders such as Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau nominated a cabinet in 2015 that was half-female.Political parties that are supposed to provide gender quotas need to ensure that they place women in winnable positions, IPU Secretary General Martin Chungong said. \"In many instances they are not walking the walk,\" he said. \"It's not enough to have quotas. We need to provide incentives for people who don't want to implement them.\"What's also clear is that having women in national legislatures can change the way a country is governed. Research shows that when women participate in politics, the conversation gets steered toward issues that their male counterparts often fail to address, such as family planning, education and gender-based violence.\"We have seen that there are certain issues women are better able to articulate,\" Chungong said. \"Women tend to take leading roles not because it is a women's issue, but because it has to do with livelihood of society as a whole.\" More on WorldViewsThe world is getting better at paid maternity leave.

       "29  We’ve all heard the complaint or something like it: “I’ve been staring at the screen all day. My eyes hurt.” But is it really the screen’s fault? (And if so, is there any long- or short-term damage?) Would our eyes be any better off perusing printed pages all day?Yes, you can blame the screen, but not for everything. Some of the same eye-care advice you’ll hear for computer screens apply to paper-bookworms, too.Screen-induced eye strain has an official name, if not a surprising one: computer vision syndrome. The term emerged about 20 years ago and describes a host of bothersome symptoms, including eye fatigue, burning and itchy eyes, blurred vision and sensitivity to bright light. People who spend two or more continuous hours at a computer every day are at greatest risk for developing the syndrome, according to the American Optometric Association.For most people, symptom treatment is enough — managing their reading position, taking rest breaks or using eye drops to relieve dry eyes. That said, dry and irritated eyes are associated with disorders of the cornea, the transparent layer at the front of the eye. See a doctor if you’re putting drops in your eyes five or six times a day and still feel like they’re dry, says James Salz, a University of Southern California eye doctor and spokesperson for the American Academy of Ophthalmology. Still, he adds, “there’s no evidence that there’s any long-term damage from reading on a screen.”What is it about computers that irritates our eyes? The problem boils down to a couple of key factors:Blinking. Study after study has found that when reading on screens people tend to stare more than they do when reading on a printed page. More staring means less blinking, which means your eyes get less refreshment from tears. “When you blink, you spread a layer of tears over the eye,” says Mark Rosenfield, a professor at the State University of New York College of Optometry. With less blinking, eyes get dry and sore.Another difference between the printed page and the computer screen is where the words are positioned relative to the eyes. People generally look down while reading a book or newspaper, but staring at screen usually means staring straight ahead. When you look down, more of your eye is covered by the eyelid, but when you look straight ahead more of your eye is exposed to the drying effect of air. Coupled with reduced blinking, this leads to dry eyes. Reading on mobile devices may be more book-like in terms of positioning, but blink rate is still a concern.A small 2013 study found that when reading print on paper or e-ink (the technology that attempts to replicate as closely as possible the printed page experience, Kindle paperwhite in this study), the subjects — 12 men who read for at least an hour on each device — blinked more often when reading on paper or e-ink than they did when looking at an LCD screen (a tablet with its own light supply, the Kindle Fire here). Participants also reported more visual fatigue after reading on the LCD; fatigue rates on e-ink and paper were equivalent. Distance. Not surprisingly, people reading on their smartphones tend to hold the device much closer to their eyes than they would a book or magazine. In a 2011 study, Rosenfield found that the 219 participants held their phones 14 inches from their eyes to read text messages and 12?1 / 2 inches for a Web page. Typically, people read printed text from a distance of 15?3 / 4 inches.The result is that “your eye has to work much harder to focus at close distances,” Rosenfield says. The eyes turn in more (not quite cross-eyed) and that takes effort. Over time, that can lead to fatigue.Moreover, if you’re of a certain age, that focusing effort becomes even harder. At about age 40, natural changes in the eye’s focal length means most people can’t see closely as well. That’s when you start holding the restaurant menu at an arm’s length to read.Other considerations are resolution, brightness, and glare, says Alan Hedge, a professor of ergonomics at Cornell University. “The resolution of print on paper is higher than any screen out there.” Brightness should be adjusted for comfort, either on your screen or the lamp by your reading chair. As for glare, it is easier to read a book or an e-ink on an e-reader in the sunshine. But if you’re reading late at night in bed, you might prefer the backlit screen of a tablet.The good thing about electronic reading is that you can change so many things to make the experience more comfortable, such as increasing the size of the text and fiddling with the brightness, which can also help you keep the words at a distance. Salz says 18 inches is ideal.Common sense goes a long way too, Salz says. “As soon as you feel fatigue, look away.”Indeed, workplace advice for people who read on computers for a large part of their days, comes in the 20-20-20 rule: Every 20 minutes, look 20 feet away for 20 seconds.So good for us: A new excuse to gaze out the window.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",
       "30  Super Typhoon Vongfong has rapidly intensified over the past 24 hours, from the equivalent of a category two hurricane to a monster typhoon with 155 mph wind speeds, and an estimated central pressure of 908 millibars.Based on satellite estimates of central pressure, Vongfong is now the most intense storm on Earth so far in 2014, and forecast models suggest it could rival the intensity of deadly Typhoon Haiyan of 2013 over the next 24 hours.During the 24 hours between Monday and Tuesday mornings, Vongfong ballooned from wind speeds of 89 mph to 168 mph, based on satellite estimates. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center estimates that Typhoon Vongfong has maximum winds of 155 mph on Tuesday morning, though this is likely a conservative estimate.Vongfong is now the sixth super typhoon of 2014, with winds speeds over 150 mph.The Joint Typhoon Warning Center points to a favorable environment for the cause of the rapid intensification, including low wind shear and excellent outflow, which helps to ventilate and strengthen the storm.Forecast models are suggesting that the super typhoon could continue to intensify, tanking to 895 millibars — a typhoon intensity not seen since Typhoon Haiyan in 2013, which killed over 6,000 people. A pressure that low would beat this year’s second most intense storm — Typhoon Genevieve — by 20 millibars.Luckily, this monster storm is not expected to make landfall while it’s at such high intensity. Over the next 24 to 48 hours, Vongfong is forecast to make a sharp turn north toward Japan. By Saturday morning, the typhoon is forecast to weaken to the equivalent of a category three, and then a category two with wind speeds of 105 mph, as it approaches the southern islands of the Kagoshima Prefecture of Japan.Beyond this, global forecast models are suggesting Vongfong will continue to turn northeast and potentially making landfall in the southern Japan mainland, which will undoubtedly bring torrential rain to a region already soaked from Typhoon Phanfone.

       "31  This story and its headline have been been updated, with \"alarming\" being changed to \"striking.\" See below for more details.Critics of the fast-food industry have long warned about the perils of our addiction to processed food. Big Macs and Whoppers might taste good, but put too many of them in your body and it will expand as Violet Beauregard's did in Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory (although maybe not quite as fast). The evidence is decades in the making. The rise of processed food, after all, has coincided with an alarming growth in the size of our collective gut.But there might be some new powerful ammunition for those who could do without the food the fast-food industry serves.Researchers at George Washington University have linked fast-food consumption to the presence of potentially harmful chemicals, a connection they argue could have \"great public health significance.\" Specifically, the team found that people who eat fast food tend to have significantly higher levels of certain phthalates, which are commonly used in consumer products such as soap and makeup to make them less brittle but have been linked to a number of adverse health outcomes, including higher rates of infertility, especially among males.The danger, the researchers believe, isn't necessarily a result of the food itself, but rather the process by which the food is prepared. The findings were published in Environmental Health Perspectives, a journal funded by the National Institutes of Health.\"We're not trying to create paranoia or anxiety, but I do think our findings are alarming,\" said one of the study's authors, Ami Zota, an assistant professor of environmental and occupational health at George Washington University. \"It's not every day that you conduct a study where the results are this strong.\"(Update: A few hours after publication, Zota called to say that in reading her quote she felt that the word \"alarming\" was too strong a word to use to describe her findings. Rather, she said \"striking\" was more appropriate, because it conveys the magnitude of the findings without assigning a sense of urgency.)Fast-food nationIn order to gauge how fast food affects the presence of certain non-natural chemicals, the team analyzed data for nearly 9,000 people. The data was collected as part of federal nutrition surveys conducted between 2003 and 2010. The surveys included detailed information about the participants' diets, including what each had eaten in the last 24 hours. They also contained the results of urine samples taken at the same time, which allowed the researchers to measure the levels of three separate chemicals.For the purpose of the study, any food eaten at or from restaurants without waiters or waitresses was considered fast food. Everything else — food eaten at sit-down restaurants and bars or purchased from supermarkets and vending machines — was not.The first thing the researchers found was that roughly one-third of the participants said they had eaten some form of fast food over the course of the day leading up to the urine sample collection. That proportion, high as it might seem, is actually in line with government estimates. In fact, more than a third of all children and adolescents living in the country still eat some form of fast food on any given day, a number that hasn't budged in decades, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.The second thing the researchers found is that those participants who said they had eaten fast food in the last 24 hours tended to have much higher levels of two separate phthalates — DEHP and DiNP. People who reported eating only a little fast food had DEHP levels that were 15.5 percent higher and DiNP levels that were 25 percent higher than those who said they had eaten none. For people who reported eating a sizable amount, the increase was 24 percent and 39 percent, respectively.And the connection held true even after the researchers adjusted for various factors about the participants' habits and backgrounds that might have contributed to the association between fast-food consumption and phthalate levels.\"We looked at it in so many different ways, and the effect still remains,\" said Zota.The problem with these chemicalsThere is little consensus on the harms of phthalates, which are widely used in commerce and give materials such as food packaging added flexibility, except that exposure to them \"is widespread.\" But there is growing concern that the chemicals could pose a variety of risks, particularly when observed in the sort of levels seen in the study.\"There's a vast amount of scientific evidence suggesting certain phthalates can contribute to several adverse health effects,\" said Zota.A 2012 study found a strong association between the presence of DEHP and diabetes. A 2013 study found that exposure to the industrial chemical can increase the risk of various allergic diseases in children. And a 2016 study concluded that it can also negatively affect child behavior.While there is less evidence that DiNP is problematic, some recent research suggests it very well could be. A study undertaken last year, for instance, found that exposure to the phthalate was associated with higher blood pressure.For these reasons, many governments have moved to limit exposure to the industrial chemicals. Japan disallowed the use of vinyl gloves in food preparation for fear that their use was compromising health. The European Union, which limits the use of the chemical, has been nudging manufacturers to replace it. And the United States restricted its use in toys. In fact, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services warned that DEHP is \"reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen.\"To fear or not to fearThe reason people who eat fast food seem to have much higher levels of potentially harmful industrial chemicals is unclear. But it's easy enough to guess: the sheer amount of processing that goes into food served at quick-service restaurants.The more machinery, plastic, conveyor belts, and various forms of processing equipment that food touches, the more likely the food is to contain higher levels of phthalates. And fast food tends to touch a good deal more of these things than, say, the food one purchases at a local farmers market.\"I really hope this study helps raise public awareness about the exposure problems associated with our industrialized food system,\" said Zota.Considering the prevalence of packaged food — and widespread exposure to phthalates (they can be detected in more than 98 percent of the population, per the CDC) — however, the takeaway isn't necessarily that fast food is toxic. Fast food, after all, isn't the only culprit here. Nor are less healthful things in general.\"It’s not fair to say, 'Oh, these exposures only happen if you eat unhealthy foods,'\" Leo Trasande, an associate professor of pediatrics, environmental medicine and population health at New York University, told Bloomberg.Anything that's gone through some form of processing or industrial packaging is vulnerable.Still, given the new study's findings, it certainly seems as though eating fast food is more toxic than avoiding it, and not for the obvious reasons. Perhaps that's something many would have expected to hear, but it doesn't make it any less true.\"Traditional fast food was never meant to be daily fare, and it shouldn’t be,\" said Marion Nestle, who is the Paulette Goddard professor of nutrition and food Studies at New York University. \"It’s too high in calories and salt and, as we now know, the chemicals that get into our food supply through industrial food production.\"Like our Health & Wellness page on Facebook for more science news about the ins and outs of the human body and mind, essays and advice.

       "32  Correction: An earlier version of this story included Goldman Sachs among companies that industry sources say have traded “renewable identification number” certificates, or RINs. A Goldman spokesman says the firm has not traded RINs for itself or on behalf of clients. This version has been corrected.The “now hiring” sign is up online for Emmetsburg, Iowa, where the nation’s largest maker of ethanol used for motor fuel is putting the final touches on a manufacturing plant that will rely not on corn, but on the stalks and cobs left behind.The company, Poet, is looking for an accountant, electricians, lab technicians, a supervisor for starch and cellulose operations, and more. Large flatbed trucks have already dropped off 2,600 tons of big bales at the distillery’s 22-acre stack yard. Equipment is visible from miles away across the flat, open prairie. The process is a bit like making moonshine on an industrial scale, helped along by some high-tech, bioengineered enzymes.“My gosh, it’s been a boon for everybody,” said Myrna Heddinger, a retired nurse serving her third term as the mayor of Emmetsburg, a town of 3,500 people that has squeezed in 500 temporary construction workers. “We just don’t have that many places for people to rent to stay,” she added.Poet and its joint venture partner, the Dutch industrial giant and enzyme maker DSM, have received $100 million in Energy Department grants and $20 million in financial incentives from the state of Iowa. They say they expect to begin production of ethanol at the Emmetsburg plant in early 2014, at a rate of about 20 million gallons a year.Not a moment too soon. For months, a brawl has been brewing in Washington over the future of ethanol plants like this one, pitting well-financed oil giants against trade groups and companies representing the politically well-connected biofuel industry.The heart of the dispute is the Energy Independence and Security Act passed by Congress in 2007 with rare bipartisan support. The law provided a road map for increasing the use of renewable agricultural byproducts in the U.S. motor fuel supply. The Poet plant is just what Congress envisioned, a Middle America biofuel displacing Middle East crude — with some possible climate benefits to boot.Corn-based ethanol, which makes up nearly 10 percent of U.S. motor fuel, has been in large-scale production for years. But Congress was worried about driving up the price of corn used as feed for livestock and poultry. So lawmakers capped the total production of corn-based ethanol and set a schedule for ramping up the use of “advanced” biofuels made from corn husks, switch grass, wood chips and other stuff known as “cellulosic” material to 16 billion gallons by 2022.There’s one problem, though: So far, no company has produced cellulosic ethanol at commercial volumes.A slower-than-expected startCongress assumed that it could be phased in gradually, but not this gradually. This year refiners were supposed to mix about one billion gallons of it into motor fuel. So far, there has been hardly a drop. More than a dozen companies have tried and failed to find a profitable formula combining sophisticated enzymes and the mundane but costly and labor-intensive job of collecting biomass.Congress had the foresight to provide a safety valve. The Environmental Protection Agency, using its authority under the 2007 law, slashed the cellulosic ethanol quota this year, first to a paltry 14 million gallons and then again to 6 million, equal to about 0.004 percent of the fuel consumed by U.S. automobiles. It also extended the deadline for compliance. The EPA is widely expected to announce minimal quotas for next year soon, too. Oil industry lobbyists believe the EPA will also, for the first time, trim the minimum quotas for corn-based ethanol, angering farm interests and big corn-ethanol producers.The shortfall in cellulosic ethanol output has helped trigger high costs for some oil refiners under an arcane enforcement scheme that has the oil industry screaming — and lobbying — for congressional and regulatory relief. Ashley M. Smith, vice president for investor relations for Valero, the nation’s biggest oil refiner, said during an Oct. 29 conference call with analysts that the company expects to spend $500 million to $600 million this year to buy certificates to comply with the program.The American Petroleum Institute, a trade group for the nation’s oil and gas industry, says that petroleum refiners shouldn’t have to wait for the EPA to amend the targets every year. It wants the mandates — known as the Renewable Fuel Standard — abolished so that refiners don’t pay penalties for failing to comply. The API has wallpapered billboards, Web sites and subway systems with ads. It has lobbied key members of Congress. And it has filed a lawsuit against what it called an “unrealistic mandate.”“Our bottom line is that the RFS must be stopped once and for all,” said Bob Greco, API’s director of upstream and industry operations. He said the standard was “simply broken.”William R. Klesse, chief executive of Valero, which is also the nation’s third-largest cornethanol producer, wrote to EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy in September saying that cellulosic ethanol “is still basically nonexistent with only small volumes expected.” He said Congress “should develop an alternate RFS that encourages the development of the business, but also represents the real world.”The ethanol industry has fired back that the oil companies’s real agenda is to prevent a new industry from competing for space in American fuel tanks. They charge that oil firms fear losing even a 1 percent share of the roughly $450 billion-a-year gasoline market, especially since U.S. gasoline consumption peaked in 2005 and has been falling as a result of higher fuel-efficiency standards for new American cars.“We would never have invested the amount of money we’ve done without a clear framework like the one the RFS is providing. It is absolutely critical,” said Manuel Sánchez Ortega, the chief executive of Spanish engineering giant Abengoa, which is finishing a cellulosic ethanol plant in Hugoton, Kan. Repealing the RFS, he added, “would be somehow misleading to the investment community.”Rep. John Shimkus (R-Ill.), a senior member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, is one target of lobbying groups. The goals set by Congress in 2007 were “just too aggressive,” he said during a September meeting with reporters organized by Platts, an energy newsletter. But, he added, “there are people who’ve made major investments. You’re talking billions of dollars. .?.?. So what kind of signal are you sending” by changing the RFS? “That kind of scares me,” he said.The industry takes offThe fight is coming to a head just as the first well-financed, truly commercial-size cellulosic ethanol plants are poised to come onstream. These ventures, while behind schedule, aren’t start-ups, and the companies behind them have the financial muscle to push ahead. Dupont is close to completing a plant in the town of Nevada, Iowa, that will produce 30 million gallons a year. Abengoa, the Spanish multinational energy, engineering and construction firm with more than 22,000 employees worldwide, says its Kansas plant will start up by early next year and produce 25 million gallons a year. It has been signing 10-year contracts with farmers within a 50-mile radius to buy biomass.Poet and DSM expect to begin production in Emmetsburg in early 2014 at a rate of about 20 million gallons a year. Poet, which is the country’s biggest corn-based ethanol producer, has worked on cellulosic technology since 2001. The plant is located next to a Poet corn-ethanol plant, so that it can draw on the same farmers for raw material.“You’ve got $1 billion plus of investment in steel, and people don’t put that kind of money in just for fun,” said Adam Monroe, president of Novozymes America, the subsidiary of a Danish company that makes enzymes used to convert plant   \n",
       "33  It was a driver’s worst nightmare.Andy Greenberg was speeding along a busy interstate in St. Louis recently when he suddenly lost control of his vehicle. The accelerator abruptly stopped working. The car crawled to a stop. As 18-wheelers whizzed by his stalled vehicle, Greenberg began to panic.His car hadn’t spun out on black ice, however. It hadn’t been hit by another vehicle or experienced engine trouble.It had been hacked.[Hacks on the highway: Automakers rush to add wireless features, leaving our cars open to hackers]Greenberg, a senior writer for Wired magazine, had asked Charlie Miller and Chris Valasek — two “white hat” or altruistic hackers — to show him what they could do.So, while Greenberg drove down the highway, Miller and Valasek sat on Miller’s couch 10 miles away and played God.“Though I hadn’t touched the dashboard, the vents in the Jeep Cherokee started blasting cold air at the maximum setting, chilling the sweat on my back through the in-seat climate control system,” Greenberg wrote. “Next the radio switched to the local hip hop station and began blaring Skee-lo at full volume. I spun the control knob left and hit the power button, to no avail. Then the windshield wipers turned on, and wiper fluid blurred the glass.“As I tried to cope with all this, a picture of the two hackers performing these stunts appeared on the car’s digital display: Charlie Miller and Chris Valasek, wearing their trademark track suits. A nice touch, I thought.”The situation stopped being funny, however, when the two hackers cut the engine.“Seriously, this is f—– dangerous. I need to move,” Greenberg said, pleading for the hackers to return power to the vehicle.Greenberg survived to tell his tale, of course, but the ordeal is just the latest in a series of incidents highlighting the startling security vulnerabilities of hundreds of thousands of American automobiles.These incidents have raised the specter of remote-controlled car accidents, in which anarchist hackers or computer-savvy assassins could still be at home in their pajamas while wreaking havoc.On Tuesday, just hours after Wired published its story, Sens. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) and Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) unveiled a bill aimed at keeping Internet-connected cars from getting hacked.“Rushing to roll out the next big thing, automakers have left cars unlocked to hackers and data-trackers,” Blumenthal said.“Controlled demonstrations show how frightening it would be to have a hacker take over controls of a car,” Markey said in a statement to Wired. “Drivers shouldn’t have to choose between being connected and being protected…We need clear rules of the road that protect cars from hackers and American families from data trackers.”[Next dashboard warning may be, ‘Your car has been hacked!’]Even the hackers themselves were taken aback by their abilities.“When I saw we could do it anywhere, over the Internet, I freaked out,” Valasek told Wired. “I was frightened. It was like, holy f—, that’s a vehicle on a highway in the middle of the country. Car hacking got real, right then.” The problem is one of our own creation.Like thousands of other everyday devices, from coffeemakers to power plants, cars are increasingly connected to the Internet. This enables drivers to stream music, watch videos and use GPS.But it also exposes their cars — and therefore the drivers as well — to hackers.Miller and Valasek exploited a weak spot in Uconnect, an Internet-connected feature on as many as 471,000 Fiat Chrysler late-model automobiles, most of them in the United States. Using a laptop computer and a burner phone, they were able to send a series of commands to the car.“Uconnect computers are linked to the Internet by Sprint’s cellular network, and only other Sprint devices can talk to them,” Greenberg explained. By connecting a phone to his laptop, Miller was able to use the phone as a Wi-Fi hot spot and search Sprint’s entire 3G network for hack-able cars.[Hackers warned senators of the Internet’s vulnerabilities back in 1998, but were ignored]Not only does the computer weakness allow hackers to manipulate the locks and turn off the engine, it also enables them to cut the brakes. They can even take over the steering wheel if the car is in reverse.“From an attacker’s perspective, it’s a super nice vulnerability,” Miller told Greenberg.The stunt seems to confirm fears that have worried security experts for several years now. In 2011, researchers at the University of Washington and the University of California at San Diego proved they could remotely disable a car’s locks and brakes.While the researchers didn’t reveal the car manufacturer, Miller and Valasek have made no secret that their hack affects cars made by Fiat Chrysler.Before going public with the news, however, the hackers took their findings to the company. Chrysler has recently released a patch to prevent such hacking.“[Fiat Chrysler Automobiles] has a program in place to continuously test vehicles systems to identify vulnerabilities and develop solutions,” the company said in a statement sent to WIRED. “FCA is committed to providing customers with the latest software updates to secure vehicles against any potential vulnerability.”“Patch your Chrysler vehicle before hackers kill you,” warned Fox News on Wednesday after Wired published its article.Thanks to Miller and Valasek, Chrysler drivers can now guard against such invasions. But the Uconnect weakness is only the tip of an Internet security iceberg. There are many other ways that a car can be compromised by hackers.Other brands, for example, might not be any safer.“I don’t think there are qualitative differences in security between vehicles today,” UCSD computer science professor Stefan Savage told Wired. “The Europeans are a little bit ahead. The Japanese are a little bit behind. But broadly writ, this is something everyone’s still getting their hands around.”In February, hackers demonstrated to NBC 4 in New York how they could override a car’s system using a tiny Wi-Fi dongle plugged underneath its steering wheel.[FBI probe of alleged plane hack sparks worries over flight safety]Other successful attacks have involved “infecting the computers in the repair shop and then having that infection spread to the car through the diagnostic port, or hacking in through the Bluetooth system, or using the telematics unit that’s normally used to provide roadside assistance,” Kathleen Fisher from the federal Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), told NBC.Car makers have been slow to respond to criticism from researchers or hackers like Miller and Valasek.“There is a clear lack of appropriate security measures to protect drivers against hackers who may be able to take control of a vehicle or against those who may wish to collect and use personal driver information,” according to a study compiled by Markey and released in February.The study, “Tracking & Hacking: Security & Privacy Gaps Put American Drivers at Risk,” found, among other things, that:Nearly 100% of cars on the market include wireless technologies that could pose vulnerabilities to hacking or privacy intrusions. Most automobile manufacturers were unaware of or unable to report on past hacking incidents. Security measures to prevent remote access to vehicle electronics are inconsistent and haphazard across all automobile manufacturers, and many manufacturers did not seem to understand the questions posed by Senator Markey. Only two automobile manufacturers were able to describe any capabilities to diagnose or meaningfully respond to an infiltration in real-time, and most say they rely on technologies that cannot be used for this purpose at all.The security shortcomings exposed by Miller, Valasek and others are especially worrying as fully automated cars appear on the horizon.Imagine laying back in your fully automated car on your way to work when someone at a Starbucks miles away takes control and sends your robotic car swerving into oncoming traffic   \n",
       "34  Old guideline: Restrict cholesterol intake to 300 milligrams daily.2015 guideline: No limit is included, but \"this change does not suggest that dietary cholesterol is no longer important to consider when building healthy eating patterns. ... Individuals should eat as little dietary cholesterol as possible.\"Cholesterol warnings have been around in the United States since at least 1961 and have helped shift eating habits from foods like eggs. But scientific thinking on the issue has evolved.Nutritionists now believe that foods high in cholesterol may not significantly affect cholesterol levels or increase the risk of heart disease in healthy adults. But individuals with health issues such as diabetes should continue to avoid cholesterol-rich foods.The government's new stance on dietary cholesterol is in line with that of other nations, which do not single out cholesterol as an issue. Yet it should not be confused with officials' continued warning about high levels of \"bad\" cholesterol in the blood -- something that has been clearly linked to heart disease.Experts emphasize that while the hard limit on cholesterol consumption was removed, that doesn't mean a green light to eat cholesterol-laden foods with abandon.\"Cautions about cholesterol intake are addressed in the text of the [guideline] report, including a clear statement that people do not need to obtain cholesterol through food and should limit their intake of cholesterol and saturated fat as much as possible through healthy eating patterns,\" American College of Cardiology President Kim Allan Williams said.[Cholesterol in the Diet: The Long Slide from Public Menace to No “Appreciable” Effect]Williams explained that Americans can meet these recommendations by eating more unprocessed foods -- especially fruits, vegetables and whole grains -- and by replacing unwanted sugar and fat with plant-based foods, including whole grains, fruits and vegetables.The federal government's influential Dietary Guidelines for Americans, which were released Thursday, are updated every five years, and the debate over saturated fats, red meat, caffeine and salt was especially intense this time around.The guidelines are the basis of everything from school lunch programs to the diets promoted in bestselling books, but in recent years some scientists have begun to question the one-size-fits-all approach. A growing body of research supports the theory that a person's genetic makeup or microbiome (the organisms that live on or inside of you and help to make you who you are) plays a key role in how food affects the body -- and that the impact can be different from one individual to another. That work supports a more personalized approach to diet, which some researchers argue have argued is the future of nutrition science.Read more:This diet study upends everything we thought we knew

       "35  Washington Post reporter Jason Rezaian and his family filed a federal lawsuit Monday against the Iranian government, claiming he was taken hostage and psychologically tortured during his 18 months in prison in an effort by Tehran to influence negotiations for a nuclear agreement with Iran.The suit, filed in U.S. District Court in the District of Columbia, says Rezaian was targeted for arrest to gain advantage in a prisoner exchange and to “extort” concessions from the U.S. government in the multinational talks over lifting sanctions if Iran agreed to limits on its nuclear program.Iranian officials repeatedly told Rezaian and his wife, Yeganeh Salehi, who also was detained for more than two months, that Rezaian had “value” as a bargaining chip for a prisoner swap, the suit says. The filing also links key moments in the nuclear negotiations to Rezaian’s treatment in the judicial system, from arrest to conviction to sentencing, and ultimately his release on the day the deal was implemented.“For nearly eighteen months, Iran held and terrorized Jason for the purpose of gaining negotiating leverage and ultimately exchanging him with the United States for something of value to Iran,” the suit states.Rezaian; his brother, Ali Rezaian; and their mother, Mary Rezaian, are asking for an unspecified sum for damages under the “terrorism exception” to the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act. That law generally bars U.S. citizens from suing foreign governments in domestic courts, but exceptions are made for terrorist acts, torture or hostage-taking by countries, including Iran, that the State Department has designated as state sponsors of terrorism. The suit accuses Iran of all three.Rezaian and Salehi, who was born in Iran and married Rezaian there, were arrested on July 22, 2014, by Iranian agents wearing surgical masks who forced their way into the couple’s apartment and took them for questioning at Evin prison, a notorious site for political prisoners. Salehi was freed 71 days later on a $32,000 bail provided by her brother-in-law, Ali.Rezaian was eventually tried and convicted on espionage and related charges, according to Iranian state media accounts. But the Iranian government has never officially disclosed the specifics of his conviction in a closed-door trial or the sentence imposed by a judge known for meting out harsh punishments.The lawsuit provides details of Rezaian’s incarceration that had never before been publicly revealed.Both Rezaian and Salehi were repeatedly subjected to psychological and physical abuse during lengthy interrogations, the suit says. Their captors at turns threatened to dismember or execute them. Interrogated in isolation and often deprived of sleep, each also was warned that the other might be maimed or executed, and that the same fate could befall other family members in Iran, according to the filing.The ordeal was so intense that Rezaian, Salehi and Rezaian’s brother, Ali, all contemplated suicide, the suit says. Now — almost nine months after Rezaian and four other U.S. citizens were released on the day the nuclear deal was implemented — Salehi, the Rezaian brothers and their mother are still afflicted with trauma and guilt, according to the suit.“For 544 days, Jason suffered such physical mistreatment and severe psychological abuse in Evin Prison that he will never be the same,” the suit states. “He will require specialized medical and other treatment for the rest of his life.”Salehi is not a plaintiff in the suit. Nor is The Washington Post. Rezaian is on leave from The Post for a year as a Nieman fellow at Harvard University.“Iran’s unconscionable actions have inflicted deep and lasting wounds on The Washington Post’s Jason Rezaian and his family,” said Executive Editor Martin Baron, who during the reporter’s imprisonment often criticized what he called Iran’s “system of injustice.”“This legal filing is a stark telling of Iran’s brutal and heartless treatment of an innocent journalist and his wife, and the impact on those who love him. While this legal action is being taken solely by Jason and his family, The Post continues to support the Rezaians through their long and painful recovery.’’The Rezaian lawsuit is the latest attempt by Americans to have the U.S. justice system provide compensation for harms inflicted by the Iranian government — in particular, by the powerful and hard-line Revolutionary Guard Corps, which fiercely opposed the nuclear deal and has tried to thwart many initiatives of President Hassan Rouhani, a relative pragmatist. The corps is named as a co-defendant in the suit.“This was really one of the few ways they felt they could try to hold Iran publicly accountable,” said David Bowker, Rezaian’s attorney. “Ideally, it will deter this kind of behavior toward other innocent people.”Rezaian and his family declined to discuss the case, referring questions to their lawyer. The Iranian mission to the United Nations did not reply to an email requesting comment.In a number of suits brought against it over the years, Iran has not responded, resulting in default judgments.Congress and U.S. courts have provided a legal framework for Americans to sue Iran and be compensated. The State Department has labeled Iran the top state sponsor of terrorism in the world. Sudan and Syria are also on the list.In April, the Supreme Court upheld a law allowing American victims of terrorism and their families to collect almost $2 billion in seized Iranian assets. The case involved relatives of people killed or injured in the 1983 bombing of the U.S. Marine Corps barracks in Beirut. Iran labeled the decision “confiscation” and “theft.”The closest precedent to Rezaian’s case involves Nik Moradi, an Iranian American who was seized during a family visit in 2007 and accused of spying for the United States. More than six months before his release on bail, he said, he was subjected to physical and mental torture during interrogations. In 2013, Moradi and his wife sued Iran in U.S. federal court under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act. The couple was awarded $20 million in a default judgment after Iran failed to respond.One possible venue for securing payment on a judgment is the Victims of State Sponsored Terrorism Fund, created last year by Congress to compensate the Americans held hostage in Iran during the takeover of the U.S. Embassy in Tehran after the 1979 revolution. It also set aside money for victims with court judgments against state sponsors of terrorism, funded by money from a civil penalty paid by BNP Paribas bank for violating sanctions against Iran, Cuba and Sudan.The lawsuit provides dark glimpses of Rezaian’s 50 days in solitary confinement in a small, dank, cockroach-infested cell. Anxiety and depression made him hallucinate, as he perceived the walls moving and talking. The cell was constantly lighted, and a noisy fan hindered his sleep. Rezaian slept on the floor, and prison officials eventually gave him tranquilizers to induce sleep. His food sometimes had concrete, rocks, dirt and other inedible objects mixed in.“During his time in solitary confinement, Jason believed he was losing his mind,” the suit says.In the initial months of his imprisonment, Rezaian was taken blindfolded several times a day to an underground room for interrogations that lasted hours. He was forced to write down his answers, which prison officials translated into Farsi before trying to coerce him to sign without explaining the translations.In an effort to get Rezaian to confess to espionage, the suit says, one interrogator threatened him with beheading. Another held out the carrot of a video confession as his only chance for freedom.“They threatened Jason with physical mutilation, such as cutting off his limbs, and repeatedly told Jason that he would never see Yeganeh alive again,” the suit says.Though Salehi is not a plaintiff, her agony is clear in the suit’s dry legalese.During her detention, Salehi was blindfolded as interrogators hit t   \n",
       "36  Warning: This story includes graphic images.When the gates to India’s Godavari Pushkar Ghat in Rajahmundry in Andhra Pradesh swung open early Tuesday morning, some 5,000 pilgrims rushed in.They were there for a 12-day Hindu religious bathing ceremony called Godavari Maha Pushkaram, convinced a dip in the water would wash away their sins.In the surge of humanity, some pilgrims lost their shoes and, when they fought the crowd to retrieve them, they triggered a deadly stampede — the kind that has devastated the country throughout the years. Witness said some tried to scale a wall near the river. Others were pushed forward. Dozens were trampled as friends and relatives cried out.“It was a frightening situation, with women and children crying for help,” pilgrim V. Satyanarayana told the Associated Press. “The policemen on duty were helpless and it took more than an hour to bring the situation under control.”Police tried to break through, pulling people out by an arm or an ankle. When the crowd died down, at least 27 people were left dead and more than 60 injured.A sea of mismatched sandals were left behind.The Pushkaram festivals occur annually, rotating each year among India’s 12 sacred rivers. The Godavari Maha Pushkaram, however, occurs only once every 144 years.“There is a false belief that taking a holy dip in the river on the first day of the festival will be more auspicious,” Swamy Swaroopanand, a Hindu holy man, told the Associated Press. “It’s the same as taking dip on any other day.”Officials told the Hindustan Times the small city of Rajahmundry was not equipped to handle it. Witnesses told the Times of India there were no clear exit or entry points to the river, which confused the crowd, and amid the chaos, police were not able to clear roads for ambulances waiting nearby.Such stampedes, particularly at places of pilgrimage, have plagued India for years, so much so that despite the vast number of lives they claim, they receive little notice outside the country.As the thousands of faithful stream in through narrow passages to the water, they often find themselves on slippery and uneven slopes and crumbling stairways, called “ghats,” which can become treacherous when panic ensues. Since many are in rural areas, anything amounting to crowd control is sparse or nonexistent. Those who have witnessed these tragedies come away horrified.Still, the incidents are no deterrent to those whose religious fervor and traditions beckon.More than 1,000 people have been killed in stampedes during the past decade, the worst of which came in 2005 when nearly 350 people were killed and more than 200 were injured at a religious festival at Mandher Devi temple in western Maharashtra, according to India Today.Masses were also killed in stampedes near temples in 2006 and 2008. In 2011, more than 100 were killed at a religious festival in Kerala.In 2013, more than 110 were killed in Madhya Pradesh when it was thought that a bridge crowded with people was about to collapse.“The higher tolerance for crowded spaces in India allows for people to get closer, because they don’t feel uncomfortable until it is very packed,” Teresa Moore with the International Centre for Crowd Management and Security Studies in the U.K. told the Wall Street Journal in 2013.Such crowds often grow too large, too fast, Moore said.“People panic and react,” she said. “Couple that with a rumor, which can come out of that feeling of panic, that’s when you can get a surge or a problem.”Part of the problem, researchers say, is that India’s largest religious festivals are often held in rural areas that don’t have the infrastructure to handle them.A 2013 study in the International Journal of Disaster Risk Reduction found that religious gatherings and pilgrimages account for 79 percent of stampedes.“The triggers of human stampedes have been identified from case studies and it is concluded that a simple accident, an intentional act or even a rumor can trigger a crowd disturbance,” it said. “Safety and comfort of religious mass gatherings is primarily influenced by the vulnerability of the location and their accompanying characteristics,” it continued. “Religious festivals, especially when located at remote rural areas and on hilly terrains, and on the foothills or at riverbanks lacking proper pathways always pose a geographical risk to the pilgrims. Steep slopes, uneven topography of the venue, dead ends, slippery and muddy floors, narrow passages, convergence of pedestrian flow to a single point are among the common risks prevailing in religious gathering sites, compromising safety and triggering stampedes.“Devotees visiting the locations even during the late night to early morning lead to huge and prolonged mass gatherings at vulnerable locations.”Before Tuesday morning’s stampede, chief minister Chandrababu Naidu and his family bathed in the Godavari River as the crowd started to swell. When Naidu left, the barricades were removed and the people poured in.“After the CM left, all of a sudden they opened the gates without first trying to control the crowd,” witness V. Ramesh told the Times of India. “This set off the stampede.”Some were shoved down the steps into the river and drowned.After the incident, Naidu took to Twitter to reassure pilgrims.“It is regrettable that lives are lost in stampede at Rajahmundry Ghat. Request people not to panic. Situation brought under control,” he wrote. “I request to people to head to other Pushkar ghats to avoid overcrowding at single ghat. I’m monitoring situation from control room.”Naidu has since put out a statement asking pilgrims not to rush into a single ghat.“Please maintain restraint, follow queue lines and instructions, and head to other Pushkar Ghats when you see excess crowd at one place,” he said. “Pilgrims safety is of top priority to us.

       "37  A few years ago, northern Nigeria was a global epicenter of polio transmission, but a program that mobilized local Muslim clerics, who were once opposed to immunization and are now advocates for vaccination, has helped radically reduce infections, according to researchers.Gambo G. Aliyu, a research fellow in vaccine evaluation at the University of Manitoba in Canada, and his colleagues launched a pilot program in 2008 in Gezawa, an area near Kano, northern Nigeria’s largest city, where there was strong opposition to polio vaccination.Working with a government health agency, they used mobile roadside film shows to educate the community about the risks of polio and show testimonies from caretakers of polio sufferers and those affected by the disease. And they directly involved local Muslim leaders called imams, who had been distrustful of the vaccination programs, to mobilize the communities.“This is the society I belong to, and I know how seriously they take the message from the Friday prayers. I believe they will take the advice of the imam most seriously,” said Aliyu, lead author of the report published Tuesday in PLOS Medicine.In six months of the pilot program, the number of immunized children younger than 5 went from 2,755 to 11,364.Aliyu said that when he was growing up in Jigawa state in northern Nigeria, he saw many children affected by polio, a crippling and potentially fatal disease. He believed, like many, that it was caused by a bad spirit.“The local community believed the disease was spread by a demon spirit and if you were unlucky you might come across it and it would strike you, and your limb would be paralyzed,” he said in a telephone interview. “We didn’t know this is something infectious, something you can get from the environment.”At medical school in Zaria, another northern state, he learned about polio and realized the bad curse was in fact a disease that could be protected against.In 1988, polio was endemic in 125 countries, according to UNICEF. Since then, through aggressive vaccination programs, the virus has been almost eradicated in most countries, with the notable exceptions of Pakistan, Afghanistan and Nigeria.Until two or three years ago, Nigeria, and particularly Kano in the predominantly Muslim north of Africa’s most populous country, was the epicenter of global polio infections, according to UNICEF.Opposition to the vaccine by some local scientists and rumors that the vaccines caused sterility and were a covert attempt to reduce the Muslim population in the north added to resistance. Incidents such as when a small number of vaccine-induced infections in 2006 led to outbreaks bolstered these fears.A milestone for the program was when it gained the support of the Sultan of Sokoto, a spiritual leader in Nigeria, who helped launch the Northern Traditional Leaders Committee for Primary Health Care and Polio Eradication in 2009.In 2010, a team of experts consisting mainly of Nigerian Muslim scientists was formed to assist the committee, which included four of the authors of the new report. The team mapped the high-risk areas in the north within the 12 polio-prevalent states and set up the Northern Religious Leaders Contact Group, assisted by the sharia boards and ministries for religious affairs.The program has since provided training for about 18,000 Muslim imams, through 10 weekly sessions, educating them on the facts about polio, providing a platform for discussion, answering questions and concerns, and arming them with advice they can share with their communities.Imams were given template sermons about polio and the importance of vaccination that they could use during Friday prayers and daily discussions.“The missing link with campaigns in the past was that we didn’t figure out how to connect with the society,” Aliyu said. “From now on, we will maximize the use of traditional and religious leaders as part of the campaign.”When the committee of imams was launched in 2009, there were 384 new wild poliovirus cases reported in Nigeria, most in the northern states. By 2010, the number of reported cases had plummeted to 21.In 2011, however, there were 62 cases in the northern states, and 118 in 2012. Last year the number of cases dropped to 49.According to UNICEF, there have been five cases so far in 2014, three of which were in Kano state.“We’re seeing exciting news in Nigeria,” said Sarah Crowe, chief of crisis communications at UNICEF. “It’s the next big hope.”Read: Virus sleuths, public health officials track mysterious polio-like virus                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",
       "38  Frequent use of high-potency weed may be linked to an increased risk of having a psychotic episode. But milder strains of marijuana, even when used heavily, don't appear to carry any increased risk of psychosis.Those are the headline findings of an important new study published in the journal Lancet Psychiatry yesterday. Researchers obtained data from 410 South London patients sent to the hospital for a first-episode psychotic incident (meaning they hadn't been previously diagnosed with disorder), and compared it to data from 370 control individuals living in the same area.Compared with someone who had never smoked, a weekly user of high-potency weed (defined here as having greater than 15 percent THC content) was about three times as likely to be diagnosed with a psychotic disorder. For daily users, the risk increased to five times.On the other hand, the researchers found no link between frequent use of low-potency weed (< 5 percent THC content) and psychotic disorder.In studies like this one, it's important to remember that correlation doesn't indicate causation. \"The authors clearly point out that they cannot be sure the association seen in their study is causal,\" writes Suzi Gage, a University of Bristol researcher who studies the link between marijuana use and psychosis, in The Guardian newspaper. \"The people who choose to smoke cannabis might be different in a variety of other ways, which could be the cause of the increase in psychosis risk. Although you can control for these in analyses, you can never be sure you’ve adequately adjusted for them.\"Still, the different findings for smokers of low- and high-potency weed are significant, and worth digging into -- especially considering that most of the marijuana consumed in the U.S. today is of the high-octane variety.As the chart shows, the average strength of weed seized by federal authorities has steadily risen over time. Retail outlets in Denver and elsewhere advertise strains that contain 25 percent THC or more. As legalization opponents are forever fond of saying, this isn't your daddy's weed.Just as you'd expect a daily pint of vodka to take a greater toll on your health than a daily pint of beer, it seems reasonable to posit that frequent use of high-octane weed will have different health consequences than a daily toke of the milder stuff. But due at least partially to the economic incentives imposed by cannabis prohibition, low-potency weed is typically harder to come by these days.Today's illicit weed has a lot in common with prohibition-era moonshine. To maximize profits while avoiding detection, many of today's pot growers maintain a singular focus on boosting THC content to the exclusion of all other considerations. The weed they produce is generally good for getting you very high, but little else. The absence of a regulatory framework -- particularly labeling requirements that let you know what you're smoking -- means that buying weed on the black market today is akin to buying a bottle of booze without knowing whether it contains beer or vodka.And chemically speaking, marijuana is a more complicated substance than alcohol. The high of a given strain of bud is determined not just by THC, but by the interaction of dozens of chemical compounds in the plant that researchers are only just now beginning to understand. One of those compounds, cannabidiol or CBD, is actually known to have anti-psychotic effects, and it eases the paranoia that sometimes comes with getting really, really high. CBD and THC are present in roughly equal quantities in low-potency weed, but in the high-octane stuff CBD is essentially non-existent. This is likely one reason why the Lancet study found higher odds of psychosis among users who liked their weed strong.As prohibition eases and legal markets open up, growers now have the breathing room to select for traits beyond high THC content. Demand from new users looking to experience a social high, rather than four hours of couch lock, will likely drive this. The end result may be a resurgence of milder strains of weed that are more akin to fine wines than to bathtub gin. From a mental health standpoint, they'll be safer too.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",
       "39  Alan Gross, the U.S. contractor released Wednesday after five years of captivity in Cuba, was greeted with a, well, surprising art choice while preparing to make a statement on U.S. soil this afternoon.Visible in the background of a widely circulated photograph of Gross, his lawyer Scott Gilbert and spokesperson Jill Zuckman: An image of Che Guevara, the divisive revolutionary figure.“Why is there a Che Guevara pic in background?” National Review Online’s Andrew Johnson tweeted.Others responded with sympathy: “Poor guy gets to his lawyer’s office and has to look at yet another Che glamour shot,” Andrew Grossman tweeted.Zuckman told The Post via e-mail that the photograph was taken at the Gilbert LLP law firm.The print, from a distance, appears to be the same image that’s often emblazoned on T-shirts, posters and other memorabilia. That iconic image is based on a photograph by Alberto “Korda” Diaz Gutierrez; we have more on the history of the image here.Guevara was a leader in the Castro brothers’ revolution to overthrow the Batista dictatorship in Cuba and replace it with a communist government. As the Huffington Post noted: “Cuban-Americans generally revile him for his role in establishing the island’s Communist dictatorship.”In his remarks, Gross made it clear that he did not blame the Cuban people for his imprisonment:“In no way are they responsible for the ordeal to which my family and I have been subjected,” Gross said. “To me, Cubanos — or at least, most of them — are incredibly kind, generous and talented. It pains me to see them treated so unjustly as a consequence of two governments’ mutually belligerent policies.”

       "40  A new form of a dangerous “superbug” may be spreading to humans through contaminated poultry that people handle or eat, according to a study published Wednesday.Researchers focused on a newly identified strain of the bacterium known as MRSA, or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, that they found in people in Denmark. Although most individuals who become infected with MRSA don’t get it from food, the study suggests that this poultry-associated strain may be more easily transmitted from food to people.The findings underscore the importance of reducing the use of antibiotics in food-producing animals to boost their growth, the researchers say. The issue is expected to be discussed prominently at an unusual meeting at the United Nations on Wednesday. The high-level summit is focused on the rising threat posed by superbugs, microbes that can’t be stopped with drugs. It is only the fourth time that the world’s decision-makers have addressed a health concern at the U.N. General Assembly.MRSA, which is resistant to several antibiotics, is commonly found in locker rooms, hospitals, military barracks and other settings where large numbers of people congregate. The bacteria can cause serious infections, including pneumonia and bloodstream infections that can cause life-threatening sepsis.Until now, researchers have known that livestock can carry the bacteria, putting farmers, farmworkers, veterinarians and others who work directly with animals at greater risk. MRSA bacteria have also been shown to be present in foods, including pork, beef and dairy, although outbreaks from food contamination have been rare.“This shows that everyday consumers — the general public — are also potentially at risk,” said Lance Price, a member of the research team and director of the Antibiotic Resistance Action Center at George Washington University.As part of the study, published in the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases, U.S. and Danish researchers utilized a national, multiyear MRSA database at the Statens Serum Institut in Copenhagen. They identified 10 people in urban areas who had carried or been infected with this new strain. None had worked on farms or had direct exposure to food animals. Regardless, no Danish livestock showed evidence of this particular type of bacteria.Using genetic analysis to compare the strain found in the 10 study subjects and those found in people, livestock and food products from other European countries, the researchers were able to trace the bacteria to poultry imported from those other countries, including France, Germany, Italy and the Netherlands.Samples of the strain in the Danes were virtually identical, a finding that suggests all of the individuals were exposed from a common source, most likely contaminated chicken or turkey.“Our findings implicate poultry meat as a source for these infections,” said Robert Skov, a researcher at the Copenhagen institute.In the United States and other countries, officials monitor the food supply for intestinal bacteria such as E. coli, salmonella and campylobacter. But staph bacteria, including MRSA, are not included.Although food is still a relatively minor source of MRSA transmission, Price said the research shows the superbug is changing and evolving in real time.“The more we treat huge gobs of animals with antibiotics and huge gobs of humans with antibiotics,” he said, the greater the likelihood that relatively rare types of transmission will become more common.Read more:Newest superbug found in a Connecticut toddlerMajor global partnership launched to speed antibiotic developmentBehind the scenes of a superbug discovery that made headlines around the worldA deadly, drug-resistant yeast infection is spreading around the world                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",
       "41  Finally, some happy news for wild tigers, animals that are endangered because people traffic in their body parts and raze their habitats: The big cats’ population is for the first time bouncing back after a century-long decline.The World Wildlife Fund says surveys indicate that 3,890 tigers now live in 13 countries across Asia, up from an estimated 3,200 in 2010, when the last wide-scale counts were carried out. Increases were particularly notable in Russia, Nepal, Bhutan and India, which is home to the world’s largest wild tiger population.WWF attributed the rise to better surveys, which are carried out by tiger-range countries and the International Union for Conservation of Nature, as well as enhanced protection efforts in the six years since those nations pledged to double the population by 2022.“We’ve watched tigers decline for decades and have dreamed of bending that curve in the other direction,” said Carter Roberts, president and CEO of World Wildlife Fund (WWF). “This is a big deal.”There are some caveats, of course. The current tiger population is bigger than it was six years ago, but it’s miniscule compared to the 100,000 believed to have lived in Asia in 1900, and it’s still smaller than the estimated 5,000 to 10,000 captive tigers that call the United States home.Surveys remain poor in some countries, such as Malaysia. Last week, Cambodia announced that tigers were now extinct within its borders. And tigers are still prized, and killed, for the supposed medicinal value of their body parts.“Every part of the tiger — from whisker to tail — is traded in illegal wildlife markets, feeding a multibillion-dollar criminal network,” WWF said in a statement.But at the rate of growth over the past six years, the goal of doubling the population by 2022 — the next Chinese year of the tiger — appears within reach.Ginette Hemley, senior vice president of wildlife conservation at WWF, told Scientific American that the goal “is going to be a challenge” and may take longer than planned. “I think it’s doable,” she said, “but it’s not going to happen without big mobilizations of additional resources and commitments.”Read more:One man’s wild idea for saving rhinos: Airlifting them to

       "42  Most of us would probably prefer that nobody found out if we got hacked. Not so for Julie Brill, a commissioner at the Federal Trade Commission who really wants you to know about the time she fell for an email phishing scam.\"These are not the prince-from-Nigeria types of attacks of the past that we're used to,\" Brill said in a recent interview. \"These are deeply sophisticated.\"Phishing scams can affect anyone — even, as it turns out, high-ranking federal officials whose whole jobs revolve around regulating corporate data security practices. The irony isn't lost on Brill, who is trying to turn her personal story into an object lesson for consumers like you and me.As Brill tells it, the saga began earlier this year. A business contact of hers — Gene Kimmelman, president of the consumer group Public Knowledge — sent her an email with an innocuous-looking Google Drive attachment. But after clicking on the link and entering in some of her personal information on the resulting page, she soon realized the truth: This was not a Google site at all.Instead, online criminals had muscled their way into Kimmelman's email account and begun sending fake emails in his name to everyone in the account's address book. (I, too, got a fraudulent email from Kimmelman's attackers.)\"I was busy, I saw an email from this person, I opened it, tried to interface with it,\" said Brill. \"And I pretty soon realized this was a false email from [someone] who was trying to get my data.\"Luckily, even though Brill had given out some of that data, she had made sure that the criminals wouldn't be able to hijack her own accounts. She'd taken advantage of two-factor authentication, a security measure that prevents someone from logging into a website unless they can also reproduce a special code sent to a separate device such as your mobile phone. Two-factor or two-step verification has been adopted by Google, Amazon and other major websites to combat the rise of digital fraud.The loss of information took place on Brill's personal computer, so nothing in the FTC's systems was affected, she said. But she did consult with the agency's IT managers.\"Once they found out I had two-factor authentication and I had changed some passwords, they were comforted that I had done all that I could do,\" said Brill. \"If it had been an attack on our systems, they would have jumped into high gear right away.\"So how did the hackers break into Kimmelman's address book in the first place? That mystery may never be solved.\"It was either a random hack, or someone … knew those on my contact list would expect me to have secret documents to share,\" Kimmelman joked in an email. \"If not a random hack, my reputation may be ruined!\"Kimmelman has since switched email accounts.Brill is leaving the FTC at the end of the month to enter the private sector — a decision that was unrelated to this incident. But her imminent departure makes this an opportune time to highlight the risks of not having two-factor authentication enabled for your sensitive online accounts.\"I say to groups, 'How many of you have two-factor authentication?' and I don't see enough hands,\" said Brill. \"So I say to folks, 'If you get nothing else out of this talk, please go home and turn on two-factor authentication.' \"

       "43  LONDON — The Church of England voted Monday to allow women to serve as bishops, a historic decision that takes the church a step closer toward achieving gender equality.The move effectively shatters the glass ceiling that prevented women here from being promoted to top church jobs and was made possible after reformers and traditionalists reached a compromise that would satisfy parishes opposed to female bishops.At their annual gathering at the University of York, 351 members of the General Synod, the church’s ruling body, voted in favor of the proposal while 72 voted against it and 10 abstained.That it has taken this long for the church, the mother church of the Anglican Communion, to make the move may seem baffling to Anglicans in countries such as the United States, Canada and New Zealand, where women already serve as bishops.It has been baffling for many here, too, with churchgoers and even the prime minister accusing the Church of England of being out of step with the times.But the issue of women as bishops remains highly divisive in the global Anglican community. The majority of the world’s 80 million Anglicans reside in Africa, where many vehemently oppose the idea.In concessions to opponents with theological objections, the package of measures passed Monday allows a parish unsatisfied with a female bishop to ask for a male alternative and take its complaints to an independent body.“You don’t chuck out family or even make it difficult for them to be at home,” Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby said in reference to the traditionalists during a lively, five-hour debate that preceded the vote.When Welby was confirmed to his post last year, he inherited a church still reeling from a crisis sparked in 2012 after a similar proposal to ordain women as bishops was rejected by six votes. At the time, an influential group of lawmakers called for the government to intervene and revoke the church’s exemption from equality legislation.The church approved the ordination of female priests 22 years ago, but they were barred from becoming bishops because of opposition from male clergy. Today, women make up about one-third of all church clergy but are less likely than their male counterparts to receive a stipend for their work.During the gathering Monday, a message was read out from Desmond Tutu, the retired archbishop of South Africa, where women already serve as bishops. “Wow, you are in for a great surprise and a treat,” he wrote. “Yippee!”

       "44  The great shrinking of the middle class that has captured the attention of the nation is not only playing out in troubled regions like the Rust Belt, Appalachia and the Deep South, but in just about every metropolitan area in America, according to a major new analysis by the Pew Research Center.Pew reported in December that a clear majority of American adults no longer live in the middle class, a demographic reality shaped by decades of widening inequality, declining industry and the erosion of financial stability and family-wage jobs. But while much of the attention has focused on communities hardest hit by economic declines, the new Pew data, based on metro-level income data since 2000, show that middle-class stagnation is a far broader phenomenon.The share of adults living in middle-income households has also dwindled in Washington, New York, San Francisco, Atlanta and Denver. It's fallen in smaller Midwestern metros where the middle class has long made up an overwhelming majority of the population. It's withering in coastal tech hubs, in military towns, in college communities, in Sun Belt cities.The decline of the American middle class is \"a pervasive local phenomenon,\" according to Pew, which analyzed census and American Community Survey data in 229 metros across the country, encompassing about three-quarters of the U.S. population. In 203 of those metros, the share of adults in middle-income households fell from 2000 to 2014.Pew defines middle-income households here as those making between two-thirds and twice the national median household income. For a three-person household in 2014, that means an income between about $42,000 and $125,000. The fact that median incomes have declined over this same time frame also means that the bar to get into the middle class is actually lower now than it was in 2000. Pew's metro-level data are also adjusted for household size and local cost of living.The shrinking middle class is in part a reflection of rising income inequality in America, and of the same underlying and uneven economic forces that have fueled the rise of Donald Trump. And as the middle class has been shrinking, median incomes have fallen, too. In 190 of these 229 metros, the median income dropped over this same time.As the middle class has shrunk, Pew points out, the lower and upper classes in America have grown in size and significance. In some metros, the middle class is dwindling primarily because families are falling out of it and into the lower class. The share of households in this bottom tier has skyrocketed since 2000, for instance, in Goldbsoro, North Carolina, a railroad junction with an Air Force base.But in other places, the shrinking middle class is actually a sign of economic gains, as more people who were once middle class have joined the ranks at the top. This has been the case in booming energy hubs like Midland, Texas.In the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area, the share of adults living in lower-income households has actually held steady over this time. The households disappearing from the middle-class, rather, are reflected in the growing numbers at the top (this does not mean, though, that the same middle-class families are necessarily becoming wealthier; changes in the population makeup of the region may also reflect who moves away from the area and who migrates in).In total, 172 of these 229 metros saw a growing share of households in the upper-income tier. About as many — 160 — saw a growing share at the bottom. And 108 experienced both: The middle class shrank as the ranks of both the poor and the rich grew.The places with greatest net economic losses — where the shrinking middle-class has meant a sizable influx of households among the poor — are metro areas that have historically relied heavily on manufacturing, like Detroit, Fort Wayne, Ind., and Springfield, Ohio.In only about a quarter of all of these metros does the middle class make up less than a majority of the adult population today. But the largest metros in the country fall into this group, including New York, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Boston and Washington. In each of these metros, the middle class is relatively small because the upper-class share of the population is larger than average.These same metros also tend to have wider income inequality, reflecting the broad spectrum of jobs in industries from the low-paying service sector to finance and biotech. As a result, not surprisingly, Pew's data shows that metros with greater income inequality tend to have smaller middle classes. When the income distribution is narrower, on the other hand, more people are likely to be clustered in that middle tier between $42,000 and $125,000.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",
       "45  Growing up, Emilie Olsen had an infectious smile, a love for horses and a perfect attendance record. She was a straight-A student and an excellent volleyball player. Emilie “had an extremely sweet spirit about her,” a family friend recalled.On Dec. 11, 2014, the 13-year-old shot and killed herself at home.It was a tragedy that sent a jolt through Fairfield, Ohio, where Emilie had lived since her parents, Marc and Cindy Olsen, adopted her from China when she was 9 months old. Classmates and neighbors mourned a young life cut short.But in the days following Emilie’s death, her parents spoke out against the seeming suddenness of it all. Emilie’s death was precipitated by cruel, relentless bullying, the Olsens said. Worse: It could have been prevented, they claimed, if officials at Fairfield Intermediate and Middle School had been more responsive. Emilie did not have to die, they said.These were the allegations made in an 82-page federal lawsuit the Olsens filed against Fairfield City School District, various administrators and Emilie’s alleged bullies last December. Since then, their fight to hold the school district accountable for their daughter’s death has been met with support from parents and denials from school officials.Former Fairfield City Schools superintendent Paul Otten, who is among the defendants named in the complaint, left his position last month to become the superintendent of the nearby Beavercreek City School District.Just last week, Fairfield Middle School Principal Lincoln Butts, also a defendant, resigned for “personal reasons.”Neither administrator gave specific explanations for leaving. In response to the lawsuit’s December filing, the school district said in a statement, according to WCPO: “The District will be defending the litigation and will be providing appropriate responses in the course of the litigation. The District has no further comment at this time regarding this pending matter.”Meanwhile, the lawsuit alleges that Emilie suffered discrimination because of her race and perceived sexual orientation and that school officials were negligent in their handling of her bullying. The complaint details a downward spiral brought on by unabating abuse.Escalating incidentsIt started in the fifth grade, according to the complaint, when Emilie took to wearing camouflage-patterned clothing and cowboy boots. Her style allegedly prompted jeers from classmates, who called her “fake country” — because “Chinese people don’t wear camo.”Things got worse when Emilie entered the sixth grade, the complaint said. She allegedly became the target of mean-spirited social media messages, as well as a fake Instagram account called “Emilie Olsen is Gay.” One classmate allegedly followed Emilie into the bathroom, handed her a razor and instructed her to “end her life.”Other Instagram accounts surfaced, making sexually explicit comments and derogatory remarks about Emilie’s perceived sexual orientation.In the gym one day, Emilie and another female student got into a scuffle over the fake accounts, and the student allegedly pushed Emilie and slapped her in the face. A teacher allegedly witnessed and broke up the fight but took no action other than to direct the students “back to class.”“I have a bad feeling that if nothing is done then this has the possibility to escalate into something worse,” Marc Olsen wrote in an email to the school’s assistant principals after learning of the fight from the father of a student who saw it happen. He then received a phone call from one of the principals, who allegedly said they were “going to take care of the situation.”According to the lawsuit, no students were ultimately disciplined for the fight or the Instagram accounts. Otten, the former superintendent, told WCPO last May that he didn’t know about the online bullying.“You’re assuming that when we get something (from parents) we start researching kids’ Instagram accounts and printing stuff off,” he said. “I wasn’t aware of it.”Otten added that he has four kids enrolled in the school district. “I can assure you,” he told WCPO, “… there is nothing for me to gain by hiding anything.”The bullying only intensified in seventh grade, the complaint said, when Emilie was placed in the same learning group as several girls who had allegedly harassed her the year before. By then, Emilie had started to inflict self-harm and express suicidal and depressive thoughts.When the Olsens brought these circumstances to the principals’ attention, they were allegedly told that Emilie “needed to buckle down” and cope even though she told an administrator she was “frightened to return to school.”While the cyber-bullying continued, physical messages allegedly started to appear on the stalls and walls of the school’s bathrooms. These scrawled scripts singled Emilie out by name — “Go kill yourself Emilie” — and made reference to Emilie’s race and perceived sexual orientation. According to the complaint, while the messages were in “easily observable” locations and “could not have been missed by anyone using the restrooms, including the school administrators” and teachers, the staff failed to remove them in a timely manner.In October 2014, a group of Emilie’s friends defended her against her bullies in the cafeteria, initiating a verbal dispute as her friends yelled at the bullies to stop “messing” with Emilie. (The students’ incident reports were obtained by WCPO.)At a previously scheduled meeting with the assistant principals the next day, Olsen was not told about the fight involving his daughter, the complaint alleges. In the following days, Emilie started vomiting and feeling unwell. When Olsen informed the school that she would be absent because she was feeling sick, he was allegedly still not told about the fight.Through all of this, Emilie was becoming increasingly withdrawn, barely recognizable from her old self, the complaint says. She seemed to take little interest in her schoolwork, and her grades dropped dramatically. On a personality quiz that Emilie was required to take for class, she described her “bad day symptoms” as “crying, depressing, yelling and screaming, passive resistance, and going into a trance,” the complaint says.Her Internet search history showed attempts to get help, followed by growing despair, her parents say in their lawsuit.Emilie asked strangers online whether they had ever been bullied and viewed articles about celebrities who were bullied in school. She visited a website with the line “I’m just a kid and my life is a nightmare,” and a picture of a young woman’s slashed forearm, with the caption “I’m not strong anymore.”At a school where Asian Americans were allegedly labeled “too smart” and mocked for their “slanted eyes,” Emilie seemed to feel alienated, the complaint says.She sought permission to dye her hair to “look more like a white person.” Her parents allege that she asked her father, “Why can’t I be white like you and mom?”Marc Olsen later told police that Emilie had been suffering from depression and had a history of cutting herself, the Butler County Journal-News reported.“I[‘m] causing all this trouble on earth,” Emilie wrote to a friend on Facebook on Dec. 1, 2014, the complaint says. “It hurts when you have to explain yourself to people you don’t know or like. You feel them judging you, staring at you, talking about you, and I’ve made up my mind, I wanna die.”She went on: “Even if there [sic] adults they hate me. I can’t please anyone with anything I do. Not even my teachers.”Less than two weeks later, Emilie killed herself with her father’s gun.A school’s roleFive days after the suicide, the Olsens were in the throes of grief when they allegedly received a visit from Principal Butts and a group of police officers. According to the lawsuit, the officers coerced the Olsens to let them inside their home, then told Marc Olsen that he was “stirring the pot” and “entertaining rumors” by talking to the media about Emilie’s death.At that point, Ols   \n",
       "46  It’s late August and thousands of teenagers are moving out of home to begin their college careers. While these freshmen are undoubtedly excited about starting this new adventure, as time passes, many of them might wonder whether the benefits of their college education will be worth the cost to obtain that education. Their parents who are footing a bill that may exceed a quarter of a million dollars by the time their child earns the prized college degree may also wonder whether those funds could have been better invested elsewhere.This kind of thinking may be particularly true for students who will borrow tens of thousands of dollars to pay for their bachelor’s degree and yet may find themselves four years later working at a Starbucks or driving a car for Uber.It’s also this kind of thinking that’s reflected in surveys like the one the Pew Research Center conducted a few years ago that reported a majority of Americans said that college wasn’t “worth it” because it didn’t “provide students with good value for the money they and their families spend,” and in the recent household survey by the Federal Reserve Board, where 37 percent of respondents said that the net financial benefit of their education was negative.Those are pretty sobering figures for a country where two out of three recent high school graduates are enrolled in college, up from just one in two graduates 30 years ago. Why are they going to college if it’s not worth it?This is a difficult question to ask, especially considering that President Obama has said that “Higher education is not a luxury. Earning a post-secondary degree or credential is a prerequisite for 21st century jobs, and one that everyone should be able to afford.”So, the question becomes, would students be more satisfied with their college education if it didn’t cost so much?Before answering that question, it’s worth looking in depth at how much it costs to attend college. That’s a hard question to answer because there are wide differences between the sticker price of a year in college — it averages about $40,000 a year at a four-year, private institution and $17,000 at a four-year public institution — and what a student actually pays out of pocket after taking into account financial aid, scholarships, and other tuition assistance programs. (The comparable figures covering just tuition and fees are about $29,000 at a private college and $8,000 at a public college, according to the National Center for Education Statistics.)Thus, answering the question about whether college is worth it from a financial point of view depends on knowing how much financial “help” a student receives from the college.By way of comparison, consider two private and two public four-year, degree granting universities. The first is George Washington University, where I teach economics, and the second is the University of California at Berkeley, where I earned my undergraduate degree. I’ve added Harvard University because that school is often used as a standard for many comparisons, and California State University at Los Angeles because it’s a low-cost public institution.The data come from the federal government’s College Affordability and Transparency Center, which shows the average net price a student pays per year at the particular college or university. The net price subtracts grants and scholarships, which are amounts that a student doesn’t have to pay back, from the total cost of attendance to obtain a figure that reflects a student’s actual costs. (The total cost includes room and board, books and supplies, and personal expenses.) The student will have to pay back any loans taken out to pay for the remaining expenses.According to the CATC, a typical GWU student will pay a net price of $31,443 a year after scholarships and grants. That student will borrow a total of $24,050 and make $276.77 payments each month for 10 years to repay the loan.A typical student at U.C.-Berkeley will pay $16,178 a year after scholarships and grants and have $16,028 in federal loans for a monthly payment of $184.45 over 10 years.For Harvard, a student will pay $14,445 a year after scholarships and grants and take out $11,000 in federal loans for a monthly payment of $126.59 over 10 years.Finally, a student at California State University-Los Angeles will pay $3,713 a year after scholarships and grants. That student will have the same amount of federal student loans as the Harvard student and, therefore, have the same monthly $126.59 payment.Four colleges, four net prices: $31,443, $16,178, $14,445, and $3,713. Which college provides the greatest net benefit?It’s hard to tell. But, what these figures do show is that looking at the sticker price doesn’t reflect the value of a college education.Moreover, even the net price doesn’t tell the whole story, since scholarships and grants aren’t the only things that reduce the cost of college.Students (or their parents) may also qualify for a host of education-based tax breaks, such as the American Opportunity and the Lifetime Learning Credit, and may set aside money in tax-favored education savings accounts, known as Section 529 plans and Coverdell Education Saving Accounts, that reduce the cost of saving for college. In many cases, interest paid on qualified student loans is tax deductible.Finally, the federal government offers several “income-driven” student loan repayment plans that limit the monthly payments to a certain amount of income in exchange for extending the loan repayment period and forgive any loan amount unpaid after that period. One plan recently cut the monthly payments from 15 percent to 10 percent of disposable income and reduced the repayment period to 20 years from 25 years. Most federal student loans qualify for one of these loan repayment plans.Despite these figures, some argue that these loan repayment programs represent “government bailouts” of college graduates, as Lindsey Burke wrote in “The Signal.” Others note that a college degree is no longer required to get a good job, especially since almost four of every ten college graduates are working at jobs that don’t require a college degree. Fruzsina Eordogh is one of those students who dropped out of college to work as a full-time writer for the Daily Dot (Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg, Microsoft’s Bill Gates, and Apple’s Steve Jobs are three of America’s most famous college dropouts.)But, just because the job doesn’t require a college degree doesn’t mean that a college degree isn’t a good investment. People with college degrees tend to keep their jobs during recessions and have a lower unemployment rate over time than those with just a high school degree. Most of the new post-recession jobs require a college degree. As the Pew Research Center found, the “big payoff” to a college degree isn’t so much in earnings but the ability to have and to keep a job.Finally, it’s important to look beyond financial compensation to measure the benefits of a college education. Studies show that people with more education are in better health, their children are in better health, and their marriages are more stable relative to people with less education.The point of these studies isn’t whether college provides a net financial benefit to the student, but whether college provides a net benefit overall.Here, the bottom line is positive. The Pew survey showed that the vast majority of graduates from a four-year institution say their college education helped them grow intellectually and to mature as a person. In other words, college may teach students as much about getting along with people as it does about analyzing Shakespeare’s sonnets.On that score, college provides a clear net benefit, not just for the student but for society as well.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
       "47  BEIJING —She was supposed to be having an abortion last week: This 39-year-old Chinese woman would lose her hard-earned job at a state-owned company if she had a second child. The date was even marked on her calendar, but she was panicking at the prospect.Then she spotted rumors online that China was about to abandon its one-child policy after 35 years. It was, she says, “like a lifesaving straw.” For days, she sat nervously at home watching television, waiting for news.“When I heard the announcement about the new two-child policy, I cried,” she said. “My daughter came in and asked why I was crying, and I told her she was about to have a sister or a brother. She hugged me and cried with me.”Faced with looming workforce shortages and a rapidly aging population, China announced last month that all couples would be allowed to have two children.The one-child policy had extraordinarily far-reaching effects on Chinese society, and its relaxation marks a historic shift.The government says 90 million women, half of them in their 40s, will be affected by the change, once the National People’s Congress approves a new law next year.But it has left many women agonizing about choices they made and the choices ahead of them.This woman asked not to be identified by name because her story could still land her in trouble at work. A former supervisor had warned her not to become pregnant shortly after hiring her, but she had gone ahead and had a child anyway.Her current boss, she says, is more tolerant, but state-run companies have strict rules requiring them to fire employees who have a second child.Even in private companies, many women in China face workplace pressure not to get pregnant, according to women’s rights activists, creating potential tensions and tough decisions if they now decide they want a second child.“The difficulty for women in employment will increase, and gender discrimination probably will be worse,” Wang Pei’an, a spokesman for the National Health and Family Planning Commission, said at a news conference Tuesday, adding that the problem could be addressed through a “joint effort.”The stigma around larger families has been so strong that the 39-year-old woman said she had never even told her college classmates that she had a younger brother.Gradually, though, after her daughter was born, she began to envy couples who had two children. Her daughter, too, grew lonely and wanted a sibling.But the couple decided that they could not disobey the law.The woman began suspecting that she was pregnant shortly after taking a holiday trip with her husband in southern China last month.Finally, her husband bought her a pregnancy test. She didn’t even want to look at the result.“I was scared to face it, because I didn’t want to make a choice between my child and my job,” she said. When it was positive, she said, “it was horrible news, like a thunderbolt out of a clear sky.”And so began the agony of making a decision.She had grown up in a rural part of China, where boys were considered more important and girls usually quit their studies after high school. But she had worked hard, gone to college and secured a job she enjoyed at a state-owned company. She was proud, she said, to be an “economically independent woman.”Her husband suggested that she quit her job, offering to help her find another after the baby was born. But she was worried that he could also lose his job if his employer found out. Besides, she was in line for a promotion and knew it would be hard to find work after a break.An abortion seemed like her only option.“I couldn’t give it all up for an unborn baby,” she said. “I didn’t want to be a housewife for the rest of my life.”Gao Yushuang, another 39-year-old mother, has an 8-year-old girl. She had always wanted a second child, an urge so intense that she was ready to break the law. But eventually she decided that her family could not afford a fine of $15,000 to $30,000, on top of the cost of raising a second child. She decided to stick with one.When she heard on television that the policy was changing, her mother was on the phone even before the anchor had finished speaking.“She asked: ‘What are you waiting for? The policy has changed. You should respond to your country’s call.’?”But Gao was not so sure. For her, she said, it felt like the chance had passed.“If it had happened five years before, everything would have been different,” she said. “I would have been more energetic. My parents and in-laws would have been healthier, too. I definitely would have wanted a baby.”Internet searches for pregnancy-related products surged on China’s online shopping platforms after the news broke last week, state media reported.Demographer Lu Jiehua of Peking University warned that many of the women rushing to take advantage of the policy shift would be those born in the 1970s, potentially involving greater health risks for mothers and babies.For Gao, the balance had shifted. Her parents could become sick at any time, and she thought she lacked the energy to look after and educate another young child, she said.Then there was the stigma of being an older mother, and a fear that she would spoil the child.Gao said she didn’t go into all of this with her mother. To avoid an argument, she simply said she was too old to have another baby.The following day, she said, her phone was full of information about the change in government policy.“It was more stressful than ever,” she said. “Everyone was talking about having a second child. It felt like a time bomb. I felt I had betrayed my mother’s wishes. I was scared I might regret it one day.”So Gao sat down and wrote her future self a journal titled “Why I don’t want a second child.”“If one day my only child leaves me, and I am all alone, I will read the journal, and I will understand why I didn’t have a second child, and it will stop me suffering from regret,” she said.“My tears fell when I was writing. The feeling was complicated and bitter.”Xu Jing contributed to this report.Read more:The human suffering caused by China’s one-child policySee where women outnumber men in the world (and why)Today's coverage from Post correspondents around the world                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",
       "48  A former Marine is fighting her toughest battle yet: Recovering from the devastating effects of flesh-eating bacteria.Cindy Martinez, a 34-year-old mother of two who lives outside Atlanta, doesn’t know how she contracted necrotizing fasciitis and myositis, but it has already cost her both of her feet and her right hand. They were amputated last week, according to a Facebook page set up to support Martinez and her family.Necrotizing fasciitis, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, is a serious bacterial skin infection that spreads quickly and kills the body’s soft tissue.Martinez was diagnosed with the terrifying disease after she was admitted to the emergency room on May 25 with severe pain in her left shoulder blade, according to the family.The next day, doctors were fighting to save her life.Three days after that, doctors were forced to remove dead tissue down the left side of her body.A GoFundMe campaign has raised more than $76,000 to assist the family with medical bills. Martinez’s husband, David, who met his wife in the Marines and currently works as a Gwinnet County police officer, has spent weeks by his wife’s side in the hospital, missing work.“Sure, she was a little scared,” David Martinez told People following his wife’s triple amputation, “but she was able to fight through that fear and say, ‘Enough is enough.’ ”Like many victims, Martinez was young and otherwise healthy when she became infected.Her husband called the source of the disease “a mystery.”“She didn’t have any injury, and initially at home when she was feeling the pain, I looked at where the pain was at and I didn’t notice anything, and that’s what’s troubling,” he told ABC affiliate WSB earlier this month.Ruth Berkelman, a professor of epidemiology at the Rollins School of Public Health at Emory University, told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution that it’s not unusual for patients to be unsure about how they contracted the infection. She said the entry point can be as forgettable as a minor cut or insect bite.“Usually when you talk with patients, if you ask them if they remember having a cut or something, they say ‘yes,’ but not always,” Berkelman told the AJC. “Maybe there was an insect bite or mild abrasion they didn’t pay attention to, but it does happen when people don’t remember anything.”It’s unclear exactly how many necrotizing fasciitis cases there are each year in the United States.According to the CDC, there are “about 650 to 850 cases” of necrotizing fasciitis caused by group A streptococcus each year. But, the CDC says, “this is likely an underestimation as some cases are probably not reported.”And the National Necrotizing Fasciitis Foundation notes that the CDC does not track cases caused by the other bacteria.But the foundation, a nonprofit founded by two survivors of the disease, say the group A Strep statistics combined “with the as yet unquantifiable numbers of people who contract NF from other forms of bacteria” are “frightening.”The disease works like this, according to the CDC:Bacteria spread rapidly once they enter the body. They infect flat layers of a membrane known as the fascia, connective bands of tissue that surround muscles, nerves, fat, and blood vessels. The infection also damages the tissues next to the fascia. Sometimes toxins made by these bacteria destroy the tissue they infect, causing it to die. When this happens, the infection is very serious and can result in loss of limbs or death.The speed at which necrotizing fasciitis attacks — often originating as simple soreness or swelling — takes many victims by surprise.Zach Motal’s case was no different.One day in May, Motal was strolling beside the surf in Fort Myers, Fla.The next day, he was lying on an operating table having the lower half of his right leg amputated.In between, his foot swelled up and turned purple, unleashing such excruciating pain on the 46-year-old that he showed up to the hospital in tears thinking it was broken, according to ABC News.“I figured they were going to put a cast on me and tell me to go home,” Motal told ABC. “I would never in a million years imagine I had a flesh-eating bacteria in me.”Through a small cut on his toe, Motal had contracted group A streptococcus, according to ABC. The bacterium, doctors explained to Motal, is the most common cause of necrotizing fasciitis.The flesh-eating infection is caused by multiple kinds of bacterium, including Vibrio vulnificus, which thrives in the Gulf of Mexico and other warm salty waters during the warmer months.Recent water tests in Fort Myers came back negative for Vibrio vulnificus and doctors have told Motal that he could have contracted group A streptococcus from “anywhere,” according to ABC. Motal, however, is convinced he came into contact with the bacteria during his walk along the beach.“The water had just splashed over my foot and I didn’t think anything about it,” he told NBC affiliate WBBH.Aside from being contracted via an open wound, Vibrio vulnificus can also be transmitted by eating raw shellfish, according to the Florida Department of Health.According to the Centers for Disease Control:An average of 50 culture-confirmed cases, 45 hospitalizations, and 16 deaths are reported each year from the Gulf Coast region (reporting states are Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas). Nationwide, there are as many as 95 cases (half of which are culture confirmed), 85 hospitalizations, and 35 deaths.Two years ago, CNN reported, “the Florida Department of Health reported 11 deaths and 41 infections. Texas reports 15 to 30 annual cases, while Maryland State officials say they see an average of 25 infections per year.”According to the CDC, Vibrio vulnificus infections prove fatal approximately 50 percent of the time. The infection — which can cause vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain and blistering skin lesions — usually kills victims within 24 to 48 hours as it spreads through the bloodstream and begins laying waste to precious tissue.With so little time to act, doctors are sometimes forced to diagnose patients without a blood test and by relying on experience, according to a 2010 Sun Sentinel story.“It’s really a surgical emergency,” Brian Brown, a physician assistant, told NBC affiliate WBBH. “They need to get in and do a fasciotomy and clean out the fascial plane and maybe even amputation.”Doctors had no choice but to amputate Motal’s leg. He told ABC the leg has 2,500 stitches and looks like a prop from a “horror movie.”A master carpenter and avid motorcycle rider, Motal told ABC he’ll have to find a new profession and hobby.Even so, he told ABC, it could have been worse.“The doctor said if I hadn’t have got here when I did, within four hours I would have been dead,” he said.He added: “I think something does need to be done.

Maynard said she just wanted to leave a worthy legacy. And now that she’s gone, the trail she left behind may bring the physician-assisted suicide movement — and the deep divide about it — to a younger generation.Maynard, 29, died Saturday at her home in Portland, Ore., after taking lethal drugs prescribed by her physician. It was a decision she made earlier this year after being diagnosed with terminal brain cancer and given six months to live.Arthur Caplan, of New York University’s Division of Medical Ethics, wrote that because Maynard was “young, vivacious, attractive … and a very different kind of person” from the average patient seeking physician-assisted suicide, she “changes the optics of the debate.” In Oregon, the median age of someone who uses the state’s law to die is 71. Only six people younger than 34, like Maynard, have used it.“Now we have a young woman getting people in her generation interested in the issue,” Caplan wrote in article published on Medscape. “Critics are worried about her partly because she’s speaking to that new audience, and they know that the younger generation of America has shifted attitudes about gay marriage and the use of marijuana, and maybe they are going to have that same impact in pushing physician-assisted suicide forward.“She may change politics right here.”Her story commanded national attention. Before she died, she launched her own campaign with Compassion & Choices, an advocacy group for the terminally ill. She drew support from lawmakers in Connecticut and New Jersey.“I think [legislation] could get out of the Senate,” New Jersey Assemblyman John Burzichelli (D-Gloucester County) told the Philadelphia Inquirer. Burzichelli, the bill’s sponsor, thinks it will pass New Jersey’s state legislature this year.Even the women on “The View” debated her right to die. Big names like Rosie O’Donnell said to have “control over your own death, when you’ve had no control for so long over your illness, I think is the human thing to do.”But “assisted suicide” summons up deep religious and ethical concerns among some critics, including many Catholics and those associated with the Right to Life movement. While organizations have avoided criticizing Maynard, many have come out against the media and advocacy groups for what they consider exploitation of her story to gain a political edge. National Right to Life called Compassion & Choices “ghoulish” in its representation of Maynard’s tragedy.“While we would never criticize Maynard,” National Right to Life said on it Web site, “we are angry that Compassion & Choices would exploit her tragedy for its own malevolent purposes. Maynard’s case is what groups like Compassion & Choices live for, a beautiful young woman about to be cut down in the prime of her life. It matters not that such cases — authentically terminal illnesses — are always the opening wedge after which, once the principal is established, the ‘right’ to be ‘assisted’ expands to a whole panoply of reasons none of which are about terminal illnesses. Compassion & Choice’s agenda extends far beyond terminally ill 29-year-old women.”And even though Maynard’s story, which was documented in TV interviews and popular magazines, inspired a community of supporters, there were also social media efforts devoted to persuading her to choose a different course.Ira Byock, chief medical officer of the Institute for Human Caring of Providence Health and Services, spoke loudly against the practice.“When doctor-induced death becomes an accepted response to the suffering of dying people, logical extensions grease the slippery slope,” he wrote in a New York Times op-ed. He cited statistics in Holland, where the practice is permitted, that claim more than 40 people sought and received doctor-assisted death for depression and other mental disorders. “Even the psychiatrist who began this practice in the 90’s recently declared the situation had gone ‘off the rails.'”Byock added: “Moral outrage is appropriate and needed to fix the sorry state of dying in America. Legalizing assisted suicide fixes nothing. The principle that doctors must not kill patients stands.”In a poll conducted by the New England Journal of Medicine last year, 67 percent of more than 1,700 medical experts surveyed in the United States were against the physician-assisted suicide. That same year, a Pew Research survey showed public opinion was split, with 47 percent of U.S. adults supporting the practice and 49 percent opposing it. Then a Gallup poll that year suggested results varied according to how the question was presented: Some 70 percent of Americans were in favor of allowing physicians to “end the patient’s life by some painless means,” but only 51 percent were in support of allowing doctors to help a patient “commit suicide.”Compassion & Choices President Barbara Coombs Lee, who drafted Oregon’s Death With Dignity Act, argued with Byock on public television.“Hospice and palliative care is the gold standard,” she told Byock last month. “It’s wonderful. But it’s not a miracle. And it cannot prevent the kind of relentless, dehumanizing, horrific decline that Brittany faces, where her disease will cause unending seizures and headaches and nausea and vomiting and pressure in her brain, and the loss of every bodily function, including thinking and moving.”Coombs Lee added: “No palliative care, terminal sedation, or promise of effective palliative care can give Maynard the thing she treasures now … the hope of gaining control over her disease before it takes her life.”Late last month, Maynard took to her blog to address critics.“I made my decisions based on my wishes, clinical research, choices, discussions with physicians, and logic,” she wrote. “I am not depressed or suicidal or on a ‘slippery slope.’ I have been in charge of this choice, gaining control of a terrifying terminal disease through the application of my own humane logic.” Throughout the past month, she said that was the reason for her campaign — to fight for other terminally-ill patients in states without protections.Oregon, Vermont and Washington are currently the only three states that have death-with-dignity laws. Two other states, Montana and New Mexico, have court rulings that protect physicians who help patients die. Bills have been introduced in seven other states.But Caplan believes this is just the beginning.“Brittany Maynard may change this debate,” he wrote. “My forecast is that we are going to see more push to put these laws in the front of state legislatures and to get them on state ballots. We are going to see more states move in this direction. That intimately may be her legacy to the physician-assisted suicide debate.”RELATED: “Brittany Maynard, as promised, ends her life at 29”“Brittany Maynard may wait to end her life, but, like others, she knows the time will come”“Cancer patient Brittany Maynard, scheduled to die Saturday, checked last item on ‘bucket list’”“Cancer patient Brittany Maynard, 29, has scheduled her death for Nov. 1”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",

       "      <td>In one short paragraph, the new report from the nation’s top nutrition panel reverses decades of warnings about dietary cholesterol. Long one of the arch-villains of the American diet, cholesterol need no longer be considered a menace to the public health, the group said, as the Post previously reported.As the panel's report puts it: “Cholesterol is not a nutrient of concern.”Like few other issues, dietary cholesterol - that is, the kind you consume in eggs and other foods - and the fifty-plus years of debate over its role in heart disease shows the profound difficulties in reaching definitive conclusions about nutrition and the reluctance to withdraw public health warnings.The issue of dietary cholesterol, of course, is distinct from the level of cholesterol in the blood, which should continue to be monitored, experts say, because it has been linked to heart disease. According to research cited by the American Heart Association, blood cholesterol levels are determined by heredity or the consumption of foods high in saturated fats.The idea that dietary cholesterol represents a danger goes back at least as far back as 1961, when the American Heart Association warned Americans of the perils of consuming cholesterol-rich foods such as eggs, and liver.The warning about cholesterol was embraced by the first version of the government's \"Dietary Goals\" in 1977, and it has remained a fixture in them ever since. Indeed, when new nutritional labels were introduced in 1994, cholesterol was one of the nutrients that was called out.And as late as last year, the Food and Drug Administration asserted that “Current dietary recommendations continue to recognize the well-established relationship between consumption of cholesterol and its effect on blood cholesterol level.”The cholesterol warnings have been based on the idea that eating cholesterol-rich foods would significantly raise the levels of \"bad\" cholesterol in the blood, and that phenomenon would in turn lead to heart troubles.Whatever its merits, the theory had remarkable staying power, hanging on despite years of doubts from prominent scientists.The flaw in the logic behind the warning is that eating cholesterol doesn't much affect the levels of cholesterol in the blood, at least for humans, scientists have found.As the Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee concluded in its report today: \"available evidence shows no appreciable relationship between consumption of dietary cholesterol and [blood] cholesterol.\"What is remarkable is how uncertain the science was behind the longstanding warning.As far back as 1955, Ancel Keys, one of the key researchers in this field, could conclude in the Journal of Nutrition that repeated studies had shown that \"cholesterol level [in the blood] is essentially independent of the cholesterol intake over the whole range of natural human diets.\"Keys had done repeated studies of the issue. For example, in one experiment, 23 men doubled their cholesterol consumption, another 41 men cut theirs in half. Over four to 12 months, their blood cholesterol levels of both groups failed to show any response to the change , according to Keys.In 1977, as a Senate committee was published the first set of dietary guidelines - which called for limiting cholesterol- three on the committee objected, noting that the Canadian government had recently concluded that \"a diet restricted in cholesterol would not be necessary.\"\"Because of these divergent viewpoints, it is clear that science has not progressed to the point where we can recommend to the general public that cholesterol intake be limited to a specific amount,\" according to the letter from Senators Charles Percy(R-Illinois), Richard Schweiker(R-Pennsylvania) and Edward Zorinsky(D-Nebraska).The recommendation nevertheless made it into the final publication. \"I can't tell you why previous committees did not deal with this,\" said Marian Neuhouser, a member of the current panel.</td>\n",

       "      <td>The world's worst portmanteau is back: Grexit.That's short for \"Greek exit,\" as in Greece leaving the euro. And it's once again a possibility now that the left-wing, anti-austerity party Syriza has won power in the latest elections. The risk, as I've said before, is that the rest of Europe is in good enough shape that Germany finally thinks it can let Greece leave, and Greece's budget is in good enough shape that it finally thinks it can leave too. Neither of them wants that, but neither of them doesn't want it so much that they'd do anything to avoid it—so both might call each other's, as it turns out, non-bluffs if Syriza tries to force Germany to renegotiate Greece's gargantuan debt.Cue the market freakout in three, two, oh, it's already here? Why yes, yes it is. Greek stocks fell 11 percent on Tuesday, another 9.2 percent on Wednesday, before stabilizing up 3.2 percent on Thursday. Three-year borrowing costs shot up to 16.9 percent. And worst of all, Greek banks collapsed between 30 and 45 percent in just the last week. That's enough, as we'll see in a minute, to make it much more likely that Greece leaves the euro.Now, as far as panics go, this one is pretty well-justified. That's because Syriza hasn't just taken a hard line against austerity, but picked the equally hard line, though right-wing, Independent Greeks as its coalition partner, ahead of less confrontational but more ideologically simpatico alternatives. The game of debt chicken, in other words, is very much on.But the weird thing about Greece's debt, as Dan Davies points out, is that it doesn't really matter. Greece, you see, owes €317 billion, or 175 percent of its GDP, but that might as well be eleventy billion kajillion euros—it's about as meaningful and likely to be paid back. Why? Well, the first thing you should know about Greece's debt is that 75 percent of it is held by the \"official sector.\" That's an alphabet soup of lenders that includes the IMF, ECB, EFSF, and European governments. And unlike private sector lenders, they don't care about maximizing their returns, but rather looking like they're maximizing their returns. That means that under no circumstance will they reduce the face value of what they're owed ... but they will reduce interest rates to almost zero and extend maturities to infinity and beyond. So suppose, for example, that you lent me $100 for 10 years at a 5 percent interest rate. If you were Germany, you wouldn't take anything less than that $100 back, but you might give me 30 years at just a 1 percent interest rate to repay it instead. That's still a big help.The good news is that Greece's debt payments have already been cut a lot. The bad news, though, is that Greece's debt payments have already been cut a lot—so there's not much left to do. Greece, economist Zsolt Darvas explains, only owes 0.56 percent interest on a big chunk of its debt, doesn't owe any on another for 10 years, and gets sent back all the interest it pays the ECB. Not only that, but most of its debt is already pretty long-term. That's why, despite its 175 percent of GDP of debt, Greece only has 2.6 percent of GDP of debt payments.So all they can do now is fiddle some more with the interest rates and maturities. Maybe turn 0.5 percent rates into 0.2 percent rates, and 30-year bonds into 50-year bonds. That's not going to free up a lot of cash, though. Maybe 1 percent of GDP. Maybe a little more if the ECB starts buying more Greek bonds as part of QE. This last part is actually pretty clever. The ECB can only buy a country's bonds if it owns less than 33 percent of them, but it owns 34 percent of Greece's right now. That means Greece should want to pay the ECB back right now, so that the ECB can buy more of its debt. After all, when the ECB buys Greek bonds from Greek banks, that turns debt that Greece had to pay interest on into debt that it doesn't have to. So, in Greece's case, QE trades debt payment for debt relief.This is a deal Europe could, and probably would, support. Indeed, even Finland's Prime Minister, who's been more opposed than most to debt forgiveness, has said he'd be okay with giving Greece more time to pay back what it owes. Europe's dirty little secret, though, is that more time will eventually become all the time in the world. Today's 30-year bonds with 0.5 percent rates will become tomorrow's 50-year bonds with 0.2 percent rates, and then, at some point, zero-interest perpetual bonds, aka debt that you don't have to pay interest or principal on, aka not debt at all. Everybody knows this, but nobody can say it, because German taxpayers wouldn't like hearing that Greece will never pay back what it owes, that everyone's debts will be thrown together when there's a United States of Europe. (Oops, pretend you didn't hear that). And that's why Greece's debt is pretty irrelevant. It's a big number that Greece can't pay back, so who cares how big we're pretending it is?Well, Syriza does. They say they want to cut Greece's debt in half. The only problem is that's not going to happen, and even if it did, it wouldn't help much. The question, then, is whether a deal that just cuts interest rates and extends maturities would be enough for them. Another 1 percent of GDP of spending wouldn't save the Greek economy, but it would save a lot of Greek people from extreme poverty. Syriza would have enough money to give food stamps to the hungry, healthcare to the sick, and electricity to people who can't afford theirs anymore, just like it campaigned on. So would this be enough? Maybe not. Greece's austerity is bigger than its debt payments, so just reducing those payments might not reduce its austerity as much as Syriza wants. That leaves one last question. Why is Greece, with 25 percent unemployment, cutting more spending than is absolutely necessary? Easy: Because Europe is making it.Greece, you might be surprised to learn, doesn't need Europe's money to keep its budget afloat anymore. But it does need Europe's money to keep its banks afloat. And that, as Paul Krugman explains, is where Europe's leverage comes from. It goes something like this: Not-so-nice banks you got here, be a shame if something even worse happened to them, if, you know, you don't do all the austerity we tell you to. It's an offer Greece hasn't been able to refuse, because if the ECB pulls the plug on the emergency lending its banks need, the only way Greece could keep its people from losing their money would be to print it. And the only way Greece could do that would be to leave the euro.But it's an offer Syriza thinks it can refuse. It just doesn't believe the ECB would really kick them out of the euro and risk contagion in, say, Spain, where a one-year-old anti-austerity party has surged to the top of the polls. Markets, though, aren't so sure. That's why, as you can see above, Greece's banks started falling right after it became clear there would be early elections that Syriza would probably win, and started free-falling after Syriza did, in fact, do so. And why Greek depositors are pulling their money out of banks at a record pace right now. Better to get your money out now, while you'd still get euros, than to wait and maybe get drachmas that wouldn't be worth as much.This is how the euro ends. Yes, with a bang, actually, and a bank run. This isn't how it was supposed to, though. It wasn't supposed to end at all. The euro, Barry Eichengreen argues, is irreversible, because even talking about leaving it would set off the \"mother-of-all financial crises,\" stopping you from doing so. But what if, Krugman asks, you're already having the mother-of-all financial crises? Maybe it's because, even though you say you want to stay in the euro, markets think your policies will force you out of it. Well, then there's nothing keeping you in, because you're already on the way out. (Freedom's just another word for no banks left to lose). So what we might get here is a failure to communicate. Europe might say, look, yo</td>\n",

It could have been eradicated decades ago but for religious objections to vaccination in Pakistan and Nigeria. Displaced people have now carried the infection to other populations.

       "      <td>Congressional leaders on Tuesday said the bombings in Brussels underscore the need to accelerate the military campaign against terrorist groups and to boost airport security in the United States.Blasts that struck a major international airport and a metro station frequented by European diplomats put Brussels on lockdown Tuesday amid fears the attacks were carried out in retaliation for the recent capture of Salah Abdeslam, the presumed mastermind of the November Paris attacks.The Islamic State, also known as ISIL or ISIS, took credit for the attacks.[The Islamic State claims responsibility for the Brussels attacks]“Our nation stands in solidarity with the people of Belgium and we will renew our determination to prevent more senseless violence against the innocent,” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said in a statement. “Defeating ISIL, al Qaeda and its affiliates will require concerted action by the military, our intelligence community, and our international partners.”House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) also called for international cooperation against terrorist groups and sought to play down worries that Washington could soon be attacked.“We have reached out to the intelligence community and I have received some updates this morning and I have absolutely no reason to believe that there’s a threat here,” he told reporters.Some top lawmakers said the bombings should lead to a push to tighten security at airports.Sen. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) said Congress should use the pending reauthorization of the Federal Aviation Administration to create tighter screening requirements for Transportation Security Administration officers and aviation workers and to boost funding for tightening airport perimeter security.“You can never be too careful,” Schumer told reporters. “We have to look at what happened in Brussels and in Europe and, you know, tighten up even more.”House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) pointed out that a bill the House plans to vote on soon would require comprehensive security assessments of overseas airport security and better cooperation between the Department of Homeland Security and its foreign counterparts. On Monday night, the House passed a bill requiring the department to produce an annual scorecard of foreign countries’ border security efforts.After last year’s terrorist attacks in Paris and San Bernardino, Calif., Congress stiffened the requirements for participating in a popular visa waiver program that expedites tourism and short-term business travel to the United States. The House also passed legislation that would halt the resettlement of refugees from Syria and Iraq, the two countries with the largest Islamic State presence, in the United States, but that bill was blocked by Democrats in the Senate.Rep. Richard Hudson (R-N.C.), who wrote an early draft of the refugee resettlement legislation, said he hopes the attacks will spur the Senate to reconsider the bill.“Brussels underscores the need to be vigilant,” he said.On the campaign trail, Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump caused a controversy in December when he called for a temporary ban on all Muslims entering the United States following the Paris and San Bernardino attacks. The proposal drew rebukes from congressional leaders in both parties.On Tuesday, he again called for restricting entry to the United States without specifically reiterating his call for a temporary ban on Muslims.“I would close up our borders to people until we figure out what is going on,” he said in an interview with Fox News. He added: “We’re taking in people without real documentation. We don’t know where they’re coming from. We don’t know what they’re — you know, we don’t know where they’re from, who they are. You look at them and look at them from any standpoint — they could be ISIS, they could be ISIS-related.”Republican leaders did not comment on Trump’s demands. But some Democrats refuted the idea that barring the doors to the country would help.“I don’t think the answer is to keep people out of the United States,” said Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.), who was in Brussels for a security conference last week and left the city Monday. She added that the United States needed to embrace “more understanding and tolerance” to determine “how we can cooperate with people who may not be exactly like us to address [this threat] together.”Shaheen described the “heightened presence” of police and military guards on the streets of Brussels and in the airport that was attacked as noticeable in recent days. She was in the city when Abdeslam was captured, a moment she said seemed to bring “some closure” for locals and authorities in Brussels — a city that has become accustomed to living on heightened alert.But that closure was soon punctured by the attack, which Shaheen called “a despicable act by cowards” deliberately targeting “places where people will be. They’re targeting symbols of civilization … just as we saw with the 9/11 attacks in the United States and with the Paris attacks.”For the most part, lawmakers’ reactions to the Brussels bombings steered clear of political finger-pointing. But the chairmen of the House and Senate armed-services committees used the occasion to restate their grievances with the Obama administration for not giving Congress a written “strategy” to fight the Islamic State — and not doing enough to rout the extremist network militarily.“Time has never been on our side in this conflict, and the failure to recognize the urgent realities of the war against ISIL will carry a grave price for our nation and our people,” Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) said, calling the Brussels attack “sadly predictable.”[Brussels attack intensifies pressure on Obama to explain Islamic State strategy]House Armed Services Committee Chairman Mac Thornberry (R-Tex.) said the attacks highlight the need to beef up U.S. military budgets.“The world is growing more dangerous; we have cut our military too much; and it is up to the political leadership in this country to take the action necessary to enable our service men and women to defend American lives and interests,” he said.Kelsey Snell and Paul Kane contributed to this report.</td>\n",

       "      <td>America, please eat more fruits and vegetables.A new report by the Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee, which convenes every five years, says that the rest of the American diet is having devastating effects: about two-thirds of American adults are overweight or obese. And maybe worse, about half of American adults - about 117 million people - have preventable chronic diseases related to poor diet and physical inactivity, the group said.This dismal diagnosis is the foundation for the group’s report, which provides the scientific basis for the nation’s Dietary Guidelines, the advice booklet that will be issued by the federal government late this year.“I wouldn’t call it gloomy,” said Marian Neuhouser, a committee member from Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, WA. “I call it reality.”The committee's report amounts to a scientific update regarding what is known about healthy eating.For the first time, the committee is recommending that the government should consider the environment when telling Americans what they should eat, a move that could have a significant impact on the amount of meat people eat.It also, for the first time, addressed concerns about coffee, saying that there is strong evidence that moderate consumption is not associated with long-term health risks.The panel also reversed decades of warnings about dietary cholesterol, as The Post previously reported. For years, the Dietary Guidelines have advised Americans to consume no more than 300 milligrams of cholesterol a day, a warning that limited egg consumption for many Americans. The limit arose from the belief that eating cholesterol would lead to high levels of \"bad\" cholesterol in the blood. But, the group concluded, no such warning is necessary.[U.S. government: Cholesterol isn't as bad as we thought]\"Available evidence shows no appreciable relationship between consumption of dietary cholesterol and [blood] cholesterol,\" the report found.The bulk of the report issued today, which runs to 571 pages, outlines reams of scientific evidence about what's good to eat. And in terms of dietary advice, it can be summarized as follows:- A healthy diet is rich in vegetables, fruits, whole grains, low- or non-fat dairy, seafood, legumes, and nuts.- It is moderate in alcohol- And it is lower in red and processed meat, and low in sugar-sweetened foods and drinks and refined grains.The government has published dietary guidelines since 1977, and during that time, those guidelines did not avert what many nutritionists consider a dietary disaster -- the nation slipped into an obesity epidemic.\"In the past, we haven't been able to change the way people are eating very much,\" said Alice Lichtenstein, a committee member and nutrition professor at Tufts University. \"One of the major focuses of this report is, rather than nutrients, the whole diet.\"[So can I binge on eggs now? Here's what you need to know.]So in compiling the evidence on diet and health, the group took a different tack from previous committees. Rather than focusing on the health effects of individual nutrients, it focused on how entire diets affect health.The committee reviewed studies that looked for associations between diets and major diseases such as cancer, heart troubles and diabetes.With regard to what people ought to eat, their research turned up the most consistent evidence for the health benefits of fruits and vegetables. The evidence for the benefits of whole grains was only slightly less consistent.And with regard to potentially dangerous items, the group found \"moderate to strong evidence\" that higher consumption of red and processed meats, refined grains and sugar-sweetened foods and beverages are detrimental.Read more:How cholesterol went from 'public menace' to 'not a nutrient of concern'How many eggs a day is okay?

       "      <td>This month The Washington Post staff said a melancholy farewell to its beloved longtime owner and publisher, Donald Graham. Graham sold The Post to billionaire Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos in what many saw as a selfless and courageous act to save the newspaper, and all of us, from the agony of a slow, undignified decline and death. Bezos has pledged his resources to a long game of innovation and recovery.When newspapers say goodbye to high-profile staffers, they sometimes prepare a mock-up of Page One, with stories about the departed. These things are not always entirely reverent. When I left the Miami Herald to join The Post in 1990, the Herald made a page for me, emphasizing my penchant for risky, provocative “stunt” journalism. I still keep this page on the wall of my home office. The main headline reads: WEINGARTEN SHOCKS WASHINGTON — editor’s grand entrance to nation’s capital marred by Nazi gaffe. The doctored photo shows me entering a stupefied Post newsroom dressed as Hitler and sieg heiling.That sort of parting shot was an easy call, in my case; I’m a sleazeball. But what’s the right way to irreverently send off Don Graham, whom everyone adores? I have no idea. I can tell you only what I wrote. We all know about Don Graham’s famously self-effacing personality — his ritual washings of Post reporters’ feet; the time he donated a lobe of his liver to save the life of a copy editor’s terminally ill schnauzer; his insistence that his take-home pay never be higher than that of the guy at the Springfield plant who re-stocks the vending machine, etc.Similarly, everyone knows about Don’s charmingly homely and unpretentious sweaters (though few are aware that, in an act of monastic self-abasement, he knits them from his own nose hairs). And of course we’ve all admired the unusual way he atones for hubris every time his newspaper wins a Pulitzer: by eating a live cockroach.So I think all of us need to forgive Don for what sometimes happens in private, after hours. We need to understand the intense stress that the burden of maintaining an extraordinary public humility brings to a man born into the upper crust of Washington society, expected to behave like an avaricious, conscienceless plutocrat.So let us not judge Don for his infamous nighttime solitary orgies, writhing naked on piles of his family’s cash, cackling, “Mine, all mine!” Or that he sometimes buys yachts and then throws them away after using them once. Or that every year, on his birthday, he hires the New England Patriots to play the Green Bay Packers in his back yard.None of that makes any difference to us. To us, Don will always be the quiet guy on the edge of the crowd at every newsroom Pulitzer ceremony, smiling shyly, taking no credit, content to bask in the light of reflected glory, because he knows, in his heart, that anytime he wanted, with a single phone call and a signature on a check, he could have any one of us murE-mail Gene at weingarten@washpost.com.

       "      <td>NEW YORK – Last Wednesday afternoon, I interviewed New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio (D) in his office at New York’s City Hall. Here is a transcript of the interview, which is the basis of my Monday column on de Blasio and the city. My questions have been shortened and I have included some background on issues that might not be familiar to those who live outside New York. My thanks to Ross Tilchin and Jeremy Waldron for helping me put together this transcript.What are some of the lessons learned in tour first months in office?I think there’s a real, extraordinary level of opposition to change that goes to the heart of the matter. If you’re fighting inequality, if you’re talking about income inequality and other structural inequalities in this society, a lot of people take exception to that, and we did not foresee some of it manifesting the way it did. The good news is once you see it one time, you recognize it thereafter.I think the path that we’ve all been on is not sustainable and not healthy. The decline of the middle class, talked about a lot, but has to be understood very sharply. [It] is very mature and very physical for people. There is a real diminishment of their lives with no turnaround in sight, and that has to be addressed head on. And yes, that will mean changing some of the ground rules, but it has to happen for the good of us all.There will be a lot of opposition, and I think we’ve grown a little stronger coming to recognize the shape of the opposition, and feeling comfortable with our ability to grapple with it. I think there’s a related point, which is that while you have an opportunity to act, we’ve seen too many situations where there were delays that really undermine the ability to do something tangible in people’s lives.So, our theory of the case from the beginning was: Do a lot quickly and make a real tangible impact, basically, pre-K, afterschool, reforming Stop and Frisk. These are not theoretical moves. These are very tangible moves that affect people’s lives down in the grassroots and in the neighborhoods. … I’ve learned … that the merit of that approach is even greater than I might have imagined, and it actually perfectly fits the fact that that there will be intense opposition. Part of how you grapple with intense opposition is by creating real organic momentum, by actually doing something for people, and then they rightfully buy into it.Talk about your fight with Eva Moskowitz. [Note to reader: Moskowitz, who served on the New York City Council with de Blasio, is head of the Success chain of 22 charter schools. As the New York Daily News noted, de Blasio “blocked three Success charter schools from planned co-locations in [New York City] public school buildings while allowing five others to go ahead.”]It wasn’t a sweeping attack on her organization, either. This is part of understanding how the opposition is structured and how it plays out because, look, you’re talking about what I think was, at last count, about a $5 million ad campaign against us really over a few fairly small decisions that were consistent with everything we said we were going to do.So clearly it’s not just about that decision. Let’s look it in the face. There are a lot of other things going on. People funding these efforts have more than one agenda, and some of them may feel discomforted by the bigger changes we’re making.When the campaign was going on, this issue came up of course. Bloomberg was rushing to make a lot decisions on the co-locations of schools, taking not just charters, but also newer versions of public schools and putting them into existing schools. An idea that I’ve said from the beginning can be done properly just wasn’t being done properly. They were rushing. They were not engaging parents. A lot of times, a very unequal outcome occurred where the new school, coming into the building did very, very well [while] the school that had been there for decades, generations, was put at a disadvantage, it lost a lot of its rights in its own buildings.And parents were very upset. If your child doesn’t have the same options in their own school building because another entity came in, it’s a natural tension point. So, we said we’re going to review all the decisions because a lot of them were rushed. A lot of them were last minute by the Bloomberg administration — classic of any administration turning over, certain administrations try and rush at the end to put their imprint.We said we were going to review them all. We reviewed them all. Of the forty-five co-locations, we said thirty-six passed muster. We didn’t find, by our criteria, any tangible reason to turn them down. We found nine that were problematic. Six of the nine were public schools, three were charter schools. Of the overall number presented to us within that forty-five, seventeen were charter schools of which we approved fourteen. Eight were from Success Academy, Moskowitz’s organization, of which we approved five.So, again, accuse us of being logical. We thought, ‘Well, if we approved objectively after our own objective analysis as a new administration, we said most of the charters were acceptable, we found most of the Success Academy schools were acceptable, people would see that as balance.” Again, certain individuals, certain organizations didn’t, I think, want to see it as balance, even though it was.And the same thing with what I’ve said on the co-location issue. I said there needed to be a moratorium until we created a process that was more fair to parents. . . . Moratorium does not mean an end; it means a pause while something is changed and updated. So we’ve always intended to have a process for co-location that was more fair, but would allow for charters to co-locate. It’s always been the plan, it’s very publically been that. But that’s why I think what came at us had something to do with the narrow charter issue and a lot to do with other things as well.What kind of other things?I think the fact that we’re fighting inequality, again, certain people, ideologically, are discomforted by that. The fact that my central agenda item was a tax on the wealthiest New Yorkers to fund our pre-K and after-school initiative. I think a lot of folks of means didn’t like that, and some of them expressed it through this other issue.You didn’t get the legislature to enact the tax you sought to finance your universal pre-Kindergarten initiative, although the legislature enacted a five-year universal pre-K plan. How do you feel about that? [Note to readers: De Blasio originally sought to finance his universal pre-Kindergarten initiative with an increase in the top income tax rate for New Yorkers with incomes of over $500,000 from 3.876 percent to 4.41 percent. The tax increase was opposed by Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D). The New York state legislature approved five-year funding for de Blasio’s pre-K program but did not finance it with his proposed tax increase.]I believed and I still believe that the tax was the most reliable way to go about this. I thought it was fair. What became clear in Albany was the way to get it done was a different way. But we set a high bar. We said we don’t want an amount of money that won’t allow us to do this, and we don’t want one year’s funding, or two years funding, we need something that mirrors our original vision. Our vision was a five-year play out of this so we could really build to full-day pre-K for every child and after-school programs for every middle-school child and then sustain it.Once you introduce this new element to our school system, we need it for the future of our schools. Parents have every right to expect it. You can’t turn back. So the idea was we needed something substantial enough to achieve it and sustain it. The final plan passed in Albany actually was that. I think earlier on, it did not look like it would be that substantial and have that kind of time-span, but when push came to shove, and I give all the credit to the grassroots, we orga</td>\n",

       "      <td>Ice skating’s popularity boomed during the 19th and early 20th centuries due to a long string of cold winters in the Northern Hemisphere and improvements in the design of ice skate blades and footwear. A good supply of frozen ponds, lakes, and rivers across the northern half of the United States enabled people to enjoy ice skating for the cost of purchasing a pair of skates, which was as low as 25 cents in 1862.Looking back at sports in the 19th century, ice skating was one of the only sporting activities of the day that involved both men and women and people of all backgrounds participating in the same activity together. By 1866, ice skating’s popularity rose to the level that prompted Frank Leslie’s Illustrated Newspaper to proclaim that ice skating was the “National Winter Exercise” of the United States. Large gatherings of people, often well-dressed, would ice skate together on a large body of water which was frozen smooth by winter’s chill.Cold winters of the 19th centuryThe Little Ice Age was a period of cooling of the Northern Hemisphere that began about 1300 and lasted until 1850. Increased volcanic activity is one theory for what caused the weather to cool. The eruption of Mount Tambora in 1815 is responsible for the infamous “Year without a Summer” in 1816 which produced frost and freezes even during the summer months from Northern Virginia through New England and into parts of Europe. The resulting cold winters of the 18th and 19th centuries helped set the stage for the development of modern ice skating.Analyzing temperature readings from a diary recorded near Philadelphia, Pennsylvania during the early 19th century, it can be noted that the low temperature dropped below zero degrees roughly three times more frequently during the winters of the early-to-mid 1800s than in recent times. The weather data in the diary is not official, however, but trends can be surmised that the winters have warmed since 1800.After the end of the Little Ice Age, during the late 19th century and into the early 20th century, winters remained fairly cold overall and ice skating continued to flourish. Some may even argue that winters up until the 1980s were fairly good for outdoor ice skating from Virginia northward.We certainly know that this winter has not produced good outdoor ice skating conditions in many regions with unusual winter heat in Europe and record warmth in the United States.Ice skating historyThe first ice skates were made from polished animal bones and are were primarily used to help with transportation over ice. Poles were used by the skater for pushing across the ice since the bone skates did not have sharp edges which would allow the skate to be used for thrust. Bone skates go back at least several thousand years.By the 18th century, ice skates had metal blades which were mounted to a wooden platform that was then strapped to a shoe or boot. The first ice skating clubs were formed in Europe and figure skating and speed skating started to emerge as specialized forms of ice skating. The first instructional book about ice skating was published in London in 1772. Ice skating through the 18th century was primarily done by men, however, and skating was not particularly popular in the United States.The popularity of ice skating increased dramatically during the 19th century. Frozen ponds, lakes, and rivers were abundant during 19th century winters in many parts of the United States and Europe and ice skates began to be mass-produced, making them affordable to the public.When ice conditions were right, ice carnivals would be organized in cities like New York and hundreds of people would gather on the ice with skates and sleds. The frozen ponds and rivers would become a melting pot of skaters from many different backgrounds and income levels who often donned their winter’s finest clothing for the event.Ice skate designs improved during the 19th century. A skate with a fixed blade that was clamped to a shoe or boot was invented by E V Bushnell in 1848. In 1865, well-known figure skater of the day, Jackson Haines, developed a skate with a blade permanently fixed to the boot. Haines’ improvements to the ice skate made jumping and spinning much easier and safer than with the older ice skate designs. The sport of figure skating quickly developed. By 1908, figure skating was made an Olympic sport.Ice hockey also developed in the 19th century out of stick-and-ball games that were played on both land and ice. By 1875, organized hockey games were being played in Montreal, Canada and by 1910 the National Hockey Association (NHA) was formed which was later reorganized to the National Hockey League (NHL) in 1917. United States teams were added to the NHL in 1924, starting with the Boston Bruins.Ice skating during the Civil WarThe American Civil War was fought during a time when ice skating was very popular. During the winter months, when the soldiers were in camp, they would sometimes ice skate for enjoyment and to pass the time. One of the more interesting accounts mentioned how a regiment of Mississippi soldiers learned how to ice skate on the frozen Occoquan River near Manassas, Virginia during the first winter of the Civil War. The soldiers from the deep south had not experienced frozen rivers before heading north to war. Here’s an account from Captain E. Howard McCaleb of the 12th Mississippi Regiment:In December, 1861, we went into winter quarters at Davis’ ford, some six miles from Manassas, on the Occoquan river, in Prince William county, Va., and there whiled away the time drilling and doing picket duty until the middle of March, 1862. It was there we celebrated the anniversary of the secession of Mississippi, on the 9th of January. It was there that we first endured the hardships of a Virginia winter and learned to skate on the ice of the frozen Occoquan.When Davis Ford Road was straightened at the Occoquan River almost 20 years ago, the camp location of the 12th Mississippi Regiment was bulldozed. Uniform buttons, bullets, and one of the soldiers’ ice skates were recovered. A photo of the ice skate blade and uniform buttons is included above.Artificial iceDuring the 19th century, there were efforts to expand ice skating to indoor venues and to extend the season of skating. Because the technology of refrigeration of ice rinks had not fully developed, artificial ice was invented as a substitute for skating. The artificial ice was made out of hog lard and salt.Artificial ice rinks were built as early as 1844 and the surface of artificial ice was described as “convenient” for skating. Artificial ice fell out of favor primarily because the ice substitute smelled bad. In addition, refrigerated ice rinks were getting established by the end of the 19th century and into the early 20th century which rendered the lard and salt substitute obsolete.Figure skatingIn 1865, Jackson Haines invented an ice skate blade which was screwed directly into the boot. Using the sturdy ice skates, Haines introduced a style of skating that combined ballet and dance on ice and involved more athletic jumps than was possible with the older, clipped-on skates. He also was the first to accompany skating routines with music.Haines realized that his new style of figure skating was more widely accepted in Europe than the United States so he moved to Vienna, Austria and became famous as a figure skater. Today, Jackson Haines is known as the father of modern figure skating.A few decades later, other popular figure skaters like Irving Brokaw would follow Haines. Brokaw represented the United States in the Olympics in 1908 and his book, “The Art of Skating,” became well-known as the how-to-guide for figure skaters.Many different figure skating clubs existed during the the 19th century and into the early 20th century. In 1921, the United States Figure Skating Association (now known as U.S. Figure Skating) was formed. Today, figure skating is one of the most watched sports in America.Ice skat</td>\n",

       "      <td>The adolescent years are when people's bodies are supposed to start the ascent to their physical peak. Teenagers are growing like beanstalks. Their hormones are raging. They're eager for new experiences. By all accounts, this should be among the most active periods in a person's lifetime.Except it turns out it's not.In an eye-opening study involving 12,529 Americans ages 6 to 85, researchers mapped how physical activity changes over a lifetime. The participants, part of the 2003-2004 and 2005-2006 cycles of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, wore accelerometers, devices that measure movement, for seven consecutive days. For the purposes of the analysis, researchers counted all types of movement, not just exercise.The first thing to note about the results, published in the August issue of the journal of Preventive Medicine, is that physical activity appears to be at its highest at age 6. If you've ever seen a squirmy kindergarten class that shouldn't be a surprise.Vijay Varma, a National Institute on Aging researcher and lead author of the study, said that there has been a belief that physical activity gradually declines across the entire life span. But according to the new data, there seems to be a sharper-than-expected decline during childhood — starting in elementary school and continuing through middle school and high school. By age 19, the average American is as sedentary as a 60-year-old.“At 60-plus, many people have health issues that might cause a restriction in movement, but why is this happening at age 19? It suggests that the social structures in place may not be supporting physical activity,” Varma said in an interview.He theorized that the modern school day, which requires sitting for large amounts of time and where recess is often compressed into 20 to 30 minutes a day, may be partly to blame. There's also the issue of early school-bell times, which researchers have found lead to sleep deprivation.“The timing of school isn’t consistent with biology of when kids wake up and go to sleep,” he explained.Varma and co-author Vadim Zipunnikov, assistant professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, point out that the data shows that school-age children were the most active between 2 and 6 p.m., or after school.Another reason for the sedentary day is likely to be screen time. Studies about how long we spend parked in front of our TVs, laptops, tablets and phones tend to become outdated quickly because of the constant rollout of new technology, but the numbers have been consistently high — as much as seven to nine hours per day. While the American Academy of Pediatrics recently loosened its recommendations for screen time, almost everyone agrees that too much of it leaves less time for physical activity, which can lead to a higher risk of obesity and depression.Calling the end of adolescence a “high-risk time period for physical inactivity,” the study confirms that most children are not getting the minimum amount of activity — at least 60 minutes of a moderate-to-vigorous workout — recommended by the World Health Organization. Among 6-to-11-year-olds, 25 percent of boys and 50 percent of girls were not meeting the target. For adolescents ages 12 to 19, the situation was even more dire, with 50 percent of males and 75 percent of females falling short, the study found.The next surprise in the study involves people in their 20s. The data show activity levels go up during this period — and this is important because this is the only period when people are moving more. Varma calls this a “catch-up” period and believes this, too, may be related to social factors. While the increase in activity was spread throughout the day, there was a noticeable spike in the early morning as compared to teenagers. According to the study, “emerging adulthood represent a period of multiple life transitions, including initiation of full-time work, increased household responsibilities, and changes in family structure including marriage and becoming a parent.”As expected, physical activity starts to decline at around age 35, and that trend continues through midlife and beyond. That's consistent with previous studies and attributed to the wear and tear on our bodies as we age.The timing of physical activity showed that as children age, their physical activity moves later and later in the day until it flips after age 19 to more activity in the mornings.“These findings broadly suggest to us we really need to start looking at when individuals are being more active so we can home in on what is occurring,” Varma said, “and start to design physical activity interventions that might target those behaviors.”Read more:Fathers sing more to daughters and roughhouse with sons, study findsAs bike commuting soars, so do injuries.

       "      <td>Hurricane Fred, which formed over the weekend in the far eastern Atlantic, is truly one of a kind. Not only has Fred set the record for easternmost hurricane in the tropical Atlantic Ocean, it prompted the very first hurricane warning for the Cape Verde Islands and has provided the first satellite view of a hurricane in the region since weather satellites were launched into space in the early 1960s.Hurricane Fred was born from Tropical Depression Six, which formed early Sunday morning just west of the coast of Africa. The system was quickly upgraded to Tropical Storm Fred, remarkably far east in the Atlantic. Then on Sunday night, forecasters at the National Hurricane Center saw enough strength in Fred to make it the second hurricane of the 2015 season, which also made it the easternmost hurricane formation on record in the Atlantic Ocean.Sort of. A slight qualifier is needed: Fred now holds the record for the easternmost hurricane formation in the tropics. Looking back through the annals, just 11 hurricanes formed east of 30 degrees west, and of those, 10 were in the deep tropics (classic “Cape Verde” hurricane formations). Back in 2005, Hurricane Vince briefly reached hurricane intensity while tracking toward Portugal and was further east than Fred when it did so. It was also much farther north, and outside the tropics. These records extend back to 1851.[In new record, three Cat 4 hurricanes spin simultaneously in Pacific]The other 10 storms — the classic Cape Verde hurricanes in the tropics — quickly recurved to the north, but Hurricane Fred is the first to actually pass over the Cape Verde Islands as a hurricane.Like the other storms shown on this map above, Hurricane Fred is forecast to track to the northwest. On Monday morning, Fred’s peak winds were 85 mph, estimated from satellite, and the storm was moving northwest at 12 mph.Two more firsts from Hurricane Fred: for first time ever, the Cape Verde Islands are under a hurricane warning. It’s also the first time we have a satellite image of a hurricane over the islands. The only other time a hurricane formed over the islands was in 1892 — long before the satellite era.Although environmental conditions favor Fred to strengthen on Monday, a combination of factors will weaken the hurricane over the next few days, including drier air, cooler water temperatures and increasing wind shear, which acts to tear tropical cyclones apart.Hurricane Fred formed from what we call an African easterly wave — an area of low pressure that moves west off the coast of Africa in the trade winds that can serve as the seed for hurricane formation. Interestingly, for easterly waves to make the long journey across the Atlantic Ocean and become a threat to land, they must remain relatively weak at first to avoid getting steered northward through weaknesses in the vast area of high pressure that tends to dominate the Atlantic in the summer.The current model analysis of the mid-tropospheric steering winds shows this area of high pressure — the subtropical ridge (below). The gray streamlines show the high-level winds that steer stronger storms. Weaker storms are steered by winds lower in the atmosphere, thus they are able to make it farther west toward North America.Looking at the seasonal activity so far, Hurricane Fred is the season’s sixth named storm and formed on Aug. 30. The average date for the formation of the sixth storm is Sept. 7. The second hurricane of the 2015 season formed on Aug. 31, compared to the average of Aug. 29. While those dates look somewhat “average,” the short duration of those storms means that the total activity for the season is still well below average for this date at just around 58 percent — typical for a strong El Niño, which tends to decrease hurricane activity in the North Atlantic.</td>\n",

       "      <td>LONDON — The European Union began a push Monday for U.N. authorization to deploy military force in the Mediterranean to stop migrant smugglers, even as a proposal to more evenly share the burden of refugees foundered amid intra-European divisions.At U.N. headquarters in New York on Monday, E.U. foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini told the Security Council that the unprecedented flow of migrants seeking to reach Europe by crossing the Mediterranean has necessitated “an exceptional response.”“We cannot do it alone. This has to be a common global effort. That’s why we count on your support to save lives and dismantle criminal organizations that are exploiting people’s desperation,” Mogherini told the 15-nation council.The E.U. proposal would allow the bloc to deploy military force to seize and destroy smugglers’ ships before they take on their human cargo.E.U. leaders see the program as an essential step to curb the dangerous crossings, which have left 1,800 people dead this year as the packed and poorly maintained ships have sunk, run aground or overturned on the high seas. The death toll is 20 times as high as it was at this time last year.But it is unclear whether the E.U. can win Security Council support. Russia has said it opposes any attempt to destroy smugglers’ ships, arguing that the owners in many cases do not know the purpose for which the vessels are being used. Authorities in Libya, the anarchic and divided nation that is the primary source of migrant smuggling, have been either cool to the idea or openly hostile.Rights groups, meanwhile, say that a focus on military action will not solve the crisis, and may make it worse. Amnesty International released a report Monday that described horrendous living conditions for migrants in Libya and concluded that military efforts would “effectively contribute to migrants and refugees being trapped in Libya and expose them to a risk of serious human rights abuses.”The group urged Tunisia and Egypt to open their borders to migrants seeking an escape from Libya, allowing them a safer route out than the one by sea.The E.U. has been roundly criticized for not doing enough to stem the crisis, which is being fed by an exodus of people from Africa and the Middle East fleeing war, poverty and oppression. An Italian-run search-and-rescue mission estimated to have saved more than 100,000 lives was canceled last year. After more than 800 people died in a single shipwreck last month, E.U. officials voted to triple funding for a new maritime patrol mission, though it remains more limited in scope than its predecessor.Meanwhile, an E.U. proposal to more evenly distribute asylum-seekers across Europe appeared to be in trouble Monday, even before it is due to be officially unveiled.The European Commission is expected to release the plan on Wednesday. It calls for establishing E.U.-wide quotas that would dictate the minimum number of asylum-seekers accepted by each of the union’s 28 members. The idea is to ease the burden on front-line states along Europe’s southern periphery, which are suffering under the strain of the tens of thousands of migrants seeking entry. The proposal is strongly backed by those countries and by Germany, which registers more asylum applications than any other nation in Europe.But it has been vigorously opposed by several East European nations, as well as by Britain, where the Conservative government is under intense pressure to limit immigration.A British government spokesman, speaking Monday under customary rules of anonymity, cited previous statements by Prime Minister David Cameron that Britain “would be playing its role in tackling the current crisis in the Mediterranean but that our focus would be on saving lives, not offering people asylum in the U.K.”Read more:U.N. estimates up to 850 migrants perished in capsized boat off LibyaWhy the Mediterranean migrant disaster is a problem for Israel, tooAmid flood of refugees to Europe, Italy opens a back door</td>\n",

       "      <td>With the first presidential debate in the books, here's a look at some key facts and figures that matter from Wednesday night's showdown between President Obama and Mitt Romney: * 3 (Number of minutes more that Obama spoke): CNN ran a clock tracking the total time each candidate spoke during the debate. By its count, Obama spoke for about three minutes more than Romney. Considering that most of the post-debate analysis suggested Romney had the upper hand Wednesday night, it might come as a surprise that Obama actually spoke longer. But Romney kept his responses concise -- a reminder that it candidates can say more with less in debate settings.* 29 (Number of times candidates mention \"middle-class\" or \"middle-income\"): Obama mentioned the words 17 times, and Romney made 12 references. Going into the debate, the burden was on Romney to convince voters he could empathize with average Americans, especially following his \"47 percent\" comment. He delivered, with a memorable line early in the debate; \"Middle-income Americans have seen their income come down by $4,300,\" said Romney \"This is a tax in and of itself. I will call it the economy tax.\"* 52 (Number of times the word \"Medicare\" was uttered): Reminders that disagreements over the future of entitlements remain a central focus in this campaign were everywhere Wednesday, as Obama hit Romney over his plan to revamp Medicare and Romney noted the cuts to the program the president's federal health care law caused. * 0 (Number of times Romney's \"47 percent\" comment came up): Obama notably didn't bring it up, even as his campaign has been running scads of ads hitting Romney over his remarks at a May fundraiser. That doesn't mean Obama won't bash Romney on it at a future debate, but it perhaps does signal that the incumbent didn't want to appear too aggressive (or political) in the first debate. * 2 (Number of times \"leadership\" was raised by the candidates): Each candidate weighed in once on the crucial question of what leadership actually means. Here's what they said: Obama:\"And so part of leadership and governing is both saying what it is that you are for, but also being willing to say no to some things. And I’ve got to tell you, Governor Romney, when it comes to his own party during the course of this campaign, has not displayed that willingness to say no to some of the more extreme parts of his party.\"Romney:\"And Republicans and Democrats both love America. But we need to have leadership -- leadership in Washington that will actually bring people together and get the job done and could not care less if -- if it’s a Republican or a Democrat. I’ve done it before. I’ll do it again.\"</td>\n",

In a news release about the euthanasia decision, Lance Vervoort, Hamilton city council's general manager community, said zoo officials believe the tiger's attack was \"in line with his natural instincts.\"\"We're aware there is a lot of interest and speculation around how we manage Oz now, and I want to assure the public and zoo supporters that he will not be put down,\" Vervoort said in the statement.\"Although there is an inherent risk for zoo professionals who manage big cats like Oz, there is no wider ongoing risk. There is no reason for us to put Oz down.\"Oz is one of five Sumatran tigers at Hamilton Zoo, which will remain closed until Thursday. Visitors to the facility will be able to observe some of the its tigers then, though officials haven't decided whether Oz will be among them.\"This is our call, and the decision on Oz rested solely with us,\" Vervoort said in the release, which noted that government officials have also been notified. \"Oz is a significant animal for his species.\"Sumatran tigers like Oz are considered a \"critically endangered\" species. It's estimated that fewer than 400 of the tigers are surviving in the wild, according to the World Wildlife Fund.In the news release, Vervoort called Oz \"vital\" to the ongoing conservation breeding program for the species.The zoo staffer who was killed, Samantha Kudeweh, was described as a 43-year-old mother of two, who had a considerable amount of experience in her field. Her job at Hamilton involved figuring out which animals the facility should take in and how to care for them, according to her biography on zoo's Web site.The Sydney Morning Herald reported that emergency crews responded to the attack, which is still under investigation, late Sunday morning. According to the newspaper:Senior Sergeant Juliet Burgess, from the Waikato District Command Centre, said \"sadly the staff member who was attacked by the tiger has died at the scene\".\"This is a tragic incident,\" she said.\"It is too early to determine exactly what's happened.\"Officials are \"firmly\" focused on “supporting Samantha’s family, the zoo team, and mak[ing] sure we conduct thorough and complete investigations into this tragic incident,\" Vervoort said in the statement.Read more:Mauling, escapes and abuse: 6 small zoos, 80 sick or dead animalsCubs of a euthanized grizzly that killed a Yellowstone hiker will get a new homeIndiana woman wants to be laid to rest with her German shepherd.

       "      <td>The Food and Drug Administration announced Friday that it is banning the use of several common ingredients in antibacterial soaps and washes. It also said such products were no more effective than conventional soap and water in preventing illnesses and may pose health risks.The rule applies to 19 active ingredients -- including the most common, triclosan and triclocarban -- in liquid soaps, bar soaps and other items. Manufacturers will have one year to remove the ingredients from their products or to take them off the market, the agency said.Triclosan typically is used in liquid antibacterial soaps, while triclocarban is used in bar soaps.\"Consumers may think antibacterial washes are more effective at preventing the spread of germs, but we have no scientific evidence that they are any better than plain soap and water,” said Janet Woodcock, director of the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, said in a statement. “In fact, some data suggests that antibacterial ingredients may do more harm than good over the long-term.”Theresa Michele, FDA's director of the division of nonprescription drug products, said in a call with reporters that the \"vast majority\" of the more than 2,000 antibacterial products on the market contain at least one of the banned ingredients.She said the agency had asked manufacturers for data showing that the long-term use of the ingredients was safe, as well as evidence that the antibacterial products were more effective than soap and water in curbing the spread of illnesses and infections. But she said the companies either didn't provide the data or the material submitted wasn't convincing.An industry group that represents makers of cleaning products disputed that, saying manufacturers had submitted the required information. \"The FDA already has in its hands data that shows the safety and effectiveness of antibacterial soaps,\" the American Cleaning Institute said in a statement. \"Manufacturers are continuing their work to provide even more science and research to fill data gaps identified by FDA.\"The association added that antibacterial soaps and washes \"continue to be safe and effective products for millions of people every single day.\"The FDA's final rule does not affect consumer hand sanitizers, wipes or antibacterial products used in hospitals and other health-care settings. In June, the agency requested data on the safety and effectiveness of certain ingredients in those products, but emphasized it was not barring any of the items at that time.The agency issued a proposed rule in 2013 on antibacterial soaps and washes after data suggested long-term exposure to certain ingredients could cause bacterial resistance and unanticipated hormonal effects.Ken Cook, co-founder and president of Environmental Working Group, praised the FDA decision, saying that the group has been pressing for such action for a decade. “This decision by the FDA is a huge victory on behalf of human health and the environment,” he said.Michele said some manufacturers, including Johnson &amp; Johnson and Procter &amp; Gamble, have already taken steps to phase out use of some of the banned ingredients.The FDA also said that, in response to industry requests, it would defer for a year making a decision on three additional ingredients used in consumer wash products – benzalkonium chloride, benzethonium chloride and chloroxyleno -- to allow manufacturers to submit data to the agency.Read more:The chemistry of deodorantThe FDA takes another step to fight the opioid epidemicHPV vaccination rate surges among teen boys</td>\n",

       "      <td>Raising the flag at the U.S. Embassy in Havana on Aug. 14 was a historically symbolic act, but equally symbolic were the absence of dissidents and the failure to talk about Cuba’s repressive regime at this public moment. The 45-minute ceremony illustrated everything that is wrong with Washington’s Cuba policy.Americans and Cubans who have wanted for decades to hold the island’s dictatorship accountable for its human rights crimes absorbed a tough blow. But if the Obama administration won’t give them the right Cuba policy, Congress can award them an important and symbolic concession: Rub a reminder of the regime’s brutality in its face, every day, by renaming the street where its embassy stands in D.C. after one of its victims, the slain opposition leader Oswaldo Payá.We all want a free, democratic and prosperous Cuba at peace with the United States. But this is not what Fidel and Raúl Castro want. Raul has made it clear that Cuba will remain under the control of the Communist Party and will not change the nature of the regime. As Josefina Vidal, director of U.S. affairs for the Cuban Foreign Ministry, put it: “Decisions on internal matters are not negotiable and will never be put on the negotiating agenda.” This is why the Cuban government refused to offer any meaningful political or economic reforms that might loosen its stranglehold on power, such as democratic elections or the release of all prisoners of conscience.Despite good intentions, the U.S. policy shift morally and financially bolsters the Communist Party and disheartens people — both here and in Cuba — who have fought for freedom and prosperity. America’s recognition of the Castro regime legitimizes the party’s rule and makes continuity of party control more, not less, likely after Raul’s retirement or death. Victims of the Castro regime feel they have lost their staunchest ally, the United States. During an audience with Congress, dissident Jorge Luis Garcia Pérez — commonly known as Antúnez — said the majority of Cuba’s dissidents consider the negotiations between Washington and Havana a betrayal that threatens Cuban people’s aspirations for freedom.People who oppose the rapprochement appear powerless. Easing the embargo bails out the party by letting it broker deals with U.S. corporate investors while choosing which Cubans get to do business with Americans. Tourism dollars coming from the United States will open a new revenue stream for the Cuban military, which owns the largest hotel conglomerate in Latin America and the Caribbean and most of the hotels on the island. Its parent company is run by Castro’s son-in-law, Luis Alberto Rodriguez López-Callejas.The monopoly of power and money that senior Communist Party members enjoy is maintained by repressive measures against ordinary Cubans who dare challenge the ongoing tyranny. According to Amnesty International, Cuba still stifles “freedoms of expression, association and assembly.” The rights group’s investigations reveal that, in the past year, “the number of short-term arrests increased sharply and politically motivated criminal prosecutions continued.” According to a 2013 report by Human Rights Watch, Cuba still condones beatings and arbitrary arrests of its political opponents.Although U.S. Secretary of State John F. Kerry noted last week in Havana that rapprochement “doesn’t mean that we should or will forget the past,” he failed to mention the injustices and the victims of Cuba’s Communist Party. The Castro regime is responsible for the deaths of about 10,000 Cubans. He ignored the dozens of political prisoners still held captive today. These artists, journalists, scholars, religious leaders and dissidents are in prison because their creativity, cause or conscience is deemed a threat by the Castro regime — the longest-running military dictatorship in the Western Hemisphere.To keep the memory of the regime’s victims alive, Congress can rename Washington’s 16th Street Northwest, where the newly reopened embassy sits. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) introduced a bipartisan bill to rename it for Payá, an activist who was expelled from the state-run university in 1972 for practicing Christianity. (Cuba does not condone the free expression of religion.) Payá went on to become one of the most prominent activists for democratization in Cuba and one of the biggest irritants to the Castro regime. You could consider him the Václav Havel of Cuba.On July 22, 2012, Payá was killed in a car accident in the island’s Granma province under mysterious circumstances. The Human Rights Foundation, which conducted an examination of the case, concluded this year that “evidence, which was deliberately ignored, strongly suggests that the events of July 22, 2012, were not an accident, but instead the result of a car crash directly caused by agents of the state.”Renaming the Cuban Embassy’s D.C. address as No. 1 Oswaldo Payá Way would not reverse President Obama’s decision to restore diplomatic relations with Cuba, but it would be a visible reminder that the United States supports the hopes and aspirations of Cuba’s dissidents, too.There is precedent for such a move. In 1984, the U.S. government renamed the street in front of the Russian Embassy for the famed Soviet dissident Andrei Sakharov. The message that the U.S. government intended to send was that we remember those still struggling against oppression and despair in an imprisoned nation, even if we engage in open diplomacy with its government.Cuba could retaliate, of course, by naming the street in front of the newly reopened U.S. Embassy in Havana for the late Venezuelan leader Hugo Chávez or whistleblower Edward Snowden or revolutionary Che Guevara or one of the 70 fugitives from U.S. law still harbored by the regime. But that decision would cast into even sharper relief our governments’ differing values.Neither peaceful relations with Cuba nor a brighter future for the Cuban people will be achieved by ignoring the bloody and ongoing abuses of the Castro regime. This is how to remember them.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Tropical Cyclone Hudhud came ashore in India near the city of Visakhapatnam on Sunday with wind speeds over 100 mph and torrential rain, killing at least eight people in the states of Andhra Predesh and Orissa.According to the Associated Press, at least 400,000 people were evacuated ahead of the storm, and damage in Visakhapatnam was significant:Visakhapatnam, one of the largest cities in southern India and a major naval base, bore the brunt of Hudhud’s fury. Television footage showed downed electrical poles, uprooted trees and debris strewn in the streets. Train and cellphone services were disrupted. Electricity was disconnected in parts of Andhra Pradesh to avoid electrocutions, said Arvind Kumar, a relief and rescue official.Images of the the airport in Visakhapatnam posted to social media shows major damage as a result of the storm: Tropical Cyclone Hudhud went through a period of rapid intensification as it approached the India coast, peaking at the equivalent of a category 4 hurricane with winds of 135 mph, though there is some disagreement on the exact intensity of the cyclone at the time of landfall.The India Meteorological Department says Hudhud made landfall with winds of 109 mph, and India’s Firstpost is praising the department for its exemplary forecast, saying it “has no peer when it comes to forecasting cyclonic storms in the Indian seas.” However, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center analyzed the storm at around 132 mph at the time of landfall. In an interview with the BBC, N Yuvaraj, a senior district official in Visakhapatnam, suggested that wind speeds in the city were closer to JTWC’s forecast. “We had this cyclone hitting us at around 10:25 Indian Standard Time (04:55 GMT),” he said. “And at that point we had a wind speed of more than 205km/h,” which is around 127 mph. It is unclear if these wind speeds were sustained or gusts.Much of the confusion around landfall intensity likely stems from the disagreement between the measuring techniques employed by the different forecasting organizations. While the Joint Typhoon Warning Center uses a widely recognized standard of one-minute sustained winds, the India Meteorological Department uses three-minute sustained winds, making verification between the forecast agencies difficult, especially when local observation data is sparse, and storm-related power outages are widespread.In any case, Hudhud was a powerful, deadly cyclone at landfall. Weather Underground’s director of meteorology Jeff Masters suggests the damage will probably end up looking similar to that of Tropical Cyclone Phailin in 2013:One-minute resolution wind observations from Visakhapatnam showed a peak sustained wind of 73 mph at 9:44 am local time, with a peak gust of 119 mph at 10:30 am. The station stopped reporting data at that time. Communications are out to much of the most severely affected regions, and I expect Hudhud’s eventual toll will be similar to that of Category 4 Tropical Cyclone Phailin, which killed 45 people and did $700 million in damage in October 2013 to an area of India’s coast just north of where Hudhud hit.While Hudhud has moved inland away from the coast on Monday, Andhra Predesh and Orissa will likely see showers and thunderstorms in its wake for the next day or so as the cleanup begins.</td>\n",

       "      <td>A bachelor’s degree in psychology from George Mason University fetched a median starting salary of $30,256 for recent graduates who landed a job in the state. A degree in computer and information sciences from GMU drew $55,213.In both fields, those salaries beat the state average and exceeded what graduates from many other Virginia colleges were earning within 18 months of receiving identical degrees.Those are among the findings from a groundbreaking database Virginia published Thursday that pinpoints for the first time how much graduates from specific college programs, public and private, earn when they enter the job market. That’s a matter of intense interest to many parents and lawmakers in an era of rising student debt and college bills that can total tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars.“Students and their families should have this information at their fingertips so they can make better-informed decisions about where to enroll, what to major in and how much debt they might comfortably take on relative to their likely earnings,” Mark Schneider, vice president of the nonprofit American Institutes for Research, told Congress last month.Virginia’s data initiative has been quietly in the works for a few years. This year, Sens. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) and Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) teamed up on a bill that would help other states link detailed higher education and labor market data and report it to the public. They call it the “Student Right to Know Before You Go Act.” Experts say similar disclosure efforts are underway in Tennessee, Arkansas, Colorado, Nevada and Texas.The data released Thursday by the State Council of Higher Education for Virginia came with plenty of caveats. It did not include salary information for graduates who left the state or got a job in the military or federal government. There were no adjustments for regional differences in the cost of living. Many four-year graduates went on to graduate school instead of seeking a job.Experts cautioned that it can take several years to reveal the earning power of a degree, and that higher education is about far more than a financial return on investment. Still, the data cast a spotlight on a core question: What is a degree worth?For people who earned a bachelor’s degree in business administration at a Virginia college and then obtained a job within the state, part of the answer could lie in their median starting salary. That, according to the state data, which aggregated information for graduates from 2005 to 2010, was $35,565.At Marymount University in Arlington, the median for such graduates was a bit higher: $37,582. Annual tuition at the private school is $24,900.“We’re trying to educate the whole person at Marymount,” said the school’s president, Matt Shank, “so when you look at salary it’s just one sliver of the bigger picture.”Shank, like other college leaders, said students should also factor financial aid into their thinking about value.Peter Stearns, provost of George Mason, said: “My biggest fear is that people would rush to premature conclusions about the value of a particular degree. You sort of want a view that would have whole careers in mind. There’s more to a job than income.”At GMU, a public university, in-state tuition is $9,420.Several educators said they worried that the publication of salary data would give potential applicants a misleading picture of schools. “It’s hard not to make judgments when you look at raw data like that,” said Tracy Fitzsimmons, president of Shenandoah University in Winchester. “I wouldn’t want students and their parents to choose an educational institution, or even a career, based solely on projected earnings.”The data show that median starting salaries for recent graduates with Shenandoah bachelor’s degrees ranged from $21,143 (environmental studies) to $47,148 (respiratory care therapy). Annual tuition at the private school is $27,550.At the University of Mary Washington in Fredericksburg, the chief of staff to President Richard V. Hurley said he didn’t know what to make of the data.“I was a history major,” said Martin Wilder. “How about you?” For those with a bachelor’s degree in history from the school, the median starting salary was $28,403. The public university’s in-state tuition is $4,686.The Virginia database grew out of a movement to trace the path of individual students from elementary school through college, what is known as a “longitudinal data system.” In recent years, state officials also have conferred about how to link education data with employment and wage records gathered for the state unemployment insurance program. They came up with a solution that stripped the merged records of identifying individual information to protect the privacy of students, graduates and employees.This year, the state legislature passed a law requiring annual publication of the wage and degree data.The state higher education council consulted extensively with college leaders to assuage their concerns. Caveats and provisos about the wage and salary information are displayed prominently on the Web site.“The more we talk to them, the more at ease they seem to be with it,” said Kirsten Nelson, a spokeswoman for the council.Grover “Russ” Whitehurst, a Brookings Institution analyst who was a senior education official in George W. Bush’s administration, said the publication of labor market data linked to colleges is overdue and is more important to applicants than indicators such as graduation rates or admissions selectivity.“The most important thing government can do to increase productivity and innovation in higher education is to let people actually shop,” Whitehurst said. “It is revolutionary.”</td>\n",

       "      <td>Already, 23 states allow marijuana to be prescribed for medicinal use, making it easy for proponents for broader legalization, such as the Marijuana Policy Project, to brand the drug as “harmless.” Some go further, calling it “safe” and even “healthy.” The result is that voters in Oregon and Alaska — in addition to D.C. — may soon join Colorado and Washington as the first states to fully legalize recreational pot for adults.The problem is that marijuana is not, in fact, “harmless.” (Update: After publication, the Marijuana Policy Project altered the language on its site to call pot “a much less harmful substance” than alcohol. Here is a screenshot of the original.) Proponents are spinning the science — casting pot as a threat only if used improperly, much like a car — for the sake of advancing their political agenda. It’s fine for people to believe the government has no business conducting a “war on drugs,” but it’s something else entirely to trivialize or simply deny marijuana’s harmful effects. These dangers are real, according to a recently released comprehensive review of 20 years of scientific literature from Wayne Hall, who advises the World Health Organization on addiction and runs the University of Queensland’s Center for Youth Substance Abuse Research. And the dangers need to be dealt with.The role of government in regulating drugs can’t be separated from what those drugs do to people. On that question, pot-libertarians have taken too many liberties — about both its medical and its recreational effects.Proponents claim marijuana can slow or stop damage caused by glaucoma (by lowering eye pressure), but as Henry D. Jampel, professor of ophthalmology at Johns Hopkins, points out, marijuana could actually worsen the vision loss caused by glaucoma. “Although marijuana does lower the eye pressure, it also lowers blood pressure,” he notes. “Lower blood pressure could result in reduced blood supply to the optic nerve, which in turn might harm the optic nerve.”Beyond the medical applications, legalization proponents argue that marijuana should be available for recreational use because it’s “harmless” and not addictive. But the active ingredient in marijuana, THC, is a powerful psychoactive ingredient that can cause hallucinations or delusions and interfere with the way the brain makes and stores memories. Hall’s study found that marijuana use doubles the risk of developing psychotic disorders, including schizophrenia. He also found that one in 10 adults who regularly smoke the drug become dependent on it, and those who use it are more likely to go on to use harder drugs.His study also emphasizes the danger that marijuana use poses to teens — one in six teenagers who regularly smoke pot will become dependent. Other research backs up these warnings: A recent review of more than 120 studies found that teen marijuana use is associated with subsequent addiction to other drugs and psychosis, such as schizophrenia. And a recent study from researchers at the University of Wisconsin at Milwaukee linked regular marijuana use by teens to drops in IQ points and to memory problems.While the states that have legalized marijuana completely have done so only for residents 21 and older, peer-reviewed research has linked heavy marijuana use with long-term memory problems and other health effects in adults. Marijuana also poses dangers to pregnant women, with studies linking the drug to lower birth weight, impaired brain development and behavior problems in adolescents.And while proponents of legalization point out that it’s impossible to overdose on cannabis, that doesn’t mean there aren’t any instances of marijuana-related deaths. A handful of deaths in Denver were tied to edible marijuana use this year, not to mention the increased risk of fatal car accidents due to drivers impaired by marijuana. Hall’s study analyzed epidemiological studies and laboratory evidence from a number of researchers and concluded that driving after smoking pot approximately doubles the risk of a car crash.Because marijuana has been illegal for decades, intensive studies are lacking and there are still many questions surrounding the safety of marijuana. Hall’s report is a meta-analysis of available research on marijuana, but much of the work on marijuana’s effects has focused on heavy, long-term users or vulnerable populations, including teenagers and pregnant women. We need more research on the effect of marijuana on casual users.As more states move to legalize marijuana, polls indicate that Americans are growing much more accepting of marijuana use. But the growing acceptance and availability of pot, along with the misleading advertisements spread by legalization proponents, are spreading the dangerous myth that marijuana is risk-free. There are compelling reasons to change our policy toward marijuana — notably, cutting down on incarceration rates for possession. But simply ignoring the science on the negative effects of chronic (no pun intended) marijuana use does a disservice to the dialogue around marijuana.</td>\n",

       "      <td>America is getting less white a lot faster than the Republican Party. That trend threatens to be a problem over the long term for the GOP.When Donald Trump told an interviewer last week that Republicans would never win another election if Hillary Clinton triumphed in November, we took a look at the heart of his claim. Clinton would give blanket citizenship to millions of immigrants, Trump asserted, throwing elections to her party thanks to all those new Hispanic voters. But we pointed out that the demographics of the country are already headed that way.New data from Pew Research makes this point more clearly by looking at past trends.Since 1992, Pew estimates that the density of nonwhite voters in the Republican Party has doubled from 7 to 14 percent. In the Democratic Party, the increase has been a bit less than double — but it's substantially larger as a percentage of the party. The density of nonwhite voters in the Republican Party in 2016 is still only a little more than half what it was for the Democrats 24 years ago.But the density of nonwhite voters in the electorate has just about doubled, too. The Democratic Party is getting less white faster than the voting population; the GOP is getting less white a lot more slowly.The GOP is now about as diverse as the electorate was when Bill Clinton first won the presidency.What's happened to the GOP, as my colleague Aaron Blake wrote on Tuesday, is that it has increasingly become the domain of older white men without college degrees. (In 1992, 38 percent of Republicans were 50 or older; in 2016, the figure is 58 percent.) The graph at the top of this post suggests that this might be less of a problem for the party, given that the number of older whites in the population will also increase.The challenge is that younger white voters — the people who will be 65 by 2060 — are more likely to identify as Democrats than older whites.White millennials (defined by Pew as being born in 1981 or later) identify with or lean toward both parties equally. Among Gen Xers (born 1965 to 1980), the GOP has a 15-point advantage. Among boomers, it's 20 points. Millennials who aren't white are also more likely to be Democratic by a wide margin but with less of a difference from older nonwhite voters.There's some variation in party identities over time, but the Democrats are starting from a position of advantage. Research suggests that political beliefs usually form early, with events by the age of 18 being more influential than events later in life. All of which suggests that the tie ballgame with white voters coupled with the wide Democratic advantage among nonwhites as the electorate grows less white is a significant long-term problem for the Republican Party.Political parties can change (which helps drive some of that movement in the charts above). We remember that the GOP outlined a plan to reach out to Hispanic voters after Mitt Romney's loss in 2012. The only problem was that the existing base wasn't enthusiastic about it, so much so that the current Republican nominee is much more fervently opposed to immigration reform than Romney was.An optimistic way to look at that: Things can change fast. This should offer the GOP some reassurance.</td>\n",

       "      <td>On Thursday, millions of Americans became eligible to take advantage of the government’s most generous student loan repayment plan.The repayment program, known as Revised Pay as You Earn or REPAYE, caps borrowers’ monthly bills to 10 percent of their income and forgives the debt after 20 years of payment. Up until now, those terms were only available for people with especially low income relative to their debt and who took out their loans after 2007. But the Obama administration opened the program to anyone with what’s known as a Direct federal loan, regardless of their income or when they borrowed.[The Obama administration’s plan to lower the student debt payments of millions more Americans]All income-driven plans are designed to prevent people from defaulting on their student loans, which can severely damage a person’s credit rating and make it much harder to buy a car or a house. Still, these plans are not for everyone. And before enrolling in the latest one, there are a few things to consider. Let’s start with the basics:Eligible loans: All Direct federal loans, as long as they are not in default, are eligible for the new plan. As you might recall, the government decided in 2010 to only lend directly to borrowers, rather than backing loans originated by banks and other financial firms. At the time, the government had a small direct lending portfolio that has since tripled in size. If you have one of those old bank-based loans from the Federal Family Education Loan Program (FFEL) or a Perkins loans, you can consolidate that debt into a Direct loan to take advantage of REPAYE. Parent PLUS loans are not eligible for this program.Monthly payments: The calculation is based on your discretionary income, or whatever you earn above 150 percent of the federal poverty line ($17,655 for a single person). If you make $30,000, for instance, your discretionary income would be $12,345. That means your monthly loan payments would initially be capped at $102.88. If your income is very low, you may not have to pay anything until your paycheck increases.You have to update your financial information every year, so the more you make the more you will pay. Keep in mind that depending on how your paycheck changes over time, you may wind up paying more than you would under the 10-year standard repayment plan. Check out the Department of Education’s repayment estimator to get a sense of what you will be doling out.[There’s a way to dramatically lower student debt payments, but hardly anyone uses it]Debt forgiveness: If after 20 years of making payments on your undergraduate loans, you’re still carrying a balance, the remaining money will be wiped away. Here’s the thing, the Internal Revenue Service will treat that sum as taxable income, unless Congress changes the current rules, according to the National Foundation for Credit Counseling. Let’s say you have a $10,000 balance forgiven. That money will be tacked onto your income, which could put you in a higher tax bracket and leave you susceptible to paying Uncle Sam more money.Credit: The Institute for College Access &amp; SuccessAlready in an income-driven plan: You can switch into REPAYE, even if you’re enrolled in one of the older income-driven plans (there are four others). Keep in mind, however, any unpaid interest will be added to your loan principal, causing interest to accrue on a higher loan balance, according to the Institute for College Access and Success. And if you consolidate you old bank-based loans to get into REPAYE, any previous payments you made while enrolled in income-based repayment will not count toward the period of time needed to qualify for forgiveness.Graduate debt terms: Anyone who borrowed for graduate school will have to make payments for 25 years, five years longer than everyone else, to have their remaining balance forgiven. The stipulation is meant to lower the ultimate cost of forgiving the debt of grad students, who tend to borrow more.Matrimony penalty: Married borrowers can no longer lower their payments by excluding their spouse’s income, unless they are separated or victims of domestic abuse.Signing up: You’ve got two options here. You can apply online at www.studentloans.gov, where you may be able to electronically upload your tax return information. Or you can ask your student loan servicer, the middlemen that collect and apply your payments, for a paper application.What to learn more about income-driven repayment?

       "      <td>Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx stepped up his pressure on Metro to improve its safety performance Thursday by replacing three members of the transit agency’s board with experienced transportation-safety professionals.Foxx, who has been frustrated by the delay in creating a new Metro safety oversight office, made clear in a written announcement that his impatience was growing with the agency and the three local jurisdictions that help govern it.“Given the continued urgency, we will be forced to use every available lever at our discretion to force action as soon as possible to improve safety for the traveling public,” Foxx said. “No more excuses.”In a timely reminder of the problems that Foxx wants addressed, Metro announced a four-day service slowdown along part of the Red Line so work crews can carry out what the agency called a “maintenance surge.”The repair effort follows several days of Red Line disruptions between the Van Ness-UDC and Medical Center stations — including an emergency evacuation of train passengers Saturday night because of an electrical problem that caused smoke in a tunnel.[Metro sank into crisis despite decades of warnings.]The three new federal board members, who will take office June 1, are Carol Carmody, former vice chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board; David Strickland, former administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration; and Robert Lauby, chief safety officer of the Federal Railroad Administration.They will replace Mortimer Downey, who recently completed a term as board chairman; Harriet Tregoning, a senior official at the Department of Housing and Urban Development: and Anthony R. Giancola, former executive director of the National Association of County Engineers.Foxx praised the outgoing directors for their “excellent service,” but there was no mistaking his desire to force change on the board so Metro would deal more aggressively with safety.Despite decades of warnings from the federal government and others, Metro has failed to instill a safety-first mind-set in its workforce and allowed its equipment to deteriorate so much that it sometimes endangers riders.“Building a safety culture is not easy and requires relentless focus at every level,” Foxx wrote. “These three new Federal members will build on our promise to bring a laser-like focus on making the transit system of our nation’s capital as safe as possible.”Foxx’s action comes at a time of increased scrutiny of Metro’s governing structure, which has long been blamed as a contributor to the agency’s difficulties.A few hours after the announcement, Rep. John Delaney (D-Md.) filed a bill in the House that would require three of the federal government’s four board appointees to be certified as experts in transportation, management, finance or safety.Delaney said it appeared that the three new members meet his bill’s standards, but he still wanted the requirements codified into law.The bill also provides that if the Metro Compact — the agency’s governing document — is amended, then the same standards would apply to members appointed by the three local jurisdictions that also govern Metro. The District, Virginia and Maryland each appoint four board members.The Metro board chairman, Jack Evans, was cool to the bill, suggesting that Congress would do better to give Metro more money.“It’s an interesting bill [but] I don’t know that having any kind of background in transit or other things is necessary to be a board member,” Evans said, noting that he would be precluded from serving on the board. A lawyer by training, Evans has been a D.C. Council member for 25 years, representing Ward 2.Evans has been pressing Congress to give Metro $300 million a year — approximately what each of the three local jurisdictions contributes — to help the agency cover its annual operational deficit.“Here’s what I would say. .?.?. I would ask every member of Congress who wants to help to get me my $300 million. .?.?. Don’t introduce [a] bill to change the chairs on the deck of the Titanic,” Evans said. “Congressman Delaney, congressman whoever — here, there and everywhere — help me get my $300 million. I can’t tell you anything that’s more critical to the agency.”Foxx has taken an unusually hands-on approach to safety at Metro.In October, following a series of high-profile safety lapses, Foxx announced that the Federal Transit Administration would take responsibility for safety oversight of Metro’s rail system. The move was recognition that the current regional safety agency, the Tri-State Oversight Committee had largely failed in its job.Foxx also has kept the pressure on leaders in the District, Maryland and Virginia to set up a replacement body. He has threatened to withhold federal funds if they fail to act by the end of this year.Thursday’s appointments also might be seen as an effort to blunt criticism from the NTSB, which is expected to release its report on the fatal 2015 Yellow Line smoke incident early next month.Of the new board members, Carmody and Strickland will be voting members. Lauby will be an alternate, who votes only when one of the two federal voting members is absent.The fourth current federal representative, Anthony E. Costa, an alternate member, remains on the board.The most prominent member to exit the board is Downey, a former U.S. deputy secretary of transportation. He said he did not view his replacement as a rebuke of his performance in six years on the Metro board.He said he talked with Foxx about it and the secretary “says it is not in his view that this is taking any objection to anything I’ve done.”Instead, Downey said, “they’re doing what they think is necessary, and they’re looking for results.”During the maintenance work on the Red Line, trains share one track between Van Ness and Medical Center on Thursday and Friday from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m., and from 8 p.m. to midnight; and all day and night over the weekend.Because of the single-tracking, wait times between trains will be extended by at least 20 minutes.Metro General Manager Paul J. Wiedefeld said the repairs were necessary in part because that section of the subway is especially deep and has long been plagued by moisture seeping in from the ground.Lori Aratani contributed to this report.</td>\n",

       "      <td>By the time 18-year-old Aaron Young wound up at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center in Los Angeles last October, he’d been wrestling for months with excruciating stomach pain and vomiting that repeatedly sent him to the emergency room.Diagnosed with acute pancreatitis, he underwent what is typically a low-risk procedure in which doctors inserted a special device down his throat to treat his digestive system.But instead of recovering, Young developed a raging bacterial infection and a relentless 104-degree fever. He recovered after nearly three months in the hospital but had to return for another procedure in late January. The infection flared anew, and he is now likely to be in the hospital for at least another month, his family says.Young is among seven patients at UCLA who were infected with a hard-to-treat “superbug” that hospital officials traced to two specialized scopes that they said were contaminated despite being thoroughly cleaned. Two of the patients later died, and scores more were potentially exposed.After the incident became public, the Food and Drug Administration warned that the devices, called duodenoscopes, can be difficult to sanitize and “may facilitate the spread of deadly bacteria.”Now medical experts and lawmakers want to know why the FDA and the manufacturers of the devices — all of which have been aware of the potential problem for years — didn’t move more quickly and aggressively to ensure patient safety.The urgency around the issue intensified Wednesday after Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles disclosed that four patients who underwent endoscopic procedures had been infected by the same germ as at UCLA: a drug-resistant form of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, or CRE. [FDA warns about medical scopes after ‘superbug’ hits California hospital] Hartford Hospital in Connecticut said Wednesday that 281 patients were possibly exposed during the same type of procedure to a strain of E. coli. Young’s family, meanwhile, has sued Olympus Corp., the manufacturer of the device involved in the UCLA case, on his behalf, alleging fraud and negligence. The suit claims the company didn’t provide updated cleaning protocols to hospitals when it introduced a newer version of the device in 2010.“The lawsuit is almost beside the point,” said Lori Smith, Aaron’s adoptive mother and herself a registered nurse, in her first interview on the matter. “We’d just like them to do something so that people are better informed. Nobody said Aaron could get something from these scopes that could kill him. .?.?. We just had no idea.”The family of Antonia Torres Cerda, a 48-year-old woman who died in November after apparently being exposed to a contaminated duodenoscope at the hospital, has sued the company for wrongful death. Cerda underwent the endoscopy procedure before receiving a liver transplant.An Olympus spokesman said the company “does not comment on active legal matters or speculation” but added that it “continuously strives to improve our products for safe and effective use.”‘Why did it take so long?’For years, the FDA has received warnings — from hospitals, from clinicians, and from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — about possible links between the duodenoscopes and the spread of deadly infections. The devices are used in a procedure known as ERCP, or endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, on roughly 500,000 patients annually in the United States. They are considered a critical tool in diagnosing and treating cancers, gallstones and other ailments of the digestive system in a minimally invasive way. [California public health officials are tracking down 179 patients after superbug deaths] The general public may not have known about the small but serious risks associated with bacteria harbored in duodenoscopes, but some medical experts have been flagging the problem for decades.“We have known about this even as early as 1983 or 1984,” said John Allen, a professor at the Yale School of Medicine who is president of the American Gastroenterological Association. In 1987, Allen wrote in an academic journal about 10 of his patients in Minnesota mysteriously becoming infected with a bacteria known as Pseudomonas. He and his colleagues traced the infections to a single duodenoscope, whose small crevices harbored bacteria despite repeated cleanings.In 2009, after a dozen patients in France were infected with drug-resistant bacteria linked to a contaminated duodenoscope, the FDA, the CDC and the Department of Veterans Affairs warned hospitals and other medical facilities about the risk of cross-contamination if scopes weren’t properly cleaned and sterilized. That warning applied to all medical scopes, not just duodenoscopes.But since 2012, infections linked to duodenoscopes have occurred at Advocate Lutheran General Hospital near Chicago, where 44 people were infected, and at the Virginia Mason Medical Center in Seattle, where at least 32 patients became ill and 11 died. It’s unclear how significant a role the CRE bacteria played in those deaths.Over the years, Allen said, experts responded to outbreaks by adding another cleaning step, such as flushing the devices with alcohol. The latest outbreak “reemphasizes the fact that we haven’t solved the fundamental problem,” which he said ultimately could boil down to a design flaw.During the past two years, the FDA has received at least 75 reports about the devices, involving at least 135 patients, and those numbers may be low given that many such events don’t get reported. In 2013, the agency said, it received notice from the CDC about a possible association between the complex devices and multi-drug-resistant bacteria. Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) last month wrote to FDA Commissioner Margaret Hamburg, urging the agency to publicly address the issue.“The big question is, why did it take so long?” said John Greene, an infectious-disease doctor at Moffitt Cancer Center in Florida, who in 2013 co-authored an article about an outbreak involving duodenoscopes in Tampa. “It’s a very fair question. .?.?. Unfortunately, things don’t happen until bad outcomes occur.”Ten House members are asking similar questions. In a letter Wednesday to the FDA, they wrote, “The alarming spread of superbug outbreaks across the country demands a forceful, substantive response from the federal government.” One of the letter’s authors, Rep.

He said agency officials had become especially concerned about the 2013 Illinois infections because there were no obvious sterilization lapses and because the devastating CRE bacteria was becoming more common across the country.The agency redoubled its efforts, scouring medical research and adverse events reports to try to answer several critical questions: Are existing disinfection procedures sufficient? If not, what are the alternatives? Is the problem unique to one model or manufacturer?

       "      <td>People who carry a gene for sickle cell disease might not have an elevated mortality risk, according to a study released today in the New England Journal of Medicine.Sickle cell disease occurs in 1 out of every 365 black people born in America, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. They carry two copies of a gene for sickle cell disease. Those who carry only one copy of the gene are said to have sickle cell trait. About 1 in 13 black Americans have sickle cell trait. An earlier study found that sickle cell trait may lead to an increased risk of sudden death, but the new study comes to a different conclusion.Sickle cell disease causes red blood cells to be misshapen and can lead to lifelong pain and a reduced lifespan. It wasn't clear whether sickle cell trait is dangerous.Researchers at Stanford University Medical Center found that there seemed to be no significant difference in death risk for people with sickle cell trait compared to those without it. However, carriers of the sickle cell trait were more likely to develop exertional rhabdomyolysis, a breakdown of skeletal muscle tissue caused by strenuous exercise.Stanford researchers reviewed the health records of 47,944 black soldiers with known sickle cell status who served between 2011 and 2014. The records were from the Stanford Military Data Repository data set, a digital archive of health encounters at military and civilian medical institutions. The records also include basic health information and certified records of physical performance and mortality of all active duty U.S. Army soldiers.Gender, age and lifestyle factors also affected who experienced exertional rhabdomyolysis. Women had a significantly lower rate compared to men, and soldiers over 36 saw a 57 percent heightened risk for exertional distress. Risk for exercise-related muscle breakdown was also significantly higher in soldiers who had obesity, smoked or took anti-psychotic drugs.Lianne Kurina, one of the lead researchers of the study, said the findings could indicate that perhaps the focus shouldn’t be on sickle cell trait, but other factors that lead to rhabdomyolysis. “There are a lot of factors that should be considered,” she said. “Sickle cell trait is a non-modifiable risk factor. Some of these factors are modifiable.”Rakhi Naik, a certified hematologist at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, said that the study’s findings are exciting.“One thing that’s the most important is that there have been these mandated screenings” for sickle cell trait, she said. The Army, Navy and NCAA now test for sickle cell trait. People who test positive for the gene are warned against dehydration and overheating. “The major point of this study is that it seems that the risk of death can be completely eliminated by hydration.”Kurina also said that increased awareness about hydration and overheating might have contributed to the reason why there isn't an increase in mortality among soldiers with sickle cell trait.She hopes the research will also promote further discussion about screening for sickle cell trait.A 1987 study reported a 2,800 percent increase in the risk of exertion-induced sudden deaths among black recruits thought to have sickle cell trait. That study helped lead to more screening. The new study pointed out that the sickle cell status of every person in the past study wasn’t known.Kurina said knowing the sickle cell status of everyone involved in her research was crucial to her team’s findings. “This is really the first time where people have this population where high numbers of people have been tested,” she said.</td>\n",

       "      <td>The creation of a radioactive tracer can take two to three years of intensive laboratory work.The first step is to find a molecular target — a biomarker associated with a specific cancer. Past chemical studies are then searched for compounds that might bind uniquely to the biomarker. These potential tracers are then modified to be compatible with the technology that would monitor the chemical in the body.They also must be modified so they will not degrade, once injected in a patient, before a scan is taken. The tracer is then tested on animals (usually mice) to see whether it remains active long enough for imaging to occur and whether it is excreted before it can harm the body. The better the design of the tracer, the more successful it will be in highlighting the features of the tumor.Patients considering molecular imaging treatment are sometimes offered entry into clinical trials. It is important to know that, whereas most experimental chemotherapy drugs have significant side effects, “the immediate risk from molecular imaging is virtually zero,” according to Peter Herscovitch, president of the Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging. That is because the number of molecules of radioactive material is tiny, he says.Related: A better way to diagnose and treat cancer</td>\n",

       "      <td>Does Europe need another week full of panic? Not really. But that seems to be on order anyway. Spain's borrowing costs are already rocketing to unsustainable levels as investors worry that the world's eleventh-largest economy is mired in endless recession with no chance to ease its debt burden. And, if that wasn't enough, there's now renewed chatter that Greece might get kicked out of the euro zone.Greece's problems look severe. To date, the country has received pledges of €240 billion ($291 billion) in rescue aid from the European Community, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund. In return for that assistance, however, Greece was supposed to whittle its debts down to 120 percent of GDP by 2020.It's never been clear what the rationale behind this target was. At the time it was proposed, many economists called it arbitrary and unrealistic. Greece is already trapped in one of the worst depressions in modern history. The government is under intense public pressure to ease up on the €12 billion in planned tax hikes and spending cuts in 2012. What were the odds that Greece would ever meet this goal?Yet IMF and European officials declared the 120 percent target sacrosanct. And it could prove fatal for Greece. Over the weekend, Der Spiegel quoted a few anonymous E.U. officials who agreed that there was no way Greece would hit its debt targets. In that case, the Greek government will likely need another €10 billion or €50 billion of aid just to stay afloat. But according to Der Spiegel, neither Germany nor the IMF appear willing to open the spigots again. Here's one quote:The Süddeutsche Zeitung cited an unnamed German government source as saying it was \"inconceivable that Chancellor Angela Merkel would again ask German parliament for approval for a third Greece bailout package.\"And here's a quote from Germany's economic minister (who also happens to be vice-chancellor under Angela Merkel):Meanwhile, German Economy Minister Philipp Rösler said on Sunday he was \"more than skeptical\" that Greece's reform efforts will succeed. \"If Greece no longer meets its requirements there can be no further payments,\" he said in an interview with German public broadcaster ARD. \"For me, a Greek exit has long since lost its horrors.\"The IMF and euro zone will make a decision on further aid in August, but does this sound like a country that wants to make things work? Some German newspapers are rejoicing at the latest hard line. Here's the Bild: \"At last! This signal was overdue. Greece is neither able nor willing to solve its problems.\"The center-left paper Süddeutsche Zeitung, meanwhile, looked at the practical results. If the IMF and Europe refuse to extend further aid, then Greece will have to declare itself insolvent by September. At that point, the European Central Bank will have to decide whether to shut off financing for Greece. If it does, Greek Prime Minister Antonio Samaras will be forced to find a new currency. \"Such a step,\" the newspaper concluded, \"would entail incalculable risks for the Greek government. ... But it will probably have to embark on this adventure.\" (Those \"incalculable risks,\" by the way, include a potential 50 percent drop in Greece's GDP in the first year alone.)Of course, if Greece exits the euro, everyone will start worrying that Spain or Italy could be next. Investors could start betting on a Spanish exit, which would risk becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy. Which means the euro zone will likely need a bigger bailout fund to quell any panic. But Europe's new €500 billion ($605 billion) European Stability Mechanism won't be ready until at least mid-September, when Germany's constitutional court decides whether or not to block the fund's creation. Without that fund, a Greek exit might not be so horror-free after all.Related: FAQ: Why is Greece in such trouble? And can it be fixed?</td>\n",

Numbers of the two-horned descendants of Ice Age woolly rhinos have fallen by some 90 percent since the mid-1980s, when humans began to clear their Southeast Asia forest habitat and poachers started seeking their prized horns.Cincinnati’s zoo has been a pioneer in breeding the species, producing the first three born in captivity in modern times. Harapan will join the eldest, Andalas, who has been in Indonesia since 2007 and has produced one male offspring. Andalas will turn 14 next month.“We are very sad about the [Sumatran rhino] program coming to an end here in Cincinnati,” said Terri Roth, the longtime head of the zoo’s Center for Conservation and Research of Endangered Wildlife. “It’s a huge loss for us.

       "      <td>DETROIT— With General Motors under intense scrutiny for failing to repair a defect the automaker has linked to 12 deaths, chief executive Mary T. Barra appointed a top executive Tuesday to oversee global vehicle safety.Barra said the new executive vice president, 40-year GM employee Jeffrey Boyer, will be in charge of new-car safety as well as all safety recalls. She said the new post “elevates and integrates our safety process under a single leader so we can set a new standard for customer safety with more rigorous accountability.”Barra, speaking Tuesday to reporters at the company’s headquarters overlooking the Detroit River, said the appointment is one of several steps that GM is taking to tighten its oversight of vehicle safety.“We want to make sure this problem never happens again,” Barra said.The appointment comes during an unfolding scandal over GM’s failure to fix ignition switches that if jostled or weighted with too many keys could cause cars to stall, disabling their air bags. So far, the problem has been officially linked by the company to 31 accidents and 12 deaths. Last month, the automaker recalled 1.6 million Chevrolet Cobalts and five other vehicle models.GM has told safety regulators that it fielded complaints about the problem as early as 2001. But the company said it could not pinpoint the problem and did not issue a recall until last month.The Boyer appointment comes a day after the automaker announced three more recalls, unrelated to the faulty ignition switch.The long inaction on the ignition switch has made the company the focus of investigations by two congressional committees and federal safety regulators. The company is also the subject of a preliminary inquiry by federal prosecutors who are considering a criminal investigation, according to people familiar with the matter.The House Energy and Commerce Committee, one of the congressional panels preparing for hearings, met Tuesday with GM officials, mainly to review the automaker’s version of events, as laid out in chronologies filed with federal regulators, company officials said. Barra said that she would testify if summoned by Congress to Capitol Hill.Barra has named a former federal prosecutor to lead an internal investigation that could stretch over months to establish a more precise record of “what went wrong and why,” Barra said. “There are no sacred cows,” she said.Barra was noncommittal when asked whether she would waive the immunity GM enjoys from liability claims predating its 2009 bankruptcy and federal bailout. The internal investigation will provide GM with a baseline of facts to guide the company as it moves forward, she said.Vehicle safety advocates have called on GM, whose profits have soared and standing with car buyers has improved since a restructuring, to establish a $1 billion fund to compensate the families of those killed and injured in incidents related to the defective part.GM has paid settlements in several lawsuits over the switch, but it has not released a comprehensive list of such lawsuits or a list of names of those it believes were hurt and killed as a result of the defect.In her remarks to reporters, Barra repeated her apology for the problem and promised to work diligently to resolve it. She also said that repairs resulting from the ignition switch recall should begin by mid-April and be completed by October.The debacle has posed a difficult early test for Barra, who took over as chief executive of GM in January. She said that she first learned of the problem when the company decided in late January that a recall was warranted.Since then, she has pledged GM’s cooperation with the investigations and apologized repeatedly for the deaths and injuries related to the defective ignition switches.“This is a big crisis, and it is going to go on for a while,” said Dan Hill, president of Ervin Hill Strategy, a crisis public relations firm. “They are going to be fighting battles on many fronts. But GM is taking it seriously. They are showing contrition, and the CEO is engaged.”Barra said she is confident that the recalled cars are safe to drive as long as drivers remove all other items from the vehicles’ key rings. She said that if owners are uncomfortable driving the recalled models, dealers will provide them with loaners and rentals. She also reiterated GM’s pledge to reimburse dealers for the cost of providing those cars.The models recalled by GM because of the ignition switch problem are: 2005-07 Cobalts and Pontiac G5s; 2003-07 Saturn Ion compacts; and 2006-07 Chevrolet HHRs, Pontiac Solstices and Saturn Skys.Related:Watchdog group says review identified 303 deaths in GM cars with undeployed air bagsGM announces 3 new recalls, takes $300 million charge</td>\n",

       "      <td>WITH EACH announcement and every new revelation, federal transportation officials expose the depths to which Metro’s safety standards have fallen. There are a dozen or so major subway systems across the nation, but only for Metro has the Federal Transit Administration assumed full safety oversight and undertaken a “track integrity safety blitz,” which, having been underway since March, continues to yield unsettling maintenance problems ignored or overlooked by Metro itself.Now comes the National Transportation Safety Board with an assessment that the FTA itself is unequal to the task of ensuring Metrorail’s safety. So not only is Metro unsafe, says the NTSB’s chairman, Christopher Hart, but also its federal overseers are inept — “averse to crafting and enforcing safety regulations and minimum requirements regarding operations, track and equipment and signal and train control systems.” He believes only the Federal Railroad Administration has the competence and muscle to implant a culture of safety at Metro.The NTSB, which is in charge of major accident investigations, delivered its report Tuesday on the L’Enfant Plaza smoke incident of January 2015, which left one passenger dead and scores sickened. For passengers, the report — which details a layered systemic breakdown in the L’Enfant Plaza accident — is the latest blow to whatever confidence remains in Metro.Mr. Hart’s scathing critique notwithstanding, the FTA’s revelations may serve at least one important function: to buy Metro some time, or at least indulgence, to start to drag itself back into some semblance of good repair, a process likely to take years. Passengers who may have howled at single-tracking and other schedule-busting maintenance projects a year or two ago might now forgive quotidian inconveniences on the logic that between delays and derailment, delays look like the better option.A less sanguine scenario is that the findings of federal inspectors — defective rails; red-light-running train operators; trains parked without basic safety precautions to prevent them from rolling down the track — may hasten Metro’s already alarming loss of passengers.Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx is aware of Metro’s underlying problems, namely its unwieldy, possibly unworkable governance structure and unmet liabilities running to billions of dollars. He reckons that fixing those is a non-starter before Metro starts to show improved safety. Hence his focus on the system’s safety shortcomings, with the attendant drama of FTA’s track inspection “blitz.”It’s pleasant to think that a short-term benefit of the “blitz” would be a sense of alarm among lawmakers and officials in Annapolis, Richmond and the District, who, having failed to meet the challenge for decades, are now charged with establishing a permanent safety oversight commission for Metro. Instead, there has been nothing but torpor from Metro’s three local stakeholders. Understandably, the NTSB doubts the localities are up to the job. But the FTA, which has been performing that role on an emergency basis since last fall, is not meant to do it indefinitely.Metro is an orphan, and it is sick. Mr. Foxx has been ringing the alarm after years of official neglect and lack of accountability. Bravo, but alarm-ringing may not be enough.</td>\n",

       "      <td>After days of dire warning, the densely populated Eastern Seaboard felt the first bite of a massive storm that snapped trees, ripped down power lines and flooded streets across the Washington region on Monday.From North Carolina to New England, the coastal states were buttoned up as the big and uniquely formed storm system gained its first hold over land since killing almost 70 people in the Caribbean.New York City was hit hard, with an unprecedented nine-foot storm surge conspiring with rivers already overflowing their banks. Streets flooded in Brooklyn and Lower Manhattan, runways at LaGuardia International Airport were underwater and a big construction crane snapped atop a skyscraper being built in Midtown. Four feet of water had flooded some city subways, raising fears they would cripple the system for days.Late Monday, Mayor Michael Bloomberg said backup power had been lost at New York University hospital and the city was working to move people out, the Associated Press reported. The storm had killed at least one city resident, a man who died when a tree fell on his home in the Flushing section of Queens, according to the wire service.With the storm expected to linger longer than most, virtually everything in and around Washington was to shut down for a second day on Tuesday. The federal workforce and public employees in the District, Maryland and Virginia were told to stay home again. Schools in the District and adjoining states closed. Metro and other transit agencies planned to remain out of service at least Tuesday morning.No flights were expected Tuesday at the region’s three airports. Amtrak service north of the District was not expected to resume at least until Wednesday. Tens of thousands of homes lost power.Gov. Martin O’Malley (D) said his state was “in the crosshairs” of a storm that “is going to .?.?. sit on Maryland and bear down on Maryland for a good 24 to 36 hours.”The days of preparation afforded by the storm’s slow march toward the coast could not save the region from the myriad damage that proves that much of what man makes is no match for hurricane winds and floodwaters.“This is one of, if not the, strongest storms on record in the Mid-Atlantic or Northeast,” said Jason Samenow of The Washington Post’s Capital Weather Gang. “In terms of a prolonged wind and rain event, this will be as strong as anything we’ve seen in several decades.”The central core of Hurricane Sandy turned from the Atlantic into the shoreline near Atlantic City after nightfall Monday, but for all its almost 1,000-mile wingspan, Sandy was just the central element of a massive confluence of weather. Its tropical weather was expected to collide with the jet stream to the west and then be pinned from escape by a powerful nor’easter that will hold it in place over a multistate region where almost 60 million people live.The bizarre combination of a late-season hurricane and a nor’easter, a storm type with some hurricane-like characteristics more common between October and April, was captured by Virginia Gov. Robert F. McDonnell (R).“You’ve got flooding in southeast Virginia,” McDonnell said. “You’ve got a blizzard in western and southwest Virginia. And you’ve got high winds and heavy rain in Northern Virginia.”For the second time in four months, lights flickered out in homes across the Washington region. The three major utilities fought a losing battle through the night to keep the power on, with regional outages reaching almost 160,000 by 9 p.m.“We lost power about 7:50 p.m.” on Monday, said Craig Barnabee of Shady Side. “We last lost it during those straight-line winds in late June, and it was out for two days.”Barnabee said he would start his generator Tuesday morning, but many people were likely to awake in darkness, unsure when their power might be restored.Although advance help had been enlisted from as far as Texas, the region’s utilities were reluctant to promise when lights would come back on. It was expected to remain windy here until Wednesday as the storm moved slowly on a swing through New England.“You have to wait until the wind subsides, then you hit it again as quickly as possible,” said Bob Hainey, spokesman for Pepco, which serves the District and much of the immediate Maryland suburbs. “The big word now is safety, safety, safety.”Pepco had to recall its crews briefly during the height of the Monday night winds because it’s unsafe to use bucket-truck extensions in winds above 35 mph.The National Weather Service warned that the Potomac River on Wednesday and Thursday would probably experience its worst flooding since a rapid snow melt after the blizzard of 1996.Authorities in Virginia said the entire 37-square-mile Chincoteague Island was underwater up to three feet deep. The 3,500 islanders who had opted to remain on Chincoteague were told to stay in place because the causeway to the mainland was closed.“It’s pretty rough,” police chief Edward Lewis said Monday night. “It’s blowing real hard. It’s raining sideways.”Winds are picking up and gusts are bringing trees and power lines down, said Mayor Jack Tarr.The wild ponies the island is known for had been moved to high ground before the storm.McDonnell said he would apply for federal help to cover the cost for repairing public buildings, infrastructure and overtime for public safety officials.Although the very worst of the storm was to have passed by daybreak Tuesday, the last of the wind and rain was expected to linger over the Washington area into Wednesday as the storm system pushed north over land into New England.Even before Sandy reached shore, Atlantic City and its fabled boardwalk had been badly beaten by winds and were under floodwaters. The same was true up and down the coast line.More than 100 feet of the fishing pier in Ocean City was snapped off by the angry surf. Those who ignored evacuation orders were told to stay put while the storm passed.“You run from the water, and you hide from the wind,” said Joseph Theobald, the city’s director of emergency services.Airlines had begun canceling flights up and down the East Coast over the weekend in advance of the storm, and it seemed unlikely local airports would return to normal until later in the week.“When the airlines resume service is dependent upon weather conditions here in Washington, as well as in other cities on the East Coast,” said Jonathan Dean, spokesman for Baltimore-Washington International Marshall Airport. “It may take several days to accommodate the passengers that were disrupted by the canceled flights.”Although Reagan National and Dulles International airports remained open, all flights were canceled Monday after the 9 a.m. departure of a flight from National to Atlanta and a 1:15 p.m. flight from Dulles to Tokyo.At the Dulles Travelers Aid desk, volunteer Don Webster stayed busy all afternoon trying to help stranded passengers with hotel discounts and to book flights for Wednesday. “Because it is an act of God, the airlines are not paying for hotels,” he said as he helped three passengers. “Not much the airline can do about this.”American Airlines spokesman Matt Miller said, “We’re hopeful that operations will resume in some cities on Wednesday, but it’s possible that the aftermath of the storm may force some additional delays and cancellations.”Several hospitals said advance warnings about the storm allowed them to stock up on medication, food, linens and other supplies to last for the next 48 hours. Surgeries and procedures were taking place on schedule Monday, and several hospitals said they expect to remain open and operational Tuesday. But at least one — Washington Adventist Hospital in Takoma Park — canceled elective surgeries for Monday afternoon and Tuesday, a spokeswoman said.Shelters in the District have been planning for several days for the storm, but there hasn’t been the expected influx of occupants yet.“We’re ready for it,” said David Berns, the director of D.C.’s Department of Human Services. “Now w</td>\n",

       "      <td>Contributions to American culture by Indian Americans are highlighted in “Beyond Bollywood: Indian Americans Shape the Nation,” an exhibition by the Smithsonian Asian Pacific American Center opening Feb. 27 at the National Museum of Natural History.With seven sections occupying 5,000 square feet, there’s a bigness to the exhibition reflecting the size of the subcontinent, and more than 200 years of history. Photos, art and artifacts will explore the muscle Indian Americans put into the nation’s railroads and infrastructure, their professional concentrations and achievements, and cultural, religious and civil rights highlights.“We wanted a title that people have a reference for, but this is not about Bollywood,” says curator Masum Momaya. “The exhibition is going to take you beyond what you know about Indians and Indian Americans,” though its color and design draw on Bollywood aesthetics. “The main wall colors are mango, magenta and bright plum. .?.?. Our culture is vibrant, so we wanted the gallery to reflect that.”A focal point of the exhibition will be a dress by designer Naeem Khan worn by First Lady Michelle Obama at the White House’s Governors Dinner in 2012.According to the 2010 Census, 17 million people in the United States are of Asian and Pacific Islander descent and by 2050, that it’s expected to be 41 million. Members of the Indian American community approached the Smithsonian about doing an exhibition in 2008, and curators began a concentrated effort to collect Indian American artifacts from around the country. The Smithsonian’s 137 million-object collection had objects from India, but few from Indian Americans.The exhibition will begin with migrants not only from India, but Indians from the Caribbean, Africa and even South America; a population widely spread throughout the British Empire, of which India was once a part. It includes early immigration history as well as a look at Indian Americans’ concentration as cab drivers, motel and small business owners, doctors and software engineers.In looking at fields in which Indian Americans are concentrated professionally, “we went for the most stereotypical ones with the idea of dismantling the stereotypes,” Momaya says.“Arts and Activism” explores Indian Americans contributions to social justice movements, and a section on religion and spirituality looks specifically at yoga. But it will probably be the section on Indian American cultural contributions — food, fashion, dance, music — that will be the most easily recognizable and feel most resonant. A re-creation of a dining table found in an Indian American family home will feature eight place settings with each symbolizing a moment in food history. These includes the first Indian American restaurants, cookbooks and when grocery stores began selling Indian food.And because so much food history is about family, ritual and lore, the section will have place settings on Thali — the Indian plates that travel well, hold piles of food and last decades. The American dish equivalent, Corelle dinnerware will be on the other side of the table. Indian Americans have “a cultural attraction to Corelle ware,” Momaya enthuses. She still has a set her parents gave her when she went to college. It was inexpensive, durable and families owned “one of three patterns that reminded people of India. Its texture, nuance, emotional resonance. People come in and see it and say wow, I have that same set of dishes in my cupboard today. It’s passing on history in a material sense, but also in terms of memory.”Khan, who designed Michelle Obama’s one-shouldered, sequin- and crystal-embellished gown, hails from a centuries-long line of garment embroiderers from India's Mughal Courts. Throughout the exhibition, that blending of very old, very traditional hallmarks of Indian culture will show up repeatedly, and in surprising ways, in American history and iconography.“I see this exhibition as American history, not just Indian American history,” says Momaya. “There are so many parallels.”“Beyond Bollywood: Indian Americans Shape the Nation”opening Feb. 27 runs through Feb., 2015 at the National Museum of Natural History, 10th St. and Constitution Ave. NW, Washington. 202-633-1000. www.mnh.si.edu.Five others to watch? The Maryland Historical Society in Baltimore is on a roll — albeit a traditional roll, tinged with traces of British aristocracy. Coming off heightened interest in bicentennial commemorations of the War of 1812, it is lending the original Francis Scott Key “Star-Spangled Banner” manuscript to the National Museum of American History for two weeks in June, where it will be displayed, for the first time, with the flag that inspired its creation. An Feb. 6 lecture, “The Artistic Legacy of the Calverts and Arundells in England and America,” promises to add texture and meaning to historic Maryland names many of us know only as exits off the highway. The “Bootleggers Bash: Rebooted” offers a chance to dress up in Prohibition-era clothing, swill beerand celebrate Maryland history. The Historical Society keeps up with the costuming by sponsoring a March 1 bus trip to Winterthur Museum Garden and Library outside Wilmington, Del., to view original costumes from the hit series “Downton Abbey.” The Maryland Historical Society, 201 W. Monument Street, Baltimore, 410-685-3750. www.mdhs.org.? The Heurich House Museum in Dupont Circle was the residence of local brewer and philanthropist Christian Heurich and is regarded as one of the most intact Victorian houses in the country. It closes yearly in January for maintenance and cleaning of the original furnishings and decorations, but will reopen Feb. 1 . A March launch for the book “Capital Beer” about the city’s beer history features beer tasting. In partnership with the In Series Opera, a salon-style concert, “The Romantics: Schubert and Goethe,” on April 11 and 12 focuses on early German romanticism. And it marks the first public concert using the museum’s hand-painted 1901 Steinway, given to Mrs. Heurich by Mr. Heurich after the birth of their son. The Heurich House Museum, 1307 New Hampshire, Ave. NW, Washington. 202-429-1894. www.heurichhouse.org. ?The Smithsonian’s Archives of American Art exhibition “M onuments Men: On the Frontline to Save Europe’s Art, 1942-1946,” will be displayed from Feb. 7 to April 20 at the Donald W. Reynolds Center for American Art and Portraiture. Through photographs, official records, maps and audio interviews, it details the efforts by a special U.S. Army unit of curators, scholars, architects, librarians, and archivists from the U.S. and Britain — Monuments Men — to locate and recover major artworks stolen by the Nazis. With a Hollywood blockbuster of the same name as a tie-in, interest in these compelling pieces of World War II history will be high. “Monuments Men: On the Frontline to Save Europe’s Art, 1942-1946” is open Feb. 7 through April 20 at the Donald W. Reynolds Center for American Art and Portraiture, 8th and F streets NW, Washington. 202-633-7940. www.aaa.si.edu.?In 2012, natural disasters affected 32 states at a cost of over $100 billion and drew increasing attention to the urgency for builders and planners to help mitigate their effects. The “Designing for Disaster ” exhibition opening May 11 at the National Building Museum examines the risks from natural hazards and ways to design and build safer, more disaster-resilient communities. The objects, multimedia and graphics of this exhibition will look at a range of responses to earthquakes, tornadoes, hurricanes and floods. It will show homes on unprotected coastal wetlands, along with disaster-resistant housing and facilities the exhibition Web site says are designed to deal with at least one hazard in an “exemplary,” “pragmatic” and, in some cases, beautiful way. “Designing for Disaster” opens May 11 at the National Building Museum, 401 F St. NW, Washington. 202-272-2448. www.nbm.org. ?This year marks the 50th anniversary of the Sm</td>\n",

       "      <td>It seems odd that something so large and ungainly should have the temerity to call itself “sport.” But such is the case with the larger-than-life Chrysler 300 S, a full-size sedan available with rear-wheel or four-wheel drive.Blame it on marketing — that syrupy mixture of fact and fantasy administered in heavy doses to take the “hard” out of “hard sell.” Consider, for example, the Chrysler 300 without the “S.”It is a large car in the tradition of big Detroit automobiles. It has a bold, brash, in-your-face demeanor. Yet, despite its pugnaciousness, there is something undeniably attractive about it. It is a boat so loaded with standard amenities that you almost don’t care if it stays docked.In fact, you might even prefer it. The Chrysler 300 — 16 feet, 7 inches long — consumes lots of real estate. It is not city-friendly, especially not in hyper-congested places such as New York, where every inch of road space is fiercely contested.And the base Chrysler 300, equipped with Chrysler’s standard 3.6-liter, V-6 gasoline engine (292 horsepower, 260 pound-feet of torque) is a boat with barely adequate power. It offers almost respectable fuel economy, 19 miles per gallon in the city and 31 miles per gallon on the highway, using regular or E85 (85 percent ethanol) gasoline.But you feel the full weight of the car, easily 5,100 pounds with two passengers and cargo, with that V-6 engine. In something as large as the Chrysler 300, it is better to move up the model line and get the available 5.7-liter gasoline V-8 (363 horsepower, 399 pound-feet of torque) and enjoy the power behind the car’s tough-dude mask. You also can up the power ante and get the Chrysler 300 SRT8 equipped with a 6.4-liter gasoline V-8 (470 horsepower, 470 pound-feet of torque).But the higher you move up the 300 line, the more money you spend, hitting a base price of nearly $50,000 for the 300 SRT8, about $20,000 above the base sticker of a standard-equipped Chrysler 300.So, what to do? You want the swagger and power of a Chrysler 300 SRT8, but you can’t afford the cost of that car. In come Chrysler’s marketing people with the 300 S package — the “S” indicating “sport.”It is mostly an appearance and equipment thing that does not really make the big sedan move any faster or handle any better than the base Chrysler 300. You get the same 3.6-liter, V-6 gasoline engine with a slight boost in horsepower — eight more horsepower, increasing maximum output to 300 hp. You get 20-inch diameter wheels instead of the 17-inch wheels sold as standard equipment on the base car. And you get a wonderfully menacing, blacked-out, bad-boy grille and, oh, yes, a big black “S” emblazoned on the face of the front seats of the car.What you don’t get is the 300 SRT8’s power and grunt. But, considering the higher price of that model and the cost of the gasoline needed to satisfy its thirst, it is probably best to go with the “S” appearance package and the available SafetyTec and Uconnect advanced safety technology and navigation packages, which are highly recommended by this column.And don’t fret. Unless you live near a racetrack, have the money to pay for using that facility and have the extra insurance cash to cover the cost of driving a 6.4-liter Chrysler 300 SRT8 the way it was engineered to be driven, you can do without that big engine.Enjoy the Chrysler 300 S. It is a big, comfortable automobile, perfect for driving long stretches of highway that don’t curve much. The SafetyTec package will keep you from swerving into the wrong lane or cutting in front of a vehicle fast approaching on your blind side. It also will automatically adjust your speed and distance while approaching the vehicle in front of you. And the optional Uconnect navigation system, with a standard, easy-to-use 8.4-inch touch screen, is one of the best in the business.Just remember that your 300 S, with a base 3.6-liter V-6, is mostly an equipment package. Don’t try to take on a 300 SRT8, or anything with similar horsepower.Nuts &amp; BoltsChrysler 300Bottom line:?Know what you are buying and why you are buying it, especially when shopping for a multilayered car line such as the Chrysler 300. If you simply want or need a big sedan with reasonable fuel economy, be happy with the base 300. If you just want to look tough, get the 300 S and, maybe, a shrink to help you deal with anger-management issues. If all you want is traditional Detroit big-car luxury, get the exceptionally well-equipped 300 C John Varvatos Luxury edition. If you live near a racetrack and you have the time and money to play there, check out the 300 SRT8 with the 6.4-liter V-8.Ride, acceleration and handling in the 300S 3.6 V-6: It gets acceptable/good marks in all three.Head-turning quotient: The car is more “get out of my way” than “hello.” Put another way: It is more Putin than Obama.Body style/layout: The Chrysler 300 is a front-engine, full-size sedan available with rear-wheel or with four-wheel-drive. It is offered with six equipment levels—300, 300 S, 300 C, 300 C John Varvatos Luxury Edition, 300 SRT8 Core, and the 300 SRT8.Engine/transmission: The car comes standard with a 3.6-liter, gasoline, 24-valve V-6 with variable timing linked to an eight-speed automatic transmission that also can be shifted manually. A 5.7-liter gasoline V-8 is optional for this model.Capacities: Seating is for five people. Long-legged types with tall hairdos report moderately comfortable rear seating. Cargo capacity with all seats in place is 16.3 cubic feet. The fuel tank holds 19.1 gallons of gasoline. Regular grade is okay. E85 (85 percent ethanol) is recommended for lower tailpipe emissions.Mileage: I averaged 27 miles per gallon in mostly highway driving.Safety: Standard equipment includes four-wheel disc brakes (ventilated front/solid rear); four-wheel antilock brake protection; emergency braking assistance; electronic brake-force distribution; electronic stability and traction control; high-intensity discharge headlamps; side and head air bags.Recommended optional safety equipment: Chrysler SafetyTec and Uconnect packages.Pricing: The 2014 Chrysler 300 S comes with a base price of $34,230 and a dealer’s invoice price of $32,756. Price as tested is $45,690 including $10,465 in options (the “S” appearance, SafetyTec and Uconnect packages) and a $995 shipping charge. Dealer’s price as tested is $43,690.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Last week, we unveiled Wonkblog's first use of the Post's CrowdSourced platform, to spur a discussion of what America's energy future holds. Here are a few of the more interesting comments.Says user ChrisStewart:The largest source of energy reduction will come from the Internet. Video conferencing (read Google Hangout) will reduce travel-related energy costs. Productivity suites will provide better work-from-home support (in your face, Yahoo!). And most importantly, top employees from Amazon will leak into the broader market. These smart people will use the web to improve supply chain management for small businesses, reducing the energy footprint of food delivery and other essential services.Optimistically, I hope that the Internet will move to cleaner sources of energy. This process will happen independently of the above energy saving techniques. If somehow, Amazon, Microsoft, and your local bank all find a way to power their datacenters with renewable power (or at least *not* dirty coal), then our energy future truly will be bright. Note, GreenPeace.org (see \"how clean is your cloud?\") suggests that a renewable-powered Internet is far off. C'est La Vie...Reader KMBelliott writes:Low Energy Nuclear reactions, aka cold fusion, deserve more attention. Cold fusion challenges our understanding of plasma fusion, which leads to its quick dismissal by many. However there is a growing body of research showing the effects are real and replicable.Mark Gibbs of Forbes is doing a good job following one of the more promising prospects. Start here for more. ElSurfeador makes a pitch--or at least a hope--for rapid advancement in solar technology.In an ideal world, solar becomes so efficient and cheap it would be the ultimate source, but not likely for a very long time (especially with cars). An achievable approach though would be to start widespread use of natural gas for vehicles. If there is any kind of \"Moore's Law\" applicable to solar, reliability and efficiency would continue to increase while cost decreases to the point where it can be effectively used for our electrical needs. We will still be a fossil fuel based world for a while but in these two areas significant improvement could be made. Especially if people realized that, aside from any environmental framework, renewable energy could be a viable strategic tool in America's security. If thru wind, solar, nuclear and natural gas we virtually eliminated our use of oil, you'd see the face of the mideast look much different.MelvinUdall suggests that there is a more obvious answer staring us in the face.Fossil Fuels. They are the *only* reliable, abundant source for at least the next thirty years. They will allow for the prosperity necessary for continued technological advancement. Those advancements make fossil fuel production and use cleaner while finding new technologies.The alternative is to deliberately cripple ourselves as other, smarter nations use fossil fuels. Those nations, such as China, India and more, do not care about environmental restrictions as we do. Look at China's air and tell me you want them to be the largest energy producers while we hobble ourselves with \"clean\" technologies that *can't* provide for our energy needs.Truly unleash coal, oil, natural gas and nuclear in America for the next thirty years and by the end of the century fossil fuels can and will be a thing of the past. Continue the suicidal \"green\" con game, worried about the nonexistant anthropogenic climate change while China and India pay them no mind, and we become a permanent second class nation in the 21stC.If LENr can be developed as a conventional energy source society would have unlimited energy with almost zero pollution. Pretty much what everyone is looking for, right?Guy Noir, meanwhile, suggests this:Molten Thorium Salt Reactors.The technology is safe and thorium is plentiful. Additional advantanges include not being able to to processed into nuclear weapons. In the 1960s, this was seen as a disadvantage.The Chinese are exploring it and the rest of the world is catching on. The USA needs to take leadership of this technology and usher in a new age of prosperity.Read the full Crowd Sourced here.

       "      <td>A close encounter of the rocky kind is set for Feb. 15, when an office-building-size asteroid will speed past Earth faster than a bullet and closer than some communications satellites.It will be the nearest recorded brush with a space rock so large, NASA scientists said Thursday.The good news: There’s no chance of an impact. At its closest, asteroid 2012 DA14 will pass about 17,000 miles above Earth.The bad news: A million other potentially dangerous — and unknown — city-killing space rocks are out there, and one of them could be on a collision course with Earth. Critics say NASA and other space agencies are not doing enough to scan for these threats.“It’s like Mother Nature sending a warning shot across our bow,” said Don Yeomans, who tracks asteroids for the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif.Satellite operators said they were monitoring the asteroid but expected it to safely cruise through a belt of satellites that are about 23,000 miles up.“We’re watching the situation, but there’s not a giant concern,” said Alex Horwitz, spokesman for Intelsat, which operates about 50 communications satellites.The Air Force, meanwhile, is leaving the tracking to NASA.An astronomer in Spain discovered the asteroid a year ago. Small, dim and speedy, it was a “slippery target” as it moved across a background of stars, said Jaime Nomen of the La Sagra Observatory in southern Spain.NASA-funded scientists then ran the numbers: The asteroid was about 150 feet wide. Its closest approach will occur at 2:24 p.m. Eastern time on the 15th. On the night side of the planet — mainly Asia and Australia — observers with small telescopes might see a pinpoint streaking at the rapid clip of two moon-widths per minute.Further observations refined the asteroid’s path. It cruises around the sun in an orbit almost identical to Earth’s. Our year is 365 days. Its year is a day longer. Like a drunk driver weaving across lanes, asteroid 2012 DA14 crosses paths with Earth twice a year, at varying distances.Despite these opportunities for disaster, scientists tracking the asteroid are confident 2012 DA14 won’t collide with us for at least the next century, which is as far as they’ve been able to project its path. Next week’s approach is the closest during that time.NASA began rigorously scanning the sky for cosmic hazards only in 1998, when Congress told it to. Agency scientists said Thursday they are confident their network of ground and space telescopes have found at least 95 percent of potentially planet-killing asteroids, those a half-mile wide or more. None of these monsters is headed toward Earth, Yeomans said. ?But the agency has done much worse identifying smaller threats, said Ed Lu, a former NASA astronaut. Lu spearheads the B612 Foundation, which last year began raising private funds to build an asteroid-spotting space telescope.“Saying we’re only going to find the civilization-killers is a [sub-par] threshold,” Lu said. “We can do better than that.”Lu said that so far the human race has spotted only about 1 percent of the smaller, but still dangerous, asteroids near Earth.Scars on our planet’s surface reveal a long history of violent, even cataclysmic, collisions.An asteroid the size of 2012 DA14 could wipe out a city, Yeomans said. It would explode with a force of 21 / 2 megatons of TNT — a nuclear bomb nearly 1,000 times more powerful than the one exploded over Hiroshima in 1945.There is only one recent impact of a space rock so large. In 1908, an asteroid or cometary fragment plowed into Siberia. The “Tunguska Event,” named for the unlucky but unpopulated locale, flattened millions of trees across nearly 1,000 square miles.Meteor Crater in Arizona — nearly a mile wide — was also probably gouged by an office-building-size space rock about 50,000 years ago.Moving up the scale of destruction, a “planet killer” about five miles wide slammed into the Gulf of Mexico 65 million years ago, most scientists say, triggering a planet-wide cataclysm that wiped out the dinosaurs. That scenario, once heavily debated, appears more certain after a study published Thursday in the journal Science found that most dinosaurs went extinct relatively soon after that collision. With the dinosaurs gone, mammals thrived, eventually evolving into people.“I think it’s fair to say, without the dinosaurs having gone extinct, we would not be here,” Paul Renne, director of the Berkeley Geochronology Center and leader of the study, told the Associated Press.Much smaller fragments — leftovers from the dawn of the solar system — skip into our atmosphere every day, sometimes streaking spectacularly across the sky as meteors. Car-size rocks arrive at a clip of about once per year.Asteroids as big as 2012 DA14 are expected to hit Earth much less frequently — about once every 1,200 years, Yeomans said.What to do if scientists detect an asteroid headed for Earth? Given enough lead time — say, 30 or 40 years — deflecting the threat will be feasible, Lu said. “If something’s going to hit, we’re going to pull out all the stops.”A Hollywood favorite — nuclear bombs — might work, as might gentler means such as parking a spacecraft near the asteroid so that its gravity pulls it to a safe orbit. Last year, the European Commission launched the NEOShield project to start planning such missions.“The hard part,” Lu said, “is finding the million or so asteroids this size or larger and getting advance notice.” If 2012 DA14 had been on a collision course for next week, the year-long lead time since its discovery would have been too brief to launch a deflection mission, said Lu.The B612 Foundation has raised a “few million dollars,” spokeswoman Diane Murphy said, but it needs $30 million or $40 million a year to build their telescope, which would scan the entire sky for city-killer-size rocks.Lindley Johnson, who heads NASA’s $6 million annual program to find near-Earth threats, acknowledged that the agency could do better. “We still have a lot of improvement to make in finding all of the hazardous asteroids,” he said.Case in point: The sky-scanning camera that first spotted asteroid 2012 DA14 was purchased not by NASA, but by a small nonprofit group, the Planetary Society.</td>\n",

       "      <td>The controversial discovery of 68-million-year-old soft tissue from the bones of a Tyrannosaurus rex finally has an explanation: According to new research, iron in the dinosaur’s body preserved the tissue before it could decay.The research, headed by Mary Schweitzer, a molecular paleontologist at North Carolina State University, explains how proteins — and possibly even DNA — can survive for millennia. Schweitzer and her colleagues first raised this question in 2005, when they found the seemingly impossible: soft tissue preserved inside the leg of an adolescent T. rex unearthed in Montana.“What we found was unusual, because it was still soft and still transparent and still flexible,” Schweitzer said. [See Images of a Near-Complete T. rex]T. rex tissue?The find was also controversial, because scientists had thought proteins that make up soft tissue should degrade in less than a million years in the best of conditions. In most cases, microbes feast on a dead animal’s soft tissue, destroying it within weeks. The tissue found in Montana must be something else, perhaps the product of a later bacterial invasion, critics argued.In 2007, Schweitzer and her colleagues analyzed the chemistry of the T. rex proteins. They found that the proteins really had come from dinosaur soft tissue. The tissue was collagen, they reported in the journal Science, and it shared similarities with bird collagen — which makes sense, because modern birds evolved from theropod dinosaurs such as T. rex.The researchers also analyzed other fossils for the presence of soft tissue and found that it was present in about half of their samples going back to the Jurassic period, which lasted from 145.5 million to 199.6 million years ago, Schweitzer said.“The problem is, for 300 years, we thought, ‘Well, the organics are all gone, so why should we look for something that’s not going to be there?’ and nobody looks,” she said.The obvious question, though, was how soft, pliable tissue could survive for millions of years. In a study published last week, Schweitzer thinks she has the answer: iron.Iron ladyIron is an element present in abundance in the body, particularly in the blood, where it is part of the protein that carries oxygen from the lungs to the tissues. Iron is also highly reactive with other molecules, so the body keeps it locked up tight, bound to molecules that prevent it from wreaking havoc on the tissues.After death, though, iron is set free from its cage. It forms minuscule iron nanoparticles and also generates free radicals, which are highly reactive molecules thought to be involved in aging.“The free radicals cause proteins and cell membranes to tie in knots,” Schweitzer said. “They basically act like formaldehyde.”Formaldehyde, of course, preserves tissue. It works by linking up, or cross-linking, the amino acids that make up proteins, a process that makes those proteins more resistant to decay.Schweitzer and her colleagues found that dinosaur soft tissue is closely associated with iron nanoparticles in both the T. rex soft-tissue specimen and another from Brachylophosaurus canadensis, a duck-billed dinosaur. They then tested the iron-as-preservative idea using modern ostrich blood vessels. They soaked one group of blood vessels in iron-rich liquid made of red blood cells and another group in water. The blood vessels left in water turned into a disgusting mess within days. The blood vessels soaked in red blood cells remain recognizable after sitting at room temperature for two years. [Paleo-Art: Illustrations Bring Dinosaurs to Life]Searching for soft tissueDinosaurs’ iron-rich blood, combined with a good environment for fossilization, may explain the amazing existence of soft tissue from the Cretaceous period — which lasted from about 65.5 million to 145.5 million years ago — and even earlier. The specimens Schweitzer works with, including skin, show evidence of excellent preservation. The bones of these specimens are articulated, not scattered, suggesting they were buried quickly. They’re also buried in sandstone, which is porous and may wick away bacteria and reactive enzymes that would otherwise degrade the bone.Schweitzer is set to search for more dinosaur soft tissue next summer. “I’d like to find a honking big T. rex that’s completely articulated that’s still in the ground, or something similar,” she said. To preserve the chemistry of potential soft tissue, the specimens must not be treated with preservatives or glue, as most fossil bones are, she said. And they need to be tested quickly, because soft tissue may degrade once exposed to modern air and humidity.Importantly, Schweitzer and her colleagues have figured out how to remove the iron from their samples, which enables them to analyze the original proteins. They’ve even found proteins that are chemically consistent with being DNA, though Schweitzer is quick to note that she hasn’t proved they really are DNA. The iron-removing techniques should allow paleontologists to search more effectively for soft tissue and to test it when they find it.“Once we can get the chemistry behind some of these soft tissues, there’s all sorts of questions we can ask of ancient organisms,” Schweitzer said.— LiveScience Image Gallery: The Life of T.

       "      <td>According to more than 60 percent of technology experts interviewed by the Pew Internet and American Life Project, a major cyberattack will happen between now and 2025 and it will be extensive enough to cause “significant loss of life or property losses/damage/theft at the levels of tens of billions of dollars.” Preventing a cyber attack of that magnitude – what former U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta famously referred to as a “cyber Pearl Harbor” in 2012 — will require a tremendous amount of innovative thinking from our nation’s military leaders.The reason, quite simply, is that, given the shadowy nature of cyberattacks, we may not even know the true enemy, the full extent of the damage, or even how the attack was pulled off. In the digital era, a full frontal attack from a known assailant, similar to (what appears to be) a North Korean hacker attack on Sony Pictures is unlikely. In that case, you have known damage, a clear motive (retaliation for an upcoming film critical of North Korea), and an unfriendly state government calling the cyberattack “a righteous deed.” In contrast, dealing with shadowy digital adversaries is much more difficult.The good news is that Ashton “Ash” Carter, the man tapped to become the next U.S. Defense Secretary, is a science guy, a policy wonk and someone who’s big on cybersecurity. And, based on his efforts to reorganize the nation’s Cyber Command and remarks he’s made at the Aspen Security Forum in July 2013, he also appears to be at the forefront of bringing innovation to the way the nation’s military thinks about cyber warfare.Take, for example, the difficult task of drawing a red line at what constitutes a cyber attack against the United States and then determining the appropriate response. We’ve already seen this with the U.S. government’s difficulty in responding to suspected China cyberattacks — if you don’t know exactly what’s happening and who’s doing it, it’s hard to get someone to stop. North Korean hackers possibly attacking a major Hollywood studio may get all the attention these days, but the more real concern is Russian hackers breaking into NATO or the White House, or Chinese hackers launching round after round of corporate espionage attacks.And those are just the attacks we know about. The real threat could come from almost anywhere — a bunch of rogue hackers from, say, ISIS or Al-Qaeda – or even a domestic cyber threat, in the form of someone such as Edward Snowden threatening to bring down the whole system. If there’s a Stuxnet virus going around capable of taking down Iranian nuclear reactors, it’s safe to assume that, eventually, there could be viruses capable of taking down American nuclear reactors as well.And then there’s the shifting notion of what the military should actually be defending. As Ashton Carter explained at the Aspen Security Forum, the defense establishment needs to think about defending military networks as well as the nation’s private sector networks. This is a fundamentally new threat — and will require much more coordination between the private sector and the defense industry, especially because so much of the nation’s infrastructure — think power plants and the grid — are generally viewed as vulnerable to a potential attack.It’s not for nothing that Henry Kissinger has written in his new book that “cyberspace challenges all historical experience.” The preeminent realist of our era — even if he freely admits that he doesn’t know how the Internet works — fundamentally grasps the Internet as a tool of power. Cyberspace means that geopolitical rivals now have the ability “to access the cyber domain to disable and potentially destroy critical infrastructure from a position of near-complete anonymity.” That, of course, leads to the shifting notion of what “offensive capabilities” mean in the modern digital age. What do you do if someone’s attacked your infrastructure? In the 20th century, “offensive capabilities” referred to tanks, planes and missiles. In the digital era, they are tools like viruses and malware. Carter refers to these tools as the ability to “nullify cyberadvantage on the part of others” — partially in recognition that any new technologies in the hands of the U.S. military — and we’ve already seen this with drones — are bound to cause a lot of concern. “It’s a new field of warfare. Obviously, we want to do things as we try always to do, in a way that is lawful and in a way that our population can support and is consistent with our values,” he explained.Of course, there are some who discount the threat of a cyber Pearl Harbor. They claim that it is overhyped, that it’s just a “myth” and that it’s just a way to sell more virus prevention software, or a way to shift private sector costs of defending computer networks on to the government sector. Fair enough. But, let’s face it, that’s probably the same type of thinking that made a Japanese attack 73 years ago seem so unlikely or a 9/11 attack seem unfathomable just 13 years ago. There are so many unknown unknowns that it’s easy just to assume the problem doesn’t exist.Whether you believe in the threat of cyber Pearl Harbor or not, it’s clear that innovative thinking will be required to address emerging new cyber threats — and soon. In order to prevent a cyber Pearl Harbor, we’ll need fewer military guys and more cyber guys. Right now, there are about 4,000 members of the U.S. Cyber Command. These are the people who will be forced to make a judgment call when an attack has taken place, estimate the full extent of the damage and then figure out how to retaliate using the types of new offensive capabilities that have emerged in just the last few years.</td>\n",

       "      <td>House Republicans narrowly approved a sweeping overhaul of the nation’s food stamp program Thursday that would slash about $39 billion in funding over the next decade, cut aid to about 4 million Americans in the next few years and shift the burden of providing aid to some of the nation’s poor to state governments.The GOP-backed plan differs sharply from a bipartisan Senate proposal passed in June, and its passage will further strain relations between the two chambers as they spend the next several weeks toiling over a short-term budget deal and negotiating over raising the federal debt limit.As those battles begin, Thursday’s vote is a victory for House Majority Leader Eric I. Cantor (R-Va.), who orchestrated a strategy this summer to split apart the farm bill to consider funding for food stamps, or the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, separately from legislation authorizing crop subsidies and an overhaul of many agricultural and conservation programs.Cantor said the deep cuts enacted Thursday were necessary because while most SNAP recipients need the assistance, there are too many people “that choose to abuse the system.”“Frankly it’s wrong for hard-working middle-class Americans to pay for that,” Cantor said.Rep. Tim Huelskamp (R-Kan.), a strong supporter of the bill, said that stiffer work requirements for certain adults applying for SNAP funds mean “you can no longer sit on your couch…and expect the federal taxpayer to feed you.”The House voted 217 to 210, with all members of the Democratic caucus present voting against the plan. The House can now begin long-delayed negotiations with the Senate over a final version of the farm bill, which would once again merge food aid with other agricultural policy.But in a rambling speech on the Senate floor Thursday morning, Majority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.) slammed the GOP strategy, saying that Republicans have “turned their backs” on low-income families in hopes of making budget cuts. Citing his frequent trips to the grocery store with his wife, Landra, Reid said that proposed cuts in SNAP funding would make it difficult for some recipients to buy hamburger meat and milk in the same shopping trip.In the House, Democrats used the hours before the vote to criticize Republicans for stripping SNAP recipients of their aid. They repeatedly cited an op-ed by former Senate majority leaders Tom Daschle (D-S.D.) and Robert Dole (R-Kan.) published Monday in the Los Angeles Times who argued that “this is no time to play politics with hunger.”Brandishing a cooked steak, bottle of vodka and can of caviar on the House floor, Rep. Jackie Speier (D-Calif.) suggested that money spent by lawmakers on official overseas travel could easily help pay for food stamps for the hungry. One lawmaker received more than $3,500 to spend on food and lodging during a six-day trip to Russia — roughly equal to a year’s worth of SNAP funding for some recipients, she said.The House bill would cut overall SNAP spending by slightly more than five percent over the next decade, largely through two provisions that would significantly affect states.The first reinstates restrictions on many able-bodied, childless adults aged 18 to 50 who receive SNAP benefits. It accounts for roughly half the cuts. Under those limits, 1.7 million people would lose benefits next year, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office reported on Monday. Under federal law, those able-bodied adults may collect only limited benefits — up to three months over a three-year period — unless they work more than 20 hours per week or are in a job-training program.RELATED GRAPHIC:</td>\n",

       "      <td>Iran's journalists in chains from Committee to Protect Journalists on Vimeo.Journalism can be a tough gig for Iranians, who face secrecy and the risk of retribution, and it seems to be getting tougher. A video by the Committee to Protect Journalists shows a rising trend in reporters being imprisoned for such charges as \"insulting the supreme leader\" or \"spreading propaganda against the state;\" in other words, for doing journalism. Some have faced solitary confinement, forced confessions, even death.That trend started getting worse, the press freedom group says, shortly after Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was elected president in late 2005. And it got much, much worse after the disputed 2009 presidential election, in which mass protests called for a recount but were ultimately put down by security forces.Here, from a recent Committee to Protest Journalists report on Iranian press freedom abuses, is the cumulative – and, presumably, desired – effect of those arrests. (My emphasis added.)As devastating as the imprisonments are to the individual journalists and their families, the Iranian government’s tactics have had an intimidating effect on the press, choking off the flow of information. This census and CPJ’s past surveys are simply snapshots in time—they do not include the large numbers of journalists convicted of crimes or facing charges who are temporarily free on bail or furlough. Iran has pursued a revolving-door policy in imprisoning journalists, freeing some detainees on short-term furloughs even as they make new arrests. The pattern of rotating critical journalists in and out of prison has sown fear and self-censorship across the entire press corps, according to CPJ research. At least 68 Iranian journalists fled into exile between 2007 and 2012 due to harassment and the threat of imprisonment, according to CPJ research. Only Somali journalists have gone into exile in higher numbers during that period.The Washington Post's Jason Rezaian reported in January about Iranian journalists who had been arrested for allegedly working with foreign media such as the BBC.</td>\n",

It also details a woefully inadequate warning system, in which manufacturers failed to inform health officials to potential problems linked to their devices, hospitals failed to alert federal regulators about outbreaks and the Food and Drug Administration was slow to identify the problem and alert the public.“Patients should be able to trust that the devices they need for treatment are safe and effective,\" Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.), whose staff began investigating the issue a year ago, said in a statement. \"Unfortunately, this investigation makes clear that current policies for monitoring medical device safety put patients at risk, and in this case, allowed tragedies to occur that could have, and should have, been prevented.\"Duodenoscopes are used in hundreds of thousands of procedures each year in the United States to drain fluids from pancreatic and bile ducts blocked by cancer tumors, gallstones and other conditions. During a typical procedure, a flexible, lighted tube is threaded down the throat and stomach and into the top of the small intestine. Unlike other endoscopes, duodenoscopes have a movable “elevator” mechanism at one end that allows the instrument to maneuver into ducts and fix fluid-drainage problems. That intricate design can make the devices difficult to sterilize between uses.[Tracking a superbug outbreak: 'The big question is, why did it take so long?']Doctors consider duodenoscopes an important tool in detecting and treating medical problems early and in a minimally invasive way. But in recent years, the devices also have been linked to the spread of a growing number of antibiotic-resistant \"superbug\" infections.An outbreak involving contaminated scopes last year at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center in Los Angeles left at least two people dead, and officials said scores of other patients potentially were exposed to the dangerous bacteria. At Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, also in Los Angeles, four patients were infected by a superbug after undergoing a duodenoscope procedure. A Connecticut hospital said it had contacted nearly 300 patients who might have been exposed to a dangerous type of drug-resistant E. coli after undergoing duodenoscope procedures.Since 2012, other outbreaks have occurred at Advocate Lutheran General Hospital near Chicago, where 44 people were infected, and at the Virginia Mason Medical Center in Seattle, where at least 32 patients became ill and 11 died.Such incidents prompted the FDA in February to alert doctors and hospitals that duodenoscopes can be difficult to sanitize between uses and “may facilitate the spread of deadly bacteria.” The agency also sent warning letters to the primary manufacturers of the devices -- Olympus, Pentax and Fujifilm -- saying the companies failed to adequately report problems with the devices and, in some instances, failed to ensure that they could be cleaned properly between uses.But Wednesday's Senate report documents a deeper history of infections linked to tainted scopes than previously reported. Investigators detailed dozens of outbreaks at hospitals from New York to Florida to Wisconsin, as well as overseas as hospitals in Germany, France and the Netherlands. \"These outbreaks infected at least 250 people with life-threatening illnesses, including carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE), a dangerous superbug that is resistant to our most potent antibiotics and that kills about half of those it infects,\" they wrote.The report spreads blame among device manufacturers, hospitals and the FDA, as well as what investigators say is an insufficient, outdated system of oversight that prevents health officials from spotting potential problems with medical devices in general. Device manufacturers failed to adequately test whether their scopes could be properly cleaned in a real-world setting, and didn't meet requirements to self-report problems quickly to regulators. Many hospitals also were slow to report infections to manufacturers and federal agencies. And the FDA, in part hamstrung by an ineffective surveillance system, failed to spot the deadly infections linked to contaminated scopes quickly or to alert the public. The report calls for a series of legislative and regulatory changes aimed at helping officials more rapidly identify and combat problems with medical devices.The FDA said in a statement it will “carefully consider” the recommendations from Wednesday’s report, and that mitigating the risk of deadly infections associated with duodenoscopes is a “top priority” for the agency.“We agree with the senator that a broader approach to understanding how well duodenoscope devices work in real-time use is critical to public health,” the agency wrote. “The FDA has taken several actions to address the issue of duodeoscope-related infections and will continue to work to protect patients, while ensuring access to these important devices for those who may benefit from minimally invasive procedures.”Mark Miller, a spokesman for Olympus Corp. of the Americas, said the company had cooperated with Senate investigators, providing documents and answering questions. \"Although we do not agree with all of the report’s conclusions, we are closely reviewing the recommendations in the report as part of Olympus’ ongoing efforts to increase patient safety associated with use of Olympus duodenoscopes.” A spokeswoman for Pentax said the company is reviewing Wednesday's report and that it \"will continue to work with Congress, FDA and the industry to reduce the risk of infection in flexible endoscopy.\" A spokeswoman for Fujifilm said patient safety remains the company's top priority, \"and we are committed to working together with all stakeholders, including patients, hospitals, regulators and lawmakers, to ensure the long-term sustainable use of duodenoscopes.\"This post has been updated.READ MORE:FDA warns about medical scopes after ‘superbug’ hits California hospitalFDA nominee sails through Senate committee, but could a fish stand in his way?Prescription drug prices jumped more than 10 percent in 2015, analysis finds‘What can we do better?’ Trying to make the nation’s food system safer in 2016.How cancer will affect Americans in 2016 — in seven charts</td>\n",

That intricate design can make the devices difficult to sterilize between uses.[Tracking a superbug outbreak: 'The big question is, why did it take so long?']Doctors consider duodenoscopes an important tool in detecting and treating medical problems early and in a minimally invasive way. But in recent years, the devices also have been linked to the spread of a growing number of antibiotic-resistant \"superbug\" infections.An outbreak involving contaminated scopes last year at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center in Los Angeles left at least two people dead, and officials said scores of other patients potentially were exposed to the dangerous bacteria. At Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, also in Los Angeles, four patients were infected by a superbug after undergoing a duodenoscope procedure. A Connecticut hospital said it had contacted nearly 300 patients who might have been exposed to a dangerous type of drug-resistant E. coli after undergoing duodenoscope procedures.Since 2012, other outbreaks have occurred at Advocate Lutheran General Hospital near Chicago, where 44 people were infected, and at the Virginia Mason Medical Center in Seattle, where at least 32 patients became ill and 11 died.Such incidents prompted the FDA in February to alert doctors and hospitals that duodenoscopes can be difficult to sanitize between uses and “may facilitate the spread of deadly bacteria.” The agency also sent warning letters to the primary manufacturers of the devices -- Olympus, Pentax and Fujifilm -- saying the companies failed to adequately report problems with the devices and, in some instances, failed to ensure that they could be cleaned properly between uses.But Wednesday's Senate report documents a deeper history of infections linked to tainted scopes than previously reported. Investigators detailed dozens of outbreaks at hospitals from New York to Florida to Wisconsin, as well as overseas as hospitals in Germany, France and the Netherlands. \"These outbreaks infected at least 250 people with life-threatening illnesses, including carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE), a dangerous superbug that is resistant to our most potent antibiotics and that kills about half of those it infects,\" they wrote.The report spreads blame among device manufacturers, hospitals and the FDA, as well as what investigators say is an insufficient, outdated system of oversight that prevents health officials from spotting potential problems with medical devices in general. Device manufacturers failed to adequately test whether their scopes could be properly cleaned in a real-world setting, and didn't meet requirements to self-report problems quickly to regulators. Many hospitals also were slow to report infections to manufacturers and federal agencies. And the FDA, in part hamstrung by an ineffective surveillance system, failed to spot the deadly infections linked to contaminated scopes quickly or to alert the public. The report calls for a series of legislative and regulatory changes aimed at helping officials more rapidly identify and combat problems with medical devices.The FDA said in a statement it will “carefully consider” the recommendations from Wednesday’s report, and that mitigating the risk of deadly infections associated with duodenoscopes is a “top priority” for the agency.“We agree with the senator that a broader approach to understanding how well duodenoscope devices work in real-time use is critical to public health,” the agency wrote. “The FDA has taken several actions to address the issue of duodeoscope-related infections and will continue to work to protect patients, while ensuring access to these important devices for those who may benefit from minimally invasive procedures.”Mark Miller, a spokesman for Olympus Corp. of the Americas, said the company had cooperated with Senate investigators, providing documents and answering questions. \"Although we do not agree with all of the report’s conclusions, we are closely reviewing the recommendations in the report as part of Olympus’ ongoing efforts to increase patient safety associated with use of Olympus duodenoscopes.” A spokeswoman for Pentax said the company is reviewing Wednesday's report and that it \"will continue to work with Congress, FDA and the industry to reduce the risk of infection in flexible endoscopy.\" A spokeswoman for Fujifilm said patient safety remains the company's top priority, \"and we are committed to working together with all stakeholders, including patients, hospitals, regulators and lawmakers, to ensure the long-term sustainable use of duodenoscopes.\"This post has been updated.READ MORE:FDA warns about medical scopes after ‘superbug’ hits California hospitalFDA nominee sails through Senate committee, but could a fish stand in his way?Prescription drug prices jumped more than 10 percent in 2015, analysis finds‘What can we do better?’ Trying to make the nation’s food system safer in 2016.How cancer will affect Americans in 2016 — in seven charts</td>\n",

       "      <td>Dear readers:This is a day that my family and I never expected to come. The Washington Post Company is selling the newspaper it has owned and nurtured for eight decades.In addition to The Washington Post, the company is selling Greater Washington Publishing, the Gazette newspapers, Express, El Tiempo Latino and Robinson Terminal.The buyer is one of America’s great innovators and most respected business leaders, Jeff Bezos, chief executive officer and founder of Amazon.com. Mr. Bezos is making this acquisition in his personal capacity and not as part of Amazon.The board of our parent corporation, including my uncle and company chairman Don Graham, made this decision with a heavy heart but with an absolute conviction that Mr. Bezos’s ownership represents a unique and extraordinary opportunity for The Washington Post and for you, our readers.In Mr. Bezos we have found an owner who will continue the tradition that the Graham family started with the purchase of The Washington Post by Eugene Meyer in 1933. Since then, and most especially over the past four decades, The Washington Post has earned a worldwide reputation for tough, penetrating, insightful, and indispensable journalism. With the investment by Mr. Bezos, that tradition will continue.Mr. Bezos is widely known, of course, as the founder and CEO of Amazon.com. He is a proven entrepreneur who, like the Graham family and this company, takes the long-term view in his investments. While he expects The Post to remain profitable, his focus is on the essential role that our journalism has on dialogue and the flow of information in our society.Mr. Bezos knows as well as anyone the opportunities that come with revolutionary technology when we understand how to make the most of it. Under his ownership and with his management savvy, we will be able to accelerate the pace and quality of innovation.Mr. Bezos has asked that I remain as Publisher and CEO of The Post. I am honored to continue in that role. Our mission does not change. Nor do the values that have been at the core of The Post’s enduring strength over many decades. Mr. Bezos shares the principles that have guided the Graham family’s proud stewardship of this great news organization.I have attached a letter that he sent to the employees of The Washington Post below for you to read.With Mr. Bezos as our owner, we enter a new era and embrace an exciting future. I look forward to it, and I firmly believe you should as well.Yours truly,Katharine WeymouthPublisher and CEOThe Washington Post</td>\n",

       "      <td>A U.S. jury on Thursday convicted two accused Los Zetas drug cartel hit men of killing U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Special Agent Jaime Zapata and wounding another ICE agent in a February 2011 roadside shooting in Mexico.A jury of seven men and five women in Washington deliberated less than five hours before finding Jose Emanuel Garcia Sota, 35, known as “Safado,” and Jesus Ivan Quezada Piña, 29, known as “Loco,” guilty on four counts each including murder and attempted murder of a U.S. officer and firearms violations.U.S. District Judge Royce C. Lamberth scheduled an Aug. 29 hearing to set a sentencing date after prosecutors coordinate the attendance of the families of Zapata, 32, and Victor Avila Jr., 44, who live in Texas.In a statement, U.S. attorney Channing D. Phillips said the verdicts brought to seven the number of Los Zetas cartel members convicted of the botched afternoon carjacking attempt on Feb. 15, 2011, that resulted in the death of Zapata, the first U.S. law enforcement agent killed in the line of duty in Mexico since 1985.U.S. authorities in May 2013 announced guilty pleas by Zetas cartel commander Julian Zapata Espinoza, known as “El Piolin,” 35, for leading the attack, and other members of two alleged, four-man hit squads on related charges. Several face the possibility of mandatory life sentences, and three testified in this month’s trial.“The victims of this horrific assault were in Mexico on official business serving our country,” Phillips said. “The prosecution of these defendants is a testament to the enormous resources devoted to this investigation by law enforcement in the United States and Mexico.”Reached by telephone, Avila, said “I’m glad that justice has been served for Jaime Zapata.” Avila retired from ICE in 2015 and made his first public comments on the shooting in his testimony during the 12-day trial in Washington.“It’s still not over,” Avila said, saying he and Zapata’s family would seek life sentences for their assailants and would continue seeking records and help from Congress about what the U.S. government knew about the attack. “Despite the guilty verdict, there are still many questions that have not been answered, specifically from” the Department of Homeland Security, ICE’s parent department, Avila said.Families have criticized ICE for sending the men with inadequate security, and questioned the role of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. In March, the Justice Department’s inspector general found that two of the weapons used in Zapata’s killing were trafficked by suspects whom ATF in Dallas had under surveillance but had not arrested.Benigno Trey Martinez III, an attorney for Zapata’s parents, Mary and Amador Zapata Jr., of Brownsville, Tex., said “they were very emotional” when he told them of the verdict. “All that Mr. and Mrs. Zapata have ever wanted is justice for Jaime. I know they look forward to facing each of these defendants and having an opportunity to speak their mind before the judge at time of sentencing.”The jury foreman, who was interviewed separately and spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals by the cartel, said, “This was a horrific crime, perpetrated by individuals who were brutal and hateful, and the decisions that they made in their lives that brought them to this point exemplify the worst in humanity.”Zapata’s death highlighted American involvement in the U.S.-backed drug war in Mexico. The manhunt for those responsible for his death — and tougher sanctions — helped fragment what once was known as Mexico’s most technologically sophisticated and violent paramilitary criminal organizations.Drug violence-related homicides are surging again in Mexico after dipping since 2011, and extraditions continue, including those of two former Mexican state governors accused of corruption at the hands of the Zetas.U.S. authorities have also sought the extradition of Miguel Angel Treviño Morales, the reported leader of Los Zetas known as “Z-40,” who has been suspected in the ambush of the ICE agents and other Americans, and is under indictment in the District, New York City and Texas.Court-appointed attorneys for Garcia Sota and Quezada Piña had argued that no physical evidence tied the men to the crime, only the at times contradictory and shifting testimony of cooperating Zetas witnesses seeking to avoid mandatory life prison sentences.“The speed with which the verdict was returned suggest to me the jury was motivated by the raw emotion of this case,” said Robert A. Feitel, the counsel for Garcia Sota. “That’s understandable, but not how the criminal justice system is supposed to operate, but we respect the verdict.”Read more:‘We are shot!

       "      <td>Among Capitol Hill staffers, no rumor travels faster than one involving free food.So, when word got out last week that Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.) had installed a commercial-sized freezer in her office lobby stocked with gratis ice-cream treats, the resulting stampede was as predictable as a party-line vote.But those who arrived a day late to the run on the sweets were out of luck. One staffer from a nearby office found the case locked, and was turned away, cone-less.“While we’re pleased the freezer has generated such interest and a number of wistful, longing glances from other offices, its sweet, chilly contents are reserved for Sen. McCaskill’s constituents who are visiting Washington this summer,” her spokeswoman tells us.Most congressional offices offer treats to vistitors made in their home states or districts (it’s impossible to leave a Georgia member’s office without a bag or three of peanuts). Ethics rules allow members to accept such goods from manufacturers back home, making the arrangement an all-around win: it’s good publicity for the companies, and members like the chance to offer guests a little something. (Hey, with Congress’ approval-rating at an all-time low, who wouldn’t want to throw in a free candy bar with that governance?).While the snacks are most often given to folks on business visits or in tour groups, aides from neighboring offices sometimes drop by to partake. McCaskill’s ice-cream lockdown is a testament to the novelty of the offering — and the sweltering temperatures. And, it turns out, it’s only for a limited time.The freezer in the Missouri Democrat’s digs is on loan for the month of July, aka, National Ice Cream Month, from Unilever, which produces frozen favorites like Breyers, Good Humor, and Klondike, at its Missouri plant.So get them while — and if — you can.And if not, there are plenty of other goodies available. Here are some of the most popular items up for grabs in Senate offices, according to staffers:Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) — Dr. Pepper and DoritosSen.

       "      <td>Saturn's moon Titan has been called the most Earthlike world found to date. It's the only other place in the solar system where stable liquid sits on the surface — seas of liquid methane flow into channels that have created magnificent canyons — and scientists have suggested that the icy world might be able to support some kind of alien life.Now researchers think they can add yet another \"Earthlike\" quality to Titan's extensive list: According to a study in Geophysical Research Letters, a seemingly impossible cloud on Titan may be created by weather processes we've seen before at home.The unlikely cloud type was first spotted decades ago by NASA's Voyager 1 spacecraft. It was made of a carbon- and nitrogen-based compound called dicyanoacetylene (C4N2). C4N2 is part of the chemical cocktail that cloaks Titan in an orange-colored haze. But high up in the stratosphere where this particular cloud sat, the compound was scarce. Scientists could find just 1 percent of the amount of C4N2 that should have been needed to create the cloud.NASA's Cassini mission recently spotted a second example of this crazy kind of cloud. When they used Cassini's instruments to puzzle out the chemical composition of the ice cloud and its surroundings, scientists came up with the same impossible answer: The stratosphere-dwelling ice cloud is made of dicyanoacetylene, but the stratosphere is sorely lacking in that particular compound.Clouds aren't unusual on Titan — they form when methane cools and condenses, just as clouds made of water form on Earth. Things are a little different when they form in the stratosphere — at the moon's poles, circulation patterns force warm gasses down until they sink, cool and condense — but in both cases, the clouds form when ice and vapor reach a state of equilibrium.In the case of these strange ice clouds on Titan, the amount of dicyanoacetylene vapor present in the area shouldn't be enough to keep the ice trapped in the cloud in equilibrium.\"The appearance of this ice cloud goes against everything we know about the way clouds form on Titan,\" lead study author Carrie Anderson of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center said in a statement.But Anderson and her colleagues think they've found an answer — in the clouds that damage Earth's ozone layer.Earth has certain clouds that forego condensation altogether, forming instead through a kind of \"solid-state\" chemistry based on the interactions of ice particles. On Earth, these guys are bad news: Chlorine-based chemicals enter the air by way of pollution on the ground, then meet up with icy water crystals in the dry stratosphere. The chemical reactions that occur in these wispy clouds release chlorine molecules, which eat away at the ozone layer.On Titan, a similar process could create the mysterious ice clouds: Anderson and her colleagues suggest that cyanoacetylene, a more common compound containing hydrogen, carbon and nitrogen, could become coated with hydrogen cyanide as it moved down the stratosphere in the form of icy crystals. If ultraviolet rays from the sun struck one of these dual-layer ice crystals, the resulting chemical reaction would release dicyanoacetylene and hydrogen. Voila, a cloud!\"The compositions of the polar stratospheres of Titan and Earth could not differ more,\" Goddard's Michael Flasar said in a statement. \"It is amazing to see how well the underlying physics of both atmospheres has led to analogous cloud chemistry.\"The Cassini orbiter has been studying Saturn and its wonderful moons for over a decade, but the mission is coming to a close. The mission will end in September 2017, but first NASA is undertaking a \"Grand Finale\" in April. Cassini will dive into the space between Saturn and its rings — an area never before visited — 22 times. On Sept. 15, 2017, Cassini will dive for the last time, plunging into Saturn's atmosphere to send home unprecedented data on the planet's composition.\"We may be counting down, but no one should count Cassini out yet,\" Cassini program scientist Curt Niebur said in a statement. \"The journey ahead is going to be a truly thrilling ride.\"Read More:Water bears’ latest superpower: Proteins that protect them from radiationHow black widow mothers control their children’s cannibalism Dear Science: How does heavy rain stay up in the clouds?NASA just found a spacecraft that’s been lost for two years</td>\n",

       "      <td>Six months after he was released from prison in Iran, PEN Center USA has announced that The Post’s Jason Rezaian will receive the Freedom to Write Award at the center’s Literary Awards Festival gala in September. Willow Bay, director of the University of Southern California’s Annenberg School for Journalism, will receive the Award of Honor, given to a person or institution that has “made meaningful contributions to the world of writers and journalists.”Rezaian’s 545 days of imprisonment drew international attention to his plight and that of his wife, Yeganeh Salehi. Salehi was arrested along with Rezaian, though she was released on bail, while he remained in Evin Prison. The couple returned to the United States, along with Rezaian’s mother, in January, as part of a deal negotiated to secure the freedom of a number of Iranian Americans who had also been jailed in Iran.Though Rezaian is hardly the only journalist, American or otherwise, to be detained around the world, his case raised important issues about how the United States should respond when American citizens working as journalists are jailed overseas.Marvin Putnam, chair of PEN Center USA’s board of directors, said that he thought it would be difficult to develop “any single, clear foreign policy doctrine” that would govern the American government’s response in these cases.“That said,” he wrote in an email, “abiding by the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations as to foreign nationals detained here in the U.S. would probably be a good start, and certainly would go a long way in ensuring that Americans detained abroad receive the Convention’s same protections.”That convention, among other protections, requires that law enforcement officials inform foreign nationals they arrest that they have the right to talk to their representatives at their nation’s consulates, that they be provided the means to mount an adequate defense at trial and that they be treated by the same standards as the citizens of the country in which they’re arrested.The United States ratified the convention in 1969, but human rights advocates suggest that there are multiple occasions on which foreign nationals have been convicted of crimes in cases that did not conform to the articles of the convention. During Rezaian’s detention in Iran, The Post’s lawyers noted numerous ways in which his trial did not meet Iran’s constitutional requirements, and he was denied the opportunity to communicate with consular officials from either the United States or Switzerland; Switzerland’s consulate provides consular services to American citizens in Iran.In recognizing Bay’s work at USC Annenberg and beyond, the PEN Center USA illustrated the rising importance of digital platforms in journalism. Bay has been an anchor for “Good Morning America” and “Moneyline” and a senior strategic adviser for Huffington Post.“A [journalism] school curriculum today must focus on digital platforms,” Putnam wrote. “Technology has changed how we consume the news, and the next technological advances will change it yet again. Virtual reality and immersive journalism appear to be journalism’s next frontier.”Rezaian and Bay will receive their awards at the PEN Center USA’s Literary Awards Festival ceremony in Los Angeles on Sept. 28.</td>\n",

       "      <td>A bill that would allow terminally ill adults in Maryland to take their own lives appears likely to fail in committee for the second straight year, its lead sponsor said Wednesday.With a vote expected Thursday, none of the four lawmakers whose support is needed to move the Death With Dignity Act to the full state Senate appears ready to commit to the measure, Sen. Ronald N. Young (D-Frederick) said.“I have a feeling we don’t have the votes to get it to the floor,” Young said. “I talked to several of the people who were on the fence, and got no affirmative answer from any of them.”The bill, which would allow doctors to prescribe a fatal dose of medication to patients who are expected to die within six months, has drawn strong support from advocates and families of the terminally ill but equally passionate opposition from the Roman Catholic Church, disability rights groups and others.Two members of the 11-person Judicial Proceedings Committee are co-sponsoring the legislation, while five members have said they oppose it. That means each of the remaining four lawmakers on the panel would have to vote in favor for it to advance. Two of them — Sen. Robert A. Zirkin (D-Baltimore County), the committee chair, and Sen. Victor R. Ramirez (D-Prince George’s) — expressed reservations Wednesday.“We don’t want people who are not receiving proper health care to see this as the option they have,” said Ramirez, citing testimony from bill opponents that poor people and the disabled could opt to end their lives early because options for medical treatment are too expensive or appear out of reach.Zirkin said he shared those concerns. He was troubled that no amendments have been offered to the legislation to ensure that it would not be used in an unethical way. “I have to make a decision on if it’s the right public policy,” he said.A third undecided lawmaker, Sen. Susan C. Lee (D-Montgomery), called aid in dying “a tough issue” and said “there are compelling arguments on both sides.”The fourth undecided lawmaker, Sen. C. Anthony Muse (D-Prince George’s), declined to comment.Maryland’s bill is modeled after a law passed in California last year following the highly publicized death of Brittany Maynard, a 29-year-old San Francisco Bay area woman with terminal brain cancer who moved to Oregon to commit suicide legally. A handful of other states also allow some form of assisted suicide, although a right-to-die measure failed in Colorado last week.In Maryland, a recent Goucher College poll found that 60 percent of state residents support allowing terminally ill adults to take their own lives. Young said the bill appears to have widespread support in the full Senate, and perhaps in the full House as well.But proponents of the bill said they knew they were fighting an uphill battle to push the bill out of committee, given the state’s strong African American and Catholic communities, both of which have historically been uncomfortable with assisted suicide.The Maryland Catholic Conference made defeating the bill its top priority this legislative session — joining with disability rights advocates to say the measure could open the door for mistreatment of the disabled, the elderly and minorities, and arguing that those groups already experience disparities in health-care access.“Legalizing suicide as a medical course-of-action will only serve to further erode the healthcare that vulnerable people currently receive, especially since it is much less expensive than continuing treatments,” said a statement distributed in Annapolis on Catholic Lobby Night.Lawmakers heard hours of emotional testimony on the bill during hearings in both chambers of the General Assembly. There were terminally ill patients who pleaded for the option to end their lives and caregivers who described the painful deaths of their loved ones. And there were religious leaders and disability advocates who argued that “every life” is precious and raised concerns about the potential for abuse.Proponents of Maryland’s bill have worked since last year to build momentum for the measure. They invited small groups to watch the documentary “How to Die in Oregon” (2011), about that state’s assisted-suicide law, and held “house parties” where they served refreshments and offered information about end-of-life options for the terminally ill.Several senators said they expect the committee to vote on the bill Thursday, and for it to fail to muster the six votes needed to advance. Young said the bill could just be quietly dropped from consideration.“Every demographic group supports the bill,” he said in frustration. “I consider this a personal choice. If you don’t like it, don’t do it.”</td>\n",

       "      <td>KIGALI, Rwanda — The man credited with transforming Rwanda from a nation stricken by genocide to a model of African development once told citizens that he would never “disrespect the constitution” by overstaying his term.So this fall, President Paul Kagame’s supporters did what they had to in order to keep him in power: They changed the constitution.Rwanda, which receives $100 million in U.S. aid every year, presents a significant test for President Obama’s push for democracy in Africa. As recently as July, Obama appealed to African leaders to step aside when their mandates expire and break with the continent’s history of strongman leaders.“Nobody should be president for life,” Obama said in the speech at the African Union headquarters in Ethiopia.Kagame, 58, is a former military commander who speaks with equal ease at Ivy League business schools and in his country’s poorest villages. He has overseen economic growth of nearly 8 percent per year and has won the friendship of philanthropists such as the singer Bono and former president Bill Clinton. But even as Kagame has garnered accolades, he has cracked down on his political opponents.Now, with Kagame increasingly likely to remain in office beyond 2017, when his tenure was due to end, Rwanda appears to have joined a slew of African countries whose leaders are getting around term limits.Within the past few months, the presidents of Burundi, Congo and the Congo Republic have either scrapped their constitutional term limits or indicated their plans to stay in office through what critics call irregularities. Human Rights Watch has dubbed it a time of “constitutional coups.” In countries such as Sudan, Uganda, Cameroon, Zimbabwe and Burkina Faso, leaders have remained in power for decades, often by jailing their opponents or rigging elections.Kagame’s supporters say Western calls for him to step down are inappropriate and misguided.“We don’t have the pretentiousness to tell France or the United States who should lead them,” Kagame told the French-language magazine Jeune Afrique in the spring. “The same principle should be applied to us.”In October, Rwanda’s lower house of parliament decided without a single dissenting vote to change the constitution to allow Kagame to run three more times. The Senate did the same last month . Depending on one’s reading of Rwandan politics, the votes were either a sign of Kagame’s overwhelming support or the fear he has instilled in would-be opponents.“Pressure from the ruling party and fear of publicly opposing Kagame have doubtlessly shaped the results of this process,” Human Rights Watch said in a recent report.Many Rwandans say that the country could unravel if Kagame leaves power without a clear successor and that term limits are not as important as national progress. It’s the same rhetoric that other undemocratic regimes have used, but Kagame perhaps has more to show for his tenure than other strongmen on the continent.The streets of this capital city are spotless. Technology start-ups are springing up in offices across the budding skyline. Tourists are streaming in to see some of the world’s last mountain gorillas, protected by a top-rate environmental agency.Although it is difficult to gauge Kagame’s popularity, he is no doubt beloved by many here. About 3.7 million people signed a petition asking him to remain in office.‘A very iron fist’Kagame grew up in exile in Uganda, one of hundreds of thousands of ethnic Tutsis who had faced discrimination in jobs and schooling in their own country, where Hutus are the majority. He joined the Tutsi-dominated Rwandan Patriotic Front, becoming an influential commander in its armed wing. After Rwanda’s 1994 genocide, in which 800,000 people were killed, most of them Tutsi, the rebels swept into the capital.Kagame went on to become vice president and minister of defense. He won the 2003 presidential election by a landslide and was reelected. His popularity in the West soared. In 2009, former British prime minister Tony Blair said he was a “visionary.” Bill Clinton called him “one of the greatest leaders of our time.”Still, when the likelihood of Kagame’s third term became apparent in June, the U.S. government issued a statement saying the country would be best served by “strong institutions, not strongmen.”It wasn’t the first time the United States has criticized Kagame. For years, U.S. officials have objected to his human rights record and his support of Congolese rebels, whom Kagame funded to pursue former Rwandan genocidaires outside the country. In a mostly symbolic move in 2012, the U.S. government cut $200,000 in military funding, citing Rwanda’s support for the guerrillas.“It has been largely an authoritarian government at the top, with Kagame going after his political enemies and adversaries with a very iron fist,” said Johnnie Carson, a former U.S. assistant secretary of state for African affairs.In 2010, one of the few opposition leaders, Victoire Ingabire Umuhoza, was arrested on charges of “inciting the masses to revolt against the government.” She was ultimately sentenced to 15 years in prison. Umuhoza had touched on one of the country’s most delicate issues when she suggested that Tutsis ought to be held responsible for killing thousands of Hutus during the 1994 conflict. The genocide is officially described here strictly as the mass killing of Tutsis by Hutus.Arrests of Kagame’s critics have continued, with the government claiming that it is defending national security.There is now only one political party that opposes the campaign for a third Kagame term, the Democratic Green Party. The group has a tiny, two-room office in a nondescript building in Kigali, with a cutout of Obama atop a cabinet. The party does not have any representatives in parliament.“When people are asked if they support Kagame, everyone says, ‘Yes, yes, yes,’?” said the party’s vice president, Karine Maombi. “It’s a joke. People are afraid to say they disagree.”‘A serious setback’For years, the international community has struggled to calibrate its relationship with Rwanda, as the country thrived, making efficient use of foreign aid, even as it was frequently accused of human rights abuses.Carson kept “analytical score cards.” In economic development, he gave Rwanda a 9 out of 10. But on domestic political issues, he gave the country a 2, in large part because of Kagame’s repression of his opponents.“I think that Kagame’s decision [to stay in office] represents a serious setback to continued democratic progression,” Carson said.But Kagame’s supporters say their nation is being unfairly grouped with countries in much different situations. In Burundi, for example, the president’s remaining in power for a third term is strongly opposed by a coalition of politicians and activists. Hundreds have been killed there in protests since April.“Unlike Burundi and Congo, we’re going through this in a very calm way,” said Jean Philbert Nsengimana, the minister of youth and information and communications technology.Although opposition candidates have won important, hotly contested elections this year in Nigeria and Tanzania, some of Africa’s most prominent leaders have held power for decades. Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe, 91, has been in power for 35 years. Sudan’s Omar Hassan al-Bashir, 71, has been president for 22 years. A $5 million prize given by the Mo Ibrahim Foundation to African leaders who govern well and then leave office at the end of their terms has been awarded only four times since it was announced eight years ago.Kagame was seen as part of a new generation of African leaders, and Western diplomats hoped he would take term limits more seriously. For a while, it appeared that he would.He said in 2010 that “it would be my failure” if no one succeeded him at the end of his second term. But now, the parliament has voted to allow him to seek one more seven-year term and two more five-year terms.The United States is among the few Western c</td>\n",

       "      <td>They may have the oldest bromance in recorded history, and you can watch them spar with a supernatural bull in Constellation Theatre Company’s bold and colorful, if somewhat over-solemn, “Gilgamesh.”Dramatizing the celebrated ancient Middle Eastern epic, this world-premiere production conjures up — among other mythic events — the forging of an improbable friendship between the title character, a swaggering tyrant, and a mysterious figure named Enkidu. As they wander through a spirit-haunted landscape in director Allison Arkell Stockman’s staging, the pals cross paths with the vicious Bull of Heaven. Gilgamesh gives a ferocious war cry, and battle is joined.A gorgeous capering puppet with glowing eyes and shimmering silky flanks, the bull gores Enkidu (Andreu Honeycutt), the horns seeming to sink in so deeply that Gilgamesh (Joel David Santner) has to pull the animal away by the tail. Weapons flash, and eventually the spooky cow dies. (Matthew McGee is the puppet designer, and Ashley Ivey and Manu Kumasi manipulate the Bull.) Exhausted, Gilgamesh and Enkidu fall asleep, side by side, on the ground. It’s the first time we have seen the swashbuckling monarch look vulnerable.The relationship between Gilgamesh and Enkidu — a relationship that mellows and humanizes the king — injects a current of poignant feeling into this visually snazzy piece of theater, the first full staging of a published verse play by the Pulitzer Prize-winning poet Yusef Komunyakaa and dramaturg Chad Gracia. “Gilgamesh” boasts the kind of design touches that have distinguished other Constellation offerings: Kendra Rai contributes resplendent bright-hued costumes for the divine and mortal characters, and musical wizard Tom Teasley has again composed an evocative, percussion-heavy score, which he performs live onstage.But amid the pageantry, the production gains valuable emotional ballast from the poised, cogent performances by Santner and Honeycutt. The former segues artfully from imperious thuggishness to rough-hewn cordiality to suffering stoicism. And as Enkidu, who is part-man and part-animal, Honeycutt radiates a regal mystique, endearing us to the character without overexplaining him.Enkidu, curled up on the ground, is the first figure we see on Ethan Sinnott’s elegant sand-colored set, whose cuneiform-peppered panels evoke the tablets on which the Gilgamesh legend was recorded as far back as 2100 B.C. After the Woman of Red Sashes (Emma Crane Jaster) lures Enkidu away from his wild existence, he teams up with Gilgamesh to loot the Cedar Forest, patrolled by the menacing guardian Humbaba (Jim Jorgensen, seemingly dressed in bark). After subsequent skirmishes with supernatural forces — including the sultry goddess Ishtar (Nora Achrati in stunning gold drapery) — Gilgamesh ventures, Orpheus-like, into a realm beyond death, seeking a recipe for immortality.Although stocked with arresting lyricism, Komunyakaa and Gracia’s text packs a little too much tidy moral into the mystical adventure tale. Adding extra earnestness to this production are the solemn, choreographed hand gestures the actors sometimes execute when concepts such as “dream” (a fist at eye level) and “God” (splayed fingers) crop up in conversation. Presumably, the device is intended to suggest the characters’ reverent, archaic mind-set, but the effect is ponderous. Overall, “Gilgamesh” lacks the humor that helped make another Constellation spin on ancient epic, “The Ramayana,” so exhilarating.Katy Carkuff does lend sprightly flirtatiousness to the character of Siduri, the “barmaid at the brink, between worlds,” who teaches Gilgamesh about love. In turns that are equally striking but more serious, Achrati, Carkuff and Kumasi embody a council of Elders: ominous figures in robes and metallic masks.By the time he returns to his kingdom, Gilgamesh has learned enough about loss, mortality and impermanence — not to mention friendship — that he could serve as a wisdom-dispensing elder himself.Wren is a freelance writer.GilgameshPoetry by Yusef Komunyakaa, concept and dramaturgy by Chad Gracia.

       "      <td>HONOLULU — The Obama administration has asked China for help in countering the North Korean cyberattacks as the United States seeks to respond to the financially costly assault on Sony Pictures.But Kim Jong Un’s regime insisted Saturday there was no proof that it was behind the hack. It called for an investigation of the case to be conducted jointly by North Korea and the U.S. government, saying that Washington “will face serious consequences” if it rejects the idea.Administration officials asked the Chinese Embassy in Washington in a meeting Thursday to block Pyongyang’s access to Internet routers and servers based in China, to expel North Korean hackers living in China and to pressure the Kim regime to end its cyberoffensive against companies in the United States, according to one official.Most of North Korea’s telecommunications traffic runs through China’s infrastructure, although some of it also is routed through Russia and North Korea’s own limited networks.The request was part of an effort by the White House to develop options for what President Obama has called a “proportional response” to the activities of which North Korea is accused.The cyberattack was apparently revenge for Sony’s planned Christmas Day release of “The Interview,” a comedy starring Seth Rogen and James Franco that involved a plot to assassinate the North Korean leader.The hackers embarrassed Sony by revealing internal documents, including e-mail messages. The cyberassailants also warned of a “bitter fate” for those attending screenings of the film, leading cinemas to cancel plans to show it. The studio ultimately decided not to even release it.“This is really provocative,” one senior administration official said of the cyberattack. The official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter, said the White House and the U.S. Embassy in Beijing are involved in the request for help from China, and that other options remain on the table in dealing with North Korea.The official emphasized that it is too early to say whether Beijing would be willing to help.“We have discussed this issue with the Chinese to share information, express our concerns about this attack, and to ask for their cooperation,” said a senior U.S. official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of diplomatic sensitivities. “In our cybersecurity discussions, both China and the United States have expressed the view that conducting destructive attacks in cyberspace is outside the norms of appropriate cyber behavior.“We have reached out to a number of our partners around the world to seek their support and cooperation,” the official said. “Several countries have already stated that this conduct is unacceptable.”The New York Times first reported on the overture to China on its Web site Saturday.The U.S. request to the Chinese puts them in a tricky spot, analysts say. On one hand, the Chinese want to cooperate with the United States on cybersecurity and cyberterrorism issues, but on the other, they do not want to alienate the North Koreans, their allies.“They have to pick between playing a greater role in keeping the North Koreans from doing malicious cyberacts or they have to annoy the Americans,” said James Lewis, a cyberpolicy expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.The Chinese pulled out of bilateral talks on cybersecurity this year after the United States indicted five People’s Liberation Army computer experts on charges of conducting economic espionage against U.S. companies through cyberspace.But while the Chinese military does not want to return to talks — it has said it will not cooperate unless the indictments are withdrawn — Communist Party and Foreign Ministry officials are seeking ways to work with the United States on some cybersecurity issues.Cyberattacks against South Korean banks last year also were routed through China, analysts said. “They have said, ‘We don’t have any knowledge of this. We’re not involved; we’re not supporting this,’ ” Lewis said. “But they also weren’t doing anything to stop this.”North Korea pushed back strongly Saturday against the U.S. allegations that it was behind the attack on Sony Pictures and said it would not engage in terrorist attacks “aimed at the innocent audience in cinemas.”“Clear evidence is needed to charge a sovereign state with a crime,” a North Korean Foreign Ministry spokesman was quoted as saying by the official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA).The U.S. government’s allegations reveal “its inveterate bitterness” toward North Korea, the spokesman said. As further proof, he cited leaked e-mails between Sony and the U.S. envoy on North Korean human rights in which the latter advised the company to go ahead with making the film.Specifically, the envoy, Robert R. King, who was not named in the KCNA report, encouraged Sony to “keep alive scenes hurting the dignity of [North Korea’s] supreme leadership,” the spokesman said.The movie contains a scene in which the Kim Jong Un character is engulfed in flames as his helicopter is blown up.The film has played into North Korea’s deepest fears that the United States intends to destroy it. The movie also came on the heels of a campaign in the United Nations to charge Kim and his officials with crimes against humanity for decades of human rights violations.“We will never pardon those undesirable elements keen on hurting the dignity” of Kim, the spokesman said.Fifield reported from Tokyo.

       "      <td>Minnesota is the best state for women in America.That’s according to the Institute for Women’s Policy Research, a nonprofit that on Wednesday published the final two reports in a sprawling seven-part series exploring how women are faring in the states. The “Status of Women in the States” series, an update on a set of reports from 2004, represents an ambitious attempt to quantify gender inequality in the states—and provide fodder for the national discussion.“The way politics are structured in the U.S., if you want to make an impact it helps if you have the data,” says Ariane Hegewisch, study director at IWPR. “So the purpose was to pull the data down to the state level at least to help people concerned about addressing gender issues to make their case.”Each state and the District of Columbia received grades on seven broad topics, derived from dozens of metrics and touching on virtually all aspects of the public and private lives of women, from employment and earnings to economic opportunity to violence and safety to reproductive rights to health to political participation.[Tennessee just passed one of the nation’s longest abortion waiting periods]In the end, Hegewisch says, the report found inequities remain.“As you can still see with the results now, when you look at policy and basic socio-economic indicators, trends are different for women and men and the differences haven’t really diminished very much,” she said. Even among women, racial inequality persists, she added.In the end, Minnesota rose to the top, along with a handful of states in New England and the West Coast. The states that scored lowest were in the South, with Mississippi and Alabama tying for the title of worst state for women.The dozen best states were chosen because each appeared in the top 10 in at least one of the seven IWPR reports and none appeared below the midpoint of all states on any of the reports. The six “worst” states were chosen because each qualified in the bottom 10 of at least one report and fell below the midpoint of all states in each report.[Map: The most distinct cause of death in every state]Here’s a look at how the states stack up, in each report:1. The best state for political participation: New HampshireThough one of the last, IWPR’s report on political participation is perhaps the most important: a more engaged female electorate means better representation of women’s interests across the spectrum.After analyzing how women fared in four areas — voter registration and turnout, representation in elected office and institutional resources — IWPR concluded that women in New Hampshire are most politically engaged, earning the state a top score of a B+. New England, the Midwest and the West Coast dominate the rankings, with three states in each region placing among the top 10 overall. Seven of the worst states for women’s political participation are in the South.There’s good and bad news in the report: political representation has generally improved for women, but they have a long way to go before achieving equality.A decade ago, women accounted for fewer than 1 in 7 members of Congress. Today, they account for nearly 1 in 5. But, at the rate of progress women have seen since 1960, IWPR estimates that women won’t achieve equal representation in Congress for another 102 years.Women have yet to achieve 50 percent representation in any state legislature and while six states have female governors, only 36 of the 2,300 governors have ever been women.2. New York: the best state for women’s work-family balanceThe other report released on Wednesday is new to the series: this one tracks how well states allow for a healthy split between work and family life, largely by looking at policies that facilitate such a balance.“There has been really increased awareness of these issues, of the need to explicitly address the barriers,” Hegewisch says.In their analysis, New York rose to the top. While it had the highest score, it, California and the District of Columbia each earned Bs. Indiana, Montana and Utah scored lowest, each earning an F. That conclusion is based on four indicators: policies on paid leave, dependent and elder care and child care, as well as the share of parents in the workforce with young children at home.The report also identified big differences by race. Just 51 percent of working Hispanic women have access to paid sick days, for example, compared to 65 percent of working white or Asian women. 3. Oregon, the best state for reproductive rightsOregon scored higher than any other in terms of reproductive rights, though it, six other states and the District of Columbia earned A-minuses. Ten states earned Bs, 20 earned Cs, 9 received Ds and four — South Dakota, which ranked last, Nebraska, Kansas and Idaho — flunked on IWPR’s scorecard.The grades were based on a number of variables, including: access to, funding for and political support for abortion; sex education; and whether a state imposed any of a variety of abortion restrictions.[Where reproductive rights stand in the states, in 6 maps]Reproductive rights advanced since 2004 in some ways and retreated in others. Generally, access to infertility treatments has broadened, as has access to abortion providers. (Just barely, though: the share of women living in a county with at least one abortion provider grew in 24 states, but shrank in 22.)Meanwhile, more states added abortion waiting periods—including Tennessee this week—while the share of pro-choice public officials shrank in more states than it grew.4. The best state for women to rise above poverty? MarylandWomen fighting to move out of poverty are better off in Maryland than their their peers in any other state, according to IWPR’s analysis of poverty and economic opportunity. The report looked at the share of women who: live above the poverty line; own a business; have health insurance; and earned a bachelor’s degree, we noted when that report was released:Those four factors were chosen years ago in an effort to “pinpoint how well women are doing in this area,” says Cynthia Hess, the study’s lead author. When combined, the four factors in the report paint a composite picture of social and economic autonomy for women across the states, with women in Maryland beating Massachusetts by a nose.The variables were chosen years ago by a committee of mostly academic experts assembled by IWPR to identify representative and consistent indicators. Since 2004, the situation for women in the states has improved on two counts and backtracked on two others, we reported:The share of women with a bachelor’s degree rose 6.9 points to 29.7 percent and the share owning a business grew from 26 to 28.8 percent. At the same time, the share of women living above poverty shrank from 87.9 percent to 85.4 percent and the share of those with health insurance shrank from 82.3 percent to 81.5 percent, though the latest 2013 data omits the impact of Obamacare.5. Violence and safetyThe report on violence and safety is the only one in the series for which IWPR did not calculate a composite score, because state-level data on the relevant issues is limited.The report focuses on a slew of topics, however, including prevalence of intimate partner violence, rape and sexual assault, stalking, harassment, teen dating violence, gun violence and human trafficking.As in the other reports, the analysis of violence and safety identified large variation by ethnicity and race. More than half of Native American and multiracial women report experiencing intimate partner violence at some point in their lifetime, compared to just 15 percent of Asian women, for example. Similar trends hold for psychological aggression.The continued prevalence of such violence, along with a number of other factors, underscores the need for further research, the authors of the IWPR report argue:At a basic level, this requires improving data collection in the area of violence and abuse by ensuring that survey data are availab</td>\n",

How is it that the FBI, which had sent out field agents to interview Tamerlan in 2011, did not recognize him in the surveillance photos and had to ask for the public’s help to identify him?This would be an important thing for the public to know, but it’s hard to see how it could help Dzhokhar’s case, so the defense may not want to pursue this question.2. Will the government tell us where the bombs were made?No residue of bomb-making was found in the Tsarnaevs’ apartment in Cambridge. Did the investigators ever figure out where the brothers made the bombs, and if anyone helped them? Prosecutor William Weinreb made no mention of this in his opening statement, so probably not.3. Who shot MIT police officer Sean Collier?The government says that eyewitnesses and a surveillance video tape place the brothers at the scene, but it is not clear which one of them had the gun and pulled the trigger. The defense says it was Tamerlan, the older brother.4. What actually happened on Laurel Street in Watertown in the very early hours of April 19, 2013?Weinreb’s description on Wednesday differed from earlier law-enforcement accounts: he made it sound like the big, chaotic gun fight in which Transit Police Officer Richard Donahue was critically injured by friendly fire occurred after Tamerlan was dead and Dzhokhar had made his get-away. Really? At least this would explain why two pipe bombs and one pressure-cooker bomb ostensibly thrown by the brothers injured no one (two more pipe bombs failed to explode) – because there were only a couple of people at the scene, and most of the police officers arrived later. But it would raise other questions. Among them: Why were police shooting after both of the brothers were gone?5. Why were the brothers driving in loops around Boston, Cambridge, and Watertown on the night of April 18?Weinreb said they were planning to go to New York in a hijacked car. But after they got the car – a Mercedes SUV – and moved their arsenal to it, they first ditched Dzhokhar’s old Honda Civic, then returned and got it, and started driving in two cars. Why?6. Will the defense manage to slip in a discussion of the 2011 triple murder in Waltham in which Tamerlan has posthumously become a suspect?It would buttress the defense case that Tamerlan was a monster and Dzhokhar had reason to fear him, but the prosecution is sure to try to exclude any mention of it.7. What will the Tsarnaevs’ imprisoned friends tell the court?Two college friends of Dzhokhar’s are awaiting sentencing or obstruction of justice, one is due to be sentenced for lying to investigators, and one more man, who was friendly with both brothers, is awaiting trial. The government has not alleged that any of them knew about the plot to bomb the Marathon, but all four are on the witness list – and there is reason to believe testifying may get them lighter sentences. They will probably be called upon to talk about Dzhokhar Tsarnaev’s radical beliefs – though the college friends’ earlier statements contain no indication that his views struck them as unusual.8. Will the government show that video that everyone has seen but no one has seen?The video ostensibly shows Dzhokhar Tsarnaev setting down a backpack with a bomb at the site of the second of the two blasts. On Monday defense attorney David Bruck said the video doesn’t exist. In his opening statement on Wednesday, Weinreb described what the jury is actually going to see: a surveillance video showing Tsarnaev arrive, carrying a backpack on one shoulder, then stop with his back to the camera and lower the shoulder – presumably out of range of the camera. The backpack at the defendant’s feet, he said, can be seen in a photograph. The question of the video, though, is largely theoretical now, since the defense is not denying that Tsarnaev set off one of the Marathon bombs9. Will Dzhokhar Tsarnaev testify?Defendants rarely do – and jurors are always instructed that defendants are under no obligation to speak – but if anyone could make a convincing case for his having been dominated by the older brother, it would be Dzhokhar himself.Related coverage:Boston Marathon trial opens with heart-rending testimony on attackOpening statements made in Boston Marathon bombing trialYou have not seen that Boston Marathon video</td>\n",

       "      <td>Your new car isn't just a car. It's a computer that relies on tens of millions of lines of code to run. But if a researcher finds a bug in all those zeros and ones that could let a criminal hacker take it over, do you have a right to know?That depends on who you ask.A bill being debated on Capitol Hill would levy hefty penalties against people who break into a car's computer system. But in testimony today, the Federal Trade Commission warned that could actually leave consumers less safe.\"We support the goal of deterring criminals from accessing vehicle data. Security researchers have, however, uncovered security vulnerabilities in connected cars by accessing such systems,\" Maneesha Mithal, associate director of the FTC’s Division of Privacy and Identity Protection, told a House subcommittee considering the bill Wednesday. \"By prohibiting such access even for research purposes, this provision would likely disincentivize such research, to the detriment of consumers’ privacy, security, and safety.\"FTC Commissioner Terrell McSweeny made a similar argument in a column published by Wired today. \"Moreover, tying the hands of white hat researchers will do nothing to prevent bad actors from finding the same vulnerabilities and exploiting them in potentially harmful ways,\" she said.But other parts of the government appear less sure about the value of independent research.In a letter sent to copyright regulators earlier this fall, the Department of Transportation said that publication of \"good faith research\" was an opportunity to promote collaboration between auto-makers and third party researchers. But the agency also said it is \"concerned that there may be circumstances in which security researchers may not fully appreciate the potential safety ramifications of their security circumvention acts and may not fully understand the logistical and practical limitations associated with potential remedial actions that may become necessary.\"Under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, people are generally prevented from getting around \"technological protection measures\" to access copyrighted material -- a provision automakers have argued should limit researchers and everyday people's ability to review the software in their cars since it is typically protected via digital means.Those restrictions, some digital advocates like the Electronic Frontier Foundation, argue have chilled research.The U.S. Copyright Office is currently considering two proposed exemptions to the law: One for vehicle owners who want to be able to tinker with or repair them and another for security research.General Motors, one of the world's largest auto makers, opposed the research exemption last year: \"Even when such efforts are undertaken by well-intentioned researchers, wider distribution of such information provides third parties, both those with ill will and those with more benign interests, access to vehicles in a way that implicates safety and security concerns. Thus, if granted, the proposed exemption will likely result in significant safety and security challenges.\"However, GM now says its working on a formal process to work with third-party researchers who find digital flaws in their vehicles.And the Transportation Department noted its fears might be allayed if disclosure was limited to regulators and affected parties or if they could ensure automakers had \"adequate time for responsive actions\" -- presumably, figuring out and distributing a fix.In practice, that's what researchers who hack cars have done. For instance, when researchers Charlie Miller and Chris Valasek discovered major problems that could allow hackers to basically take over driving of Jeep Cherokees, they shared information about it with the car's manufacturer for nearly nine months while the automaker worked on a fix and didn't go public until that fix had been released.But there have also been cases when auto-makers have tried to keep researchers quiet.In 2013, a British court put a gag order on researchers who planned to publish research on a problems with the tech some luxury car-makers used to unlock and start vehicles. Volkswagen, which brought the case against the researchers, didn't come to a settlement agreement that let the research publish their work until earlier this year.While the researchers couldn't talk, London police said more than 40 percent of car and van thefts in the city last year were carried out without the owner's keys being present -- the vast majority apparently \"the result of organised criminals using key-programming devices to create duplicate keys for vehicles.\"That's the big problem: Even if researchers don't have the freedom to investigate or disclose them, cybersecurity flaws in cars will continue to exist — and malicious hackers might be the first ones to find them.</td>\n",

       "      <td>WITH THE presidential election over, supporters of better U.S.-Cuban relations are calling on President Obama, who won a majority of the Cuban American vote, to seek accord with the Castro regime. They forget the case of Alan Gross, the American development contractor who this week began his fourth year in a Cuban military prison.Mr. Gross, of Potomac, was arrested on Dec. 3, 2009, after he delivered satellite telephones to members of Cuba’s tiny Jewish community. He had been hired to provide the equipment by the U.S. Agency for International Development; the aim was to help Cuban Jews connect to the Internet.In 2011, Mr. Gross was convicted of crimes against the state and sentenced to 15 years in prison. There the now-63-year-old has remained, despite health problems that include a severe loss of weight, arthritis and a growth on his shoulder. His appeals to visit his gravely ill, 90-year-old mother have been denied. Cuban president Raúl Castro has repeatedly turned down proposals to release Mr. Gross on humanitarian grounds, despite visits from envoys ranging from U.S. senators to former U.N. ambassador Bill Richardson.The Castro government says it wants to repair relations with the United States, win the lifting of what remains of the U.S. trade embargo and attract investment from American companies. So why keep Mr. Gross in prison? The answer, unfortunately, is relatively simple. Cuba wants to swap its prisoner for five Cuban spies who were arrested in Florida in 1998. The network infiltrated a U.S. Navy base and anti-Castro groups and provided information that facilitated Cuba’s 1996 shoot-down in international airspace of two planes carrying members of one of the groups. Four U.S. citizens died. The head of the network was sentenced to life in prison after a 2001 trial, while others were given lesser terms. One is now out on probation.There is no equivalence between Mr. Gross and the five prisoners, as Havana itself acknowledges. It agrees the Florida prisoners were its spies, but it has never charged Mr. Gross with espionage. But Mr. Castro sees Mr. Gross as the leverage to spring his agents, whom the state propaganda apparatus portrays as heroes. More significantly, by arranging an exchange, the regime believes it can reshape U.S.-Cuban relations on its own terms, without having to make concessions on human rights.The Gross family has appealed to Mr. Obama to send a high-level envoy to Cuba and to do what is necessary to obtain his release. That’s understandable, but the administration ought to stick to its refusal to countenance such a bargain. On the contrary, Mr. Obama should consider new steps to punish the Castro regime for the continued imprisonment of Mr. Gross, and the administration should do more to raise his case in international forums.Better relations between Cuba and the United States must be conditioned on real steps toward democratization by Havana. But until Mr. Gross is released, they ought to get worse.Read more from OpinionsThe Post’s View: Cuba should free Alan GrossJennifer Rubin: Alan Gross, Castro and ObamaLetter to the Editor: How to free Alan Gross from Cuban prison</td>\n",

       "      <td>Colleges are putting the brakes on hefty price increases, but tuition and fees are still rising at a faster rate than the financial aid and family income needed to cover costs, according to two reports released Wednesday by the College Board.“Despite the moderate increases in average published prices, there were considerable increases in net tuition and fees over the past few years,” said Jennifer Ma, policy research scientist at the College Board and co-author of the reports. “These increases, combined with stagnant incomes for many families, raise concerns about ensuring educational opportunities for low- and moderate-income students.”Sticker price increases have hovered around 3 percent for the last three years, the reports showed, keeping in line with historical trends and the reversal of the soaring costs that marked the recession. But net prices for a college education are rising.Published tuition and fees for four-year public colleges and universities this fall average $9,650 for in-state students, a 2.4 percent annual increase after inflation. After taking grants, scholarships and tax credits into account, tuition and fees for local students at public universities average about $3,770. That so-called net price, though, climbs to an average $14,210 when room and board are added. Net prices continue to grow because sticker price increases have surpassed the grant aid that students receive.Meanwhile at private, nonprofit colleges, average net tuition and fees this fall was $14,220, up from an inflation-adjusted $13,340 last year. Including room and board, the net price rose from $24,980 to $26,100. Published tuition and fees at private schools crept up 3.6 percent, to $33,480 after inflation.Wages are trending up, but not enough to keep pace with the cost of college. Median family income grew at an average rate of 0.4 percent a year after inflation between 2005 and 2015, while incomes rose 0.8 percent between 1996 and 2006, according to the report.The positive news is that families are taking on less debt to cover the cost of higher education as the economy improves. Students and parents borrowed $106 billion in 2015-2016 to pay for college, down 14 percent from the peak of $124 billion in 2010-2011. Undergraduates last year borrowed 18 percent less than in 2010-2011. During the same period, graduate students took on 6 percent less debt — though over the past academic year, per-student borrowing among that group went up by $550.While sticker price increases have muted some of the gains in grant aid, there is far more money to supplement student and family resources. Grants constituted 55 percent of the funds used by undergraduates in 2015-2016, the highest level in recent years, according to the report. Students pursuing a bachelor’s degree received an average of $14,460 in financial aid last year, including $8,390 in grants, $4,720 in federal loans, $1,290 in education tax credits and $60 in federal work study.A report from Sallie Mae also showed that families paid less out of pocket for college last fall by taking advantage of more scholarships and grants to cover costs. Parents of undergraduates reported paying $1,100 less toward higher education expenses compared to the 2014-2015 academic year, according to the survey. Scholarships and grants covered 34 percent of costs, the largest percentage of any resource used to pay for school in the past five years.“The continuing downward trend in undergraduate student borrowing and the significantly higher levels of borrowing among graduate students are critical to understanding student debt problems,” said Sandy Baum, a scholar at George Washington University who co-authored the College Board reports.Graduate student loans accounts for a hefty portion of overall education debt, though far fewer people pursue advanced degrees than bachelor’s degrees. About 43 percent of graduate borrowers owed more than $40,000 in 2015, compared to 10 percent of undergraduate borrowers, according to the College Board.Still, graduate students and undergraduates who attend selective colleges have the lowest default rates on their loans. Default rates are highest among borrowers who leave school owing less than $5,000, according to the report. That finding is consistent with Federal Reserve data that shows students with small balances account for the largest share of defaults, often because they drop out of college, diminishing their prospects of finding work and earning enough to repay the debt.“The intense focus on the idea of a national student debt crisis distracts from a more important discussion about the students who actually are in crisis and keeps the struggle of these students in the shadows,” said Justin Draeger, president and chief executive of the National Association of Student Aid Administrators. “We should be targeting our resources toward finding solutions for the students who need it most.”People who earned a bachelor’s degree in 2015 left school with an average of $28,100 in debt. That number is a little lower than the $30,100 average reported by the Institute for College Access and Success, though both reports say that student debt is still rising. Debt levels vary across the country, with the highest concentration in the Northeast and Midwest, and the lowest levels in Western states.Want to read more about paying for college?

       "0     In one short paragraph, the new report from the nation’s top nutrition panel reverses decades of warnings about dietary cholesterol. Long one of the arch-villains of the American diet, cholesterol need no longer be considered a menace to the public health, the group said, as the Post previously reported.As the panel's report puts it: “Cholesterol is not a nutrient of concern.”Like few other issues, dietary cholesterol - that is, the kind you consume in eggs and other foods - and the fifty-plus years of debate over its role in heart disease shows the profound difficulties in reaching definitive conclusions about nutrition and the reluctance to withdraw public health warnings.The issue of dietary cholesterol, of course, is distinct from the level of cholesterol in the blood, which should continue to be monitored, experts say, because it has been linked to heart disease. According to research cited by the American Heart Association, blood cholesterol levels are determined by heredity or the consumption of foods high in saturated fats.The idea that dietary cholesterol represents a danger goes back at least as far back as 1961, when the American Heart Association warned Americans of the perils of consuming cholesterol-rich foods such as eggs, and liver.The warning about cholesterol was embraced by the first version of the government's \"Dietary Goals\" in 1977, and it has remained a fixture in them ever since. Indeed, when new nutritional labels were introduced in 1994, cholesterol was one of the nutrients that was called out.And as late as last year, the Food and Drug Administration asserted that “Current dietary recommendations continue to recognize the well-established relationship between consumption of cholesterol and its effect on blood cholesterol level.”The cholesterol warnings have been based on the idea that eating cholesterol-rich foods would significantly raise the levels of \"bad\" cholesterol in the blood, and that phenomenon would in turn lead to heart troubles.Whatever its merits, the theory had remarkable staying power, hanging on despite years of doubts from prominent scientists.The flaw in the logic behind the warning is that eating cholesterol doesn't much affect the levels of cholesterol in the blood, at least for humans, scientists have found.As the Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee concluded in its report today: \"available evidence shows no appreciable relationship between consumption of dietary cholesterol and [blood] cholesterol.\"What is remarkable is how uncertain the science was behind the longstanding warning.As far back as 1955, Ancel Keys, one of the key researchers in this field, could conclude in the Journal of Nutrition that repeated studies had shown that \"cholesterol level [in the blood] is essentially independent of the cholesterol intake over the whole range of natural human diets.\"Keys had done repeated studies of the issue. For example, in one experiment, 23 men doubled their cholesterol consumption, another 41 men cut theirs in half. Over four to 12 months, their blood cholesterol levels of both groups failed to show any response to the change , according to Keys.In 1977, as a Senate committee was published the first set of dietary guidelines - which called for limiting cholesterol- three on the committee objected, noting that the Canadian government had recently concluded that \"a diet restricted in cholesterol would not be necessary.\"\"Because of these divergent viewpoints, it is clear that science has not progressed to the point where we can recommend to the general public that cholesterol intake be limited to a specific amount,\" according to the letter from Senators Charles Percy(R-Illinois), Richard Schweiker(R-Pennsylvania) and Edward Zorinsky(D-Nebraska).The recommendation nevertheless made it into the final publication. \"I can't tell you why previous committees did not deal with this,\" said Marian Neuhouser, a member of the current panel.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
       "1     A hydrogen tank detonated Monday and injured one person at a Manassas weapons manufacturer, according to Prince William County fire and rescue officials.An air pressure vessel shot up though the roof of the building, which is near George Mason University’s Manassas campus and the county’s governor’s school, shortly before noon. The vessel then dropped back into the UTRON building at 9441 Innovation Dr. UTRON’s Web site describes research on site into high-velocity gun launch technologies for military clients.Patty Prince, a city of Manassas spokeswoman, said the injury has been described as minor.HAZMAT teams were investigating and other experts were evaluating whether the building was structurally sound after the explosion, said Kim Hylander of the fire and rescue department.

       "2     The world's worst portmanteau is back: Grexit.That's short for \"Greek exit,\" as in Greece leaving the euro. And it's once again a possibility now that the left-wing, anti-austerity party Syriza has won power in the latest elections. The risk, as I've said before, is that the rest of Europe is in good enough shape that Germany finally thinks it can let Greece leave, and Greece's budget is in good enough shape that it finally thinks it can leave too. Neither of them wants that, but neither of them doesn't want it so much that they'd do anything to avoid it—so both might call each other's, as it turns out, non-bluffs if Syriza tries to force Germany to renegotiate Greece's gargantuan debt.Cue the market freakout in three, two, oh, it's already here? Why yes, yes it is. Greek stocks fell 11 percent on Tuesday, another 9.2 percent on Wednesday, before stabilizing up 3.2 percent on Thursday. Three-year borrowing costs shot up to 16.9 percent. And worst of all, Greek banks collapsed between 30 and 45 percent in just the last week. That's enough, as we'll see in a minute, to make it much more likely that Greece leaves the euro.Now, as far as panics go, this one is pretty well-justified. That's because Syriza hasn't just taken a hard line against austerity, but picked the equally hard line, though right-wing, Independent Greeks as its coalition partner, ahead of less confrontational but more ideologically simpatico alternatives. The game of debt chicken, in other words, is very much on.But the weird thing about Greece's debt, as Dan Davies points out, is that it doesn't really matter. Greece, you see, owes €317 billion, or 175 percent of its GDP, but that might as well be eleventy billion kajillion euros—it's about as meaningful and likely to be paid back. Why? Well, the first thing you should know about Greece's debt is that 75 percent of it is held by the \"official sector.\" That's an alphabet soup of lenders that includes the IMF, ECB, EFSF, and European governments. And unlike private sector lenders, they don't care about maximizing their returns, but rather looking like they're maximizing their returns. That means that under no circumstance will they reduce the face value of what they're owed ... but they will reduce interest rates to almost zero and extend maturities to infinity and beyond. So suppose, for example, that you lent me $100 for 10 years at a 5 percent interest rate. If you were Germany, you wouldn't take anything less than that $100 back, but you might give me 30 years at just a 1 percent interest rate to repay it instead. That's still a big help.The good news is that Greece's debt payments have already been cut a lot. The bad news, though, is that Greece's debt payments have already been cut a lot—so there's not much left to do. Greece, economist Zsolt Darvas explains, only owes 0.56 percent interest on a big chunk of its debt, doesn't owe any on another for 10 years, and gets sent back all the interest it pays the ECB. Not only that, but most of its debt is already pretty long-term. That's why, despite its 175 percent of GDP of debt, Greece only has 2.6 percent of GDP of debt payments.So all they can do now is fiddle some more with the interest rates and maturities. Maybe turn 0.5 percent rates into 0.2 percent rates, and 30-year bonds into 50-year bonds. That's not going to free up a lot of cash, though. Maybe 1 percent of GDP. Maybe a little more if the ECB starts buying more Greek bonds as part of QE. This last part is actually pretty clever. The ECB can only buy a country's bonds if it owns less than 33 percent of them, but it owns 34 percent of Greece's right now. That means Greece should want to pay the ECB back right now, so that the ECB can buy more of its debt. After all, when the ECB buys Greek bonds from Greek banks, that turns debt that Greece had to pay interest on into debt that it doesn't have to. So, in Greece's case, QE trades debt payment for debt relief.This is a deal Europe could, and probably would, support. Indeed, even Finland's Prime Minister, who's been more opposed than most to debt forgiveness, has said he'd be okay with giving Greece more time to pay back what it owes. Europe's dirty little secret, though, is that more time will eventually become all the time in the world. Today's 30-year bonds with 0.5 percent rates will become tomorrow's 50-year bonds with 0.2 percent rates, and then, at some point, zero-interest perpetual bonds, aka debt that you don't have to pay interest or principal on, aka not debt at all. Everybody knows this, but nobody can say it, because German taxpayers wouldn't like hearing that Greece will never pay back what it owes, that everyone's debts will be thrown together when there's a United States of Europe. (Oops, pretend you didn't hear that). And that's why Greece's debt is pretty irrelevant. It's a big number that Greece can't pay back, so who cares how big we're pretending it is?Well, Syriza does. They say they want to cut Greece's debt in half. The only problem is that's not going to happen, and even if it did, it wouldn't help much. The question, then, is whether a deal that just cuts interest rates and extends maturities would be enough for them. Another 1 percent of GDP of spending wouldn't save the Greek economy, but it would save a lot of Greek people from extreme poverty. Syriza would have enough money to give food stamps to the hungry, healthcare to the sick, and electricity to people who can't afford theirs anymore, just like it campaigned on. So would this be enough? Maybe not. Greece's austerity is bigger than its debt payments, so just reducing those payments might not reduce its austerity as much as Syriza wants. That leaves one last question. Why is Greece, with 25 percent unemployment, cutting more spending than is absolutely necessary? Easy: Because Europe is making it.Greece, you might be surprised to learn, doesn't need Europe's money to keep its budget afloat anymore. But it does need Europe's money to keep its banks afloat. And that, as Paul Krugman explains, is where Europe's leverage comes from. It goes something like this: Not-so-nice banks you got here, be a shame if something even worse happened to them, if, you know, you don't do all the austerity we tell you to. It's an offer Greece hasn't been able to refuse, because if the ECB pulls the plug on the emergency lending its banks need, the only way Greece could keep its people from losing their money would be to print it. And the only way Greece could do that would be to leave the euro.But it's an offer Syriza thinks it can refuse. It just doesn't believe the ECB would really kick them out of the euro and risk contagion in, say, Spain, where a one-year-old anti-austerity party has surged to the top of the polls. Markets, though, aren't so sure. That's why, as you can see above, Greece's banks started falling right after it became clear there would be early elections that Syriza would probably win, and started free-falling after Syriza did, in fact, do so. And why Greek depositors are pulling their money out of banks at a record pace right now. Better to get your money out now, while you'd still get euros, than to wait and maybe get drachmas that wouldn't be worth as much.This is how the euro ends. Yes, with a bang, actually, and a bank run. This isn't how it was supposed to, though. It wasn't supposed to end at all. The euro, Barry Eichengreen argues, is irreversible, because even talking about leaving it would set off the \"mother-of-all financial crises,\" stopping you from doing so. But what if, Krugman asks, you're already having the mother-of-all financial crises? Maybe it's because, even though you say you want to stay in the euro, markets think your policies will force you out of it. Well, then there's nothing keeping you in, because you're already on the way out. (Freedom's just another word for no banks left to lose). So what we might get here is a failure to communicate. Europe might say, look, yo   \n",
       "3     The July 30 editorial “Polio jumps the fence” reached the reasonable conclusion that recent outbreaks of poliovirus among displaced people and security-threatened populations need to be checked. It should also have explored the basic issue. Polio, like smallpox, can be completely eradicated from the entire world. It could have been eradicated decades ago but for religious objections to vaccination in Pakistan and Nigeria. Displaced people have now carried the infection to other populations. In effect, these tiny pockets of zealotry are holding the rest of the world hostage, endangering many and forcing the use of resources that could be used to address other pressing health-care problems.

       "4     Congressional leaders on Tuesday said the bombings in Brussels underscore the need to accelerate the military campaign against terrorist groups and to boost airport security in the United States.Blasts that struck a major international airport and a metro station frequented by European diplomats put Brussels on lockdown Tuesday amid fears the attacks were carried out in retaliation for the recent capture of Salah Abdeslam, the presumed mastermind of the November Paris attacks.The Islamic State, also known as ISIL or ISIS, took credit for the attacks.[The Islamic State claims responsibility for the Brussels attacks]“Our nation stands in solidarity with the people of Belgium and we will renew our determination to prevent more senseless violence against the innocent,” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said in a statement. “Defeating ISIL, al Qaeda and its affiliates will require concerted action by the military, our intelligence community, and our international partners.”House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) also called for international cooperation against terrorist groups and sought to play down worries that Washington could soon be attacked.“We have reached out to the intelligence community and I have received some updates this morning and I have absolutely no reason to believe that there’s a threat here,” he told reporters.Some top lawmakers said the bombings should lead to a push to tighten security at airports.Sen. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) said Congress should use the pending reauthorization of the Federal Aviation Administration to create tighter screening requirements for Transportation Security Administration officers and aviation workers and to boost funding for tightening airport perimeter security.“You can never be too careful,” Schumer told reporters. “We have to look at what happened in Brussels and in Europe and, you know, tighten up even more.”House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) pointed out that a bill the House plans to vote on soon would require comprehensive security assessments of overseas airport security and better cooperation between the Department of Homeland Security and its foreign counterparts. On Monday night, the House passed a bill requiring the department to produce an annual scorecard of foreign countries’ border security efforts.After last year’s terrorist attacks in Paris and San Bernardino, Calif., Congress stiffened the requirements for participating in a popular visa waiver program that expedites tourism and short-term business travel to the United States. The House also passed legislation that would halt the resettlement of refugees from Syria and Iraq, the two countries with the largest Islamic State presence, in the United States, but that bill was blocked by Democrats in the Senate.Rep. Richard Hudson (R-N.C.), who wrote an early draft of the refugee resettlement legislation, said he hopes the attacks will spur the Senate to reconsider the bill.“Brussels underscores the need to be vigilant,” he said.On the campaign trail, Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump caused a controversy in December when he called for a temporary ban on all Muslims entering the United States following the Paris and San Bernardino attacks. The proposal drew rebukes from congressional leaders in both parties.On Tuesday, he again called for restricting entry to the United States without specifically reiterating his call for a temporary ban on Muslims.“I would close up our borders to people until we figure out what is going on,” he said in an interview with Fox News. He added: “We’re taking in people without real documentation. We don’t know where they’re coming from. We don’t know what they’re — you know, we don’t know where they’re from, who they are. You look at them and look at them from any standpoint — they could be ISIS, they could be ISIS-related.”Republican leaders did not comment on Trump’s demands. But some Democrats refuted the idea that barring the doors to the country would help.“I don’t think the answer is to keep people out of the United States,” said Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.), who was in Brussels for a security conference last week and left the city Monday. She added that the United States needed to embrace “more understanding and tolerance” to determine “how we can cooperate with people who may not be exactly like us to address [this threat] together.”Shaheen described the “heightened presence” of police and military guards on the streets of Brussels and in the airport that was attacked as noticeable in recent days. She was in the city when Abdeslam was captured, a moment she said seemed to bring “some closure” for locals and authorities in Brussels — a city that has become accustomed to living on heightened alert.But that closure was soon punctured by the attack, which Shaheen called “a despicable act by cowards” deliberately targeting “places where people will be. They’re targeting symbols of civilization … just as we saw with the 9/11 attacks in the United States and with the Paris attacks.”For the most part, lawmakers’ reactions to the Brussels bombings steered clear of political finger-pointing. But the chairmen of the House and Senate armed-services committees used the occasion to restate their grievances with the Obama administration for not giving Congress a written “strategy” to fight the Islamic State — and not doing enough to rout the extremist network militarily.“Time has never been on our side in this conflict, and the failure to recognize the urgent realities of the war against ISIL will carry a grave price for our nation and our people,” Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) said, calling the Brussels attack “sadly predictable.”[Brussels attack intensifies pressure on Obama to explain Islamic State strategy]House Armed Services Committee Chairman Mac Thornberry (R-Tex.) said the attacks highlight the need to beef up U.S. military budgets.“The world is growing more dangerous; we have cut our military too much; and it is up to the political leadership in this country to take the action necessary to enable our service men and women to defend American lives and interests,” he said.Kelsey Snell and Paul Kane contributed to this report.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",
       "5     America, please eat more fruits and vegetables.A new report by the Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee, which convenes every five years, says that the rest of the American diet is having devastating effects: about two-thirds of American adults are overweight or obese. And maybe worse, about half of American adults - about 117 million people - have preventable chronic diseases related to poor diet and physical inactivity, the group said.This dismal diagnosis is the foundation for the group’s report, which provides the scientific basis for the nation’s Dietary Guidelines, the advice booklet that will be issued by the federal government late this year.“I wouldn’t call it gloomy,” said Marian Neuhouser, a committee member from Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, WA. “I call it reality.”The committee's report amounts to a scientific update regarding what is known about healthy eating.For the first time, the committee is recommending that the government should consider the environment when telling Americans what they should eat, a move that could have a significant impact on the amount of meat people eat.It also, for the first time, addressed concerns about coffee, saying that there is strong evidence that moderate consumption is not associated with long-term health risks.The panel also reversed decades of warnings about dietary cholesterol, as The Post previously reported. For years, the Dietary Guidelines have advised Americans to consume no more than 300 milligrams of cholesterol a day, a warning that limited egg consumption for many Americans. The limit arose from the belief that eating cholesterol would lead to high levels of \"bad\" cholesterol in the blood. But, the group concluded, no such warning is necessary.[U.S. government: Cholesterol isn't as bad as we thought]\"Available evidence shows no appreciable relationship between consumption of dietary cholesterol and [blood] cholesterol,\" the report found.The bulk of the report issued today, which runs to 571 pages, outlines reams of scientific evidence about what's good to eat. And in terms of dietary advice, it can be summarized as follows:- A healthy diet is rich in vegetables, fruits, whole grains, low- or non-fat dairy, seafood, legumes, and nuts.- It is moderate in alcohol- And it is lower in red and processed meat, and low in sugar-sweetened foods and drinks and refined grains.The government has published dietary guidelines since 1977, and during that time, those guidelines did not avert what many nutritionists consider a dietary disaster -- the nation slipped into an obesity epidemic.\"In the past, we haven't been able to change the way people are eating very much,\" said Alice Lichtenstein, a committee member and nutrition professor at Tufts University. \"One of the major focuses of this report is, rather than nutrients, the whole diet.\"[So can I binge on eggs now? Here's what you need to know.]So in compiling the evidence on diet and health, the group took a different tack from previous committees. Rather than focusing on the health effects of individual nutrients, it focused on how entire diets affect health.The committee reviewed studies that looked for associations between diets and major diseases such as cancer, heart troubles and diabetes.With regard to what people ought to eat, their research turned up the most consistent evidence for the health benefits of fruits and vegetables. The evidence for the benefits of whole grains was only slightly less consistent.And with regard to potentially dangerous items, the group found \"moderate to strong evidence\" that higher consumption of red and processed meats, refined grains and sugar-sweetened foods and beverages are detrimental.Read more:How cholesterol went from 'public menace' to 'not a nutrient of concern'How many eggs a day is okay?

       "6     This month The Washington Post staff said a melancholy farewell to its beloved longtime owner and publisher, Donald Graham. Graham sold The Post to billionaire Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos in what many saw as a selfless and courageous act to save the newspaper, and all of us, from the agony of a slow, undignified decline and death. Bezos has pledged his resources to a long game of innovation and recovery.When newspapers say goodbye to high-profile staffers, they sometimes prepare a mock-up of Page One, with stories about the departed. These things are not always entirely reverent. When I left the Miami Herald to join The Post in 1990, the Herald made a page for me, emphasizing my penchant for risky, provocative “stunt” journalism. I still keep this page on the wall of my home office. The main headline reads: WEINGARTEN SHOCKS WASHINGTON — editor’s grand entrance to nation’s capital marred by Nazi gaffe. The doctored photo shows me entering a stupefied Post newsroom dressed as Hitler and sieg heiling.That sort of parting shot was an easy call, in my case; I’m a sleazeball. But what’s the right way to irreverently send off Don Graham, whom everyone adores? I have no idea. I can tell you only what I wrote. We all know about Don Graham’s famously self-effacing personality — his ritual washings of Post reporters’ feet; the time he donated a lobe of his liver to save the life of a copy editor’s terminally ill schnauzer; his insistence that his take-home pay never be higher than that of the guy at the Springfield plant who re-stocks the vending machine, etc.Similarly, everyone knows about Don’s charmingly homely and unpretentious sweaters (though few are aware that, in an act of monastic self-abasement, he knits them from his own nose hairs). And of course we’ve all admired the unusual way he atones for hubris every time his newspaper wins a Pulitzer: by eating a live cockroach.So I think all of us need to forgive Don for what sometimes happens in private, after hours. We need to understand the intense stress that the burden of maintaining an extraordinary public humility brings to a man born into the upper crust of Washington society, expected to behave like an avaricious, conscienceless plutocrat.So let us not judge Don for his infamous nighttime solitary orgies, writhing naked on piles of his family’s cash, cackling, “Mine, all mine!” Or that he sometimes buys yachts and then throws them away after using them once. Or that every year, on his birthday, he hires the New England Patriots to play the Green Bay Packers in his back yard.None of that makes any difference to us. To us, Don will always be the quiet guy on the edge of the crowd at every newsroom Pulitzer ceremony, smiling shyly, taking no credit, content to bask in the light of reflected glory, because he knows, in his heart, that anytime he wanted, with a single phone call and a signature on a check, he could have any one of us murE-mail Gene at weingarten@washpost.com.

       "7     NEW YORK – Last Wednesday afternoon, I interviewed New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio (D) in his office at New York’s City Hall. Here is a transcript of the interview, which is the basis of my Monday column on de Blasio and the city. My questions have been shortened and I have included some background on issues that might not be familiar to those who live outside New York. My thanks to Ross Tilchin and Jeremy Waldron for helping me put together this transcript.What are some of the lessons learned in tour first months in office?I think there’s a real, extraordinary level of opposition to change that goes to the heart of the matter. If you’re fighting inequality, if you’re talking about income inequality and other structural inequalities in this society, a lot of people take exception to that, and we did not foresee some of it manifesting the way it did. The good news is once you see it one time, you recognize it thereafter.I think the path that we’ve all been on is not sustainable and not healthy. The decline of the middle class, talked about a lot, but has to be understood very sharply. [It] is very mature and very physical for people. There is a real diminishment of their lives with no turnaround in sight, and that has to be addressed head on. And yes, that will mean changing some of the ground rules, but it has to happen for the good of us all.There will be a lot of opposition, and I think we’ve grown a little stronger coming to recognize the shape of the opposition, and feeling comfortable with our ability to grapple with it. I think there’s a related point, which is that while you have an opportunity to act, we’ve seen too many situations where there were delays that really undermine the ability to do something tangible in people’s lives.So, our theory of the case from the beginning was: Do a lot quickly and make a real tangible impact, basically, pre-K, afterschool, reforming Stop and Frisk. These are not theoretical moves. These are very tangible moves that affect people’s lives down in the grassroots and in the neighborhoods. … I’ve learned … that the merit of that approach is even greater than I might have imagined, and it actually perfectly fits the fact that that there will be intense opposition. Part of how you grapple with intense opposition is by creating real organic momentum, by actually doing something for people, and then they rightfully buy into it.Talk about your fight with Eva Moskowitz. [Note to reader: Moskowitz, who served on the New York City Council with de Blasio, is head of the Success chain of 22 charter schools. As the New York Daily News noted, de Blasio “blocked three Success charter schools from planned co-locations in [New York City] public school buildings while allowing five others to go ahead.”]It wasn’t a sweeping attack on her organization, either. This is part of understanding how the opposition is structured and how it plays out because, look, you’re talking about what I think was, at last count, about a $5 million ad campaign against us really over a few fairly small decisions that were consistent with everything we said we were going to do.So clearly it’s not just about that decision. Let’s look it in the face. There are a lot of other things going on. People funding these efforts have more than one agenda, and some of them may feel discomforted by the bigger changes we’re making.When the campaign was going on, this issue came up of course. Bloomberg was rushing to make a lot decisions on the co-locations of schools, taking not just charters, but also newer versions of public schools and putting them into existing schools. An idea that I’ve said from the beginning can be done properly just wasn’t being done properly. They were rushing. They were not engaging parents. A lot of times, a very unequal outcome occurred where the new school, coming into the building did very, very well [while] the school that had been there for decades, generations, was put at a disadvantage, it lost a lot of its rights in its own buildings.And parents were very upset. If your child doesn’t have the same options in their own school building because another entity came in, it’s a natural tension point. So, we said we’re going to review all the decisions because a lot of them were rushed. A lot of them were last minute by the Bloomberg administration — classic of any administration turning over, certain administrations try and rush at the end to put their imprint.We said we were going to review them all. We reviewed them all. Of the forty-five co-locations, we said thirty-six passed muster. We didn’t find, by our criteria, any tangible reason to turn them down. We found nine that were problematic. Six of the nine were public schools, three were charter schools. Of the overall number presented to us within that forty-five, seventeen were charter schools of which we approved fourteen. Eight were from Success Academy, Moskowitz’s organization, of which we approved five.So, again, accuse us of being logical. We thought, ‘Well, if we approved objectively after our own objective analysis as a new administration, we said most of the charters were acceptable, we found most of the Success Academy schools were acceptable, people would see that as balance.” Again, certain individuals, certain organizations didn’t, I think, want to see it as balance, even though it was.And the same thing with what I’ve said on the co-location issue. I said there needed to be a moratorium until we created a process that was more fair to parents. . . . Moratorium does not mean an end; it means a pause while something is changed and updated. So we’ve always intended to have a process for co-location that was more fair, but would allow for charters to co-locate. It’s always been the plan, it’s very publically been that. But that’s why I think what came at us had something to do with the narrow charter issue and a lot to do with other things as well.What kind of other things?I think the fact that we’re fighting inequality, again, certain people, ideologically, are discomforted by that. The fact that my central agenda item was a tax on the wealthiest New Yorkers to fund our pre-K and after-school initiative. I think a lot of folks of means didn’t like that, and some of them expressed it through this other issue.You didn’t get the legislature to enact the tax you sought to finance your universal pre-Kindergarten initiative, although the legislature enacted a five-year universal pre-K plan. How do you feel about that? [Note to readers: De Blasio originally sought to finance his universal pre-Kindergarten initiative with an increase in the top income tax rate for New Yorkers with incomes of over $500,000 from 3.876 percent to 4.41 percent. The tax increase was opposed by Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D). The New York state legislature approved five-year funding for de Blasio’s pre-K program but did not finance it with his proposed tax increase.]I believed and I still believe that the tax was the most reliable way to go about this. I thought it was fair. What became clear in Albany was the way to get it done was a different way. But we set a high bar. We said we don’t want an amount of money that won’t allow us to do this, and we don’t want one year’s funding, or two years funding, we need something that mirrors our original vision. Our vision was a five-year play out of this so we could really build to full-day pre-K for every child and after-school programs for every middle-school child and then sustain it.Once you introduce this new element to our school system, we need it for the future of our schools. Parents have every right to expect it. You can’t turn back. So the idea was we needed something substantial enough to achieve it and sustain it. The final plan passed in Albany actually was that. I think earlier on, it did not look like it would be that substantial and have that kind of time-span, but when push came to shove, and I give all the credit to the grassroots, we orga   \n",
       "8     Updated at 7:12 p.m.A truck dumped sticky cement on the road in the northbound lanes of the Third Street Tunnel, near New York Avenue, causing northbound lanes to close.D.C. police spokesman Hugh Carew said the accident happened at 4:50 p.m., and a crew is cleaning up the cement now so that the road can reopen. One lane reopened at about 7:10 p.m., he said.

       "9     Ice skating’s popularity boomed during the 19th and early 20th centuries due to a long string of cold winters in the Northern Hemisphere and improvements in the design of ice skate blades and footwear. A good supply of frozen ponds, lakes, and rivers across the northern half of the United States enabled people to enjoy ice skating for the cost of purchasing a pair of skates, which was as low as 25 cents in 1862.Looking back at sports in the 19th century, ice skating was one of the only sporting activities of the day that involved both men and women and people of all backgrounds participating in the same activity together. By 1866, ice skating’s popularity rose to the level that prompted Frank Leslie’s Illustrated Newspaper to proclaim that ice skating was the “National Winter Exercise” of the United States. Large gatherings of people, often well-dressed, would ice skate together on a large body of water which was frozen smooth by winter’s chill.Cold winters of the 19th centuryThe Little Ice Age was a period of cooling of the Northern Hemisphere that began about 1300 and lasted until 1850. Increased volcanic activity is one theory for what caused the weather to cool. The eruption of Mount Tambora in 1815 is responsible for the infamous “Year without a Summer” in 1816 which produced frost and freezes even during the summer months from Northern Virginia through New England and into parts of Europe. The resulting cold winters of the 18th and 19th centuries helped set the stage for the development of modern ice skating.Analyzing temperature readings from a diary recorded near Philadelphia, Pennsylvania during the early 19th century, it can be noted that the low temperature dropped below zero degrees roughly three times more frequently during the winters of the early-to-mid 1800s than in recent times. The weather data in the diary is not official, however, but trends can be surmised that the winters have warmed since 1800.After the end of the Little Ice Age, during the late 19th century and into the early 20th century, winters remained fairly cold overall and ice skating continued to flourish. Some may even argue that winters up until the 1980s were fairly good for outdoor ice skating from Virginia northward.We certainly know that this winter has not produced good outdoor ice skating conditions in many regions with unusual winter heat in Europe and record warmth in the United States.Ice skating historyThe first ice skates were made from polished animal bones and are were primarily used to help with transportation over ice. Poles were used by the skater for pushing across the ice since the bone skates did not have sharp edges which would allow the skate to be used for thrust. Bone skates go back at least several thousand years.By the 18th century, ice skates had metal blades which were mounted to a wooden platform that was then strapped to a shoe or boot. The first ice skating clubs were formed in Europe and figure skating and speed skating started to emerge as specialized forms of ice skating. The first instructional book about ice skating was published in London in 1772. Ice skating through the 18th century was primarily done by men, however, and skating was not particularly popular in the United States.The popularity of ice skating increased dramatically during the 19th century. Frozen ponds, lakes, and rivers were abundant during 19th century winters in many parts of the United States and Europe and ice skates began to be mass-produced, making them affordable to the public.When ice conditions were right, ice carnivals would be organized in cities like New York and hundreds of people would gather on the ice with skates and sleds. The frozen ponds and rivers would become a melting pot of skaters from many different backgrounds and income levels who often donned their winter’s finest clothing for the event.Ice skate designs improved during the 19th century. A skate with a fixed blade that was clamped to a shoe or boot was invented by E V Bushnell in 1848. In 1865, well-known figure skater of the day, Jackson Haines, developed a skate with a blade permanently fixed to the boot. Haines’ improvements to the ice skate made jumping and spinning much easier and safer than with the older ice skate designs. The sport of figure skating quickly developed. By 1908, figure skating was made an Olympic sport.Ice hockey also developed in the 19th century out of stick-and-ball games that were played on both land and ice. By 1875, organized hockey games were being played in Montreal, Canada and by 1910 the National Hockey Association (NHA) was formed which was later reorganized to the National Hockey League (NHL) in 1917. United States teams were added to the NHL in 1924, starting with the Boston Bruins.Ice skating during the Civil WarThe American Civil War was fought during a time when ice skating was very popular. During the winter months, when the soldiers were in camp, they would sometimes ice skate for enjoyment and to pass the time. One of the more interesting accounts mentioned how a regiment of Mississippi soldiers learned how to ice skate on the frozen Occoquan River near Manassas, Virginia during the first winter of the Civil War. The soldiers from the deep south had not experienced frozen rivers before heading north to war. Here’s an account from Captain E. Howard McCaleb of the 12th Mississippi Regiment:In December, 1861, we went into winter quarters at Davis’ ford, some six miles from Manassas, on the Occoquan river, in Prince William county, Va., and there whiled away the time drilling and doing picket duty until the middle of March, 1862. It was there we celebrated the anniversary of the secession of Mississippi, on the 9th of January. It was there that we first endured the hardships of a Virginia winter and learned to skate on the ice of the frozen Occoquan.When Davis Ford Road was straightened at the Occoquan River almost 20 years ago, the camp location of the 12th Mississippi Regiment was bulldozed. Uniform buttons, bullets, and one of the soldiers’ ice skates were recovered. A photo of the ice skate blade and uniform buttons is included above.Artificial iceDuring the 19th century, there were efforts to expand ice skating to indoor venues and to extend the season of skating. Because the technology of refrigeration of ice rinks had not fully developed, artificial ice was invented as a substitute for skating. The artificial ice was made out of hog lard and salt.Artificial ice rinks were built as early as 1844 and the surface of artificial ice was described as “convenient” for skating. Artificial ice fell out of favor primarily because the ice substitute smelled bad. In addition, refrigerated ice rinks were getting established by the end of the 19th century and into the early 20th century which rendered the lard and salt substitute obsolete.Figure skatingIn 1865, Jackson Haines invented an ice skate blade which was screwed directly into the boot. Using the sturdy ice skates, Haines introduced a style of skating that combined ballet and dance on ice and involved more athletic jumps than was possible with the older, clipped-on skates. He also was the first to accompany skating routines with music.Haines realized that his new style of figure skating was more widely accepted in Europe than the United States so he moved to Vienna, Austria and became famous as a figure skater. Today, Jackson Haines is known as the father of modern figure skating.A few decades later, other popular figure skaters like Irving Brokaw would follow Haines. Brokaw represented the United States in the Olympics in 1908 and his book, “The Art of Skating,” became well-known as the how-to-guide for figure skaters.Many different figure skating clubs existed during the the 19th century and into the early 20th century. In 1921, the United States Figure Skating Association (now known as U.S. Figure Skating) was formed. Today, figure skating is one of the most watched sports in America.Ice skat   \n",
       "10    Officials at Dulles International Airport will conduct an emergency exercise Saturday evening in a portion of the baggage claim area.The drill is designed to help airport and emergency personnel practice their response to an incident inside the airport. The exercise will begin at 11 p.m. Saturday and is scheduled to end around 4:30 a.m. Airport operations will continue as normal.The area where the exercise will take place will be closed off to the public. But people at the airport may see a large number of emergency vehicles parked outside the main terminal as well as volunteers wearing makeup and playing the role of victims fleeing the incident.Airports across the country hold such exercises on a regular basis to help familiarize their personnel with how to deal with an emergency. Past drills have focused on responding to a plane crash or runway fire. This is one of the first times that airport officials at Dulles have held an exercise primarily inside the airport.

       "11    The adolescent years are when people's bodies are supposed to start the ascent to their physical peak. Teenagers are growing like beanstalks. Their hormones are raging. They're eager for new experiences. By all accounts, this should be among the most active periods in a person's lifetime.Except it turns out it's not.In an eye-opening study involving 12,529 Americans ages 6 to 85, researchers mapped how physical activity changes over a lifetime. The participants, part of the 2003-2004 and 2005-2006 cycles of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, wore accelerometers, devices that measure movement, for seven consecutive days. For the purposes of the analysis, researchers counted all types of movement, not just exercise.The first thing to note about the results, published in the August issue of the journal of Preventive Medicine, is that physical activity appears to be at its highest at age 6. If you've ever seen a squirmy kindergarten class that shouldn't be a surprise.Vijay Varma, a National Institute on Aging researcher and lead author of the study, said that there has been a belief that physical activity gradually declines across the entire life span. But according to the new data, there seems to be a sharper-than-expected decline during childhood — starting in elementary school and continuing through middle school and high school. By age 19, the average American is as sedentary as a 60-year-old.“At 60-plus, many people have health issues that might cause a restriction in movement, but why is this happening at age 19? It suggests that the social structures in place may not be supporting physical activity,” Varma said in an interview.He theorized that the modern school day, which requires sitting for large amounts of time and where recess is often compressed into 20 to 30 minutes a day, may be partly to blame. There's also the issue of early school-bell times, which researchers have found lead to sleep deprivation.“The timing of school isn’t consistent with biology of when kids wake up and go to sleep,” he explained.Varma and co-author Vadim Zipunnikov, assistant professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, point out that the data shows that school-age children were the most active between 2 and 6 p.m., or after school.Another reason for the sedentary day is likely to be screen time. Studies about how long we spend parked in front of our TVs, laptops, tablets and phones tend to become outdated quickly because of the constant rollout of new technology, but the numbers have been consistently high — as much as seven to nine hours per day. While the American Academy of Pediatrics recently loosened its recommendations for screen time, almost everyone agrees that too much of it leaves less time for physical activity, which can lead to a higher risk of obesity and depression.Calling the end of adolescence a “high-risk time period for physical inactivity,” the study confirms that most children are not getting the minimum amount of activity — at least 60 minutes of a moderate-to-vigorous workout — recommended by the World Health Organization. Among 6-to-11-year-olds, 25 percent of boys and 50 percent of girls were not meeting the target. For adolescents ages 12 to 19, the situation was even more dire, with 50 percent of males and 75 percent of females falling short, the study found.The next surprise in the study involves people in their 20s. The data show activity levels go up during this period — and this is important because this is the only period when people are moving more. Varma calls this a “catch-up” period and believes this, too, may be related to social factors. While the increase in activity was spread throughout the day, there was a noticeable spike in the early morning as compared to teenagers. According to the study, “emerging adulthood represent a period of multiple life transitions, including initiation of full-time work, increased household responsibilities, and changes in family structure including marriage and becoming a parent.”As expected, physical activity starts to decline at around age 35, and that trend continues through midlife and beyond. That's consistent with previous studies and attributed to the wear and tear on our bodies as we age.The timing of physical activity showed that as children age, their physical activity moves later and later in the day until it flips after age 19 to more activity in the mornings.“These findings broadly suggest to us we really need to start looking at when individuals are being more active so we can home in on what is occurring,” Varma said, “and start to design physical activity interventions that might target those behaviors.”Read more:Fathers sing more to daughters and roughhouse with sons, study findsAs bike commuting soars, so do injuries.

       "12    Hurricane Fred, which formed over the weekend in the far eastern Atlantic, is truly one of a kind. Not only has Fred set the record for easternmost hurricane in the tropical Atlantic Ocean, it prompted the very first hurricane warning for the Cape Verde Islands and has provided the first satellite view of a hurricane in the region since weather satellites were launched into space in the early 1960s.Hurricane Fred was born from Tropical Depression Six, which formed early Sunday morning just west of the coast of Africa. The system was quickly upgraded to Tropical Storm Fred, remarkably far east in the Atlantic. Then on Sunday night, forecasters at the National Hurricane Center saw enough strength in Fred to make it the second hurricane of the 2015 season, which also made it the easternmost hurricane formation on record in the Atlantic Ocean.Sort of. A slight qualifier is needed: Fred now holds the record for the easternmost hurricane formation in the tropics. Looking back through the annals, just 11 hurricanes formed east of 30 degrees west, and of those, 10 were in the deep tropics (classic “Cape Verde” hurricane formations). Back in 2005, Hurricane Vince briefly reached hurricane intensity while tracking toward Portugal and was further east than Fred when it did so. It was also much farther north, and outside the tropics. These records extend back to 1851.[In new record, three Cat 4 hurricanes spin simultaneously in Pacific]The other 10 storms — the classic Cape Verde hurricanes in the tropics — quickly recurved to the north, but Hurricane Fred is the first to actually pass over the Cape Verde Islands as a hurricane.Like the other storms shown on this map above, Hurricane Fred is forecast to track to the northwest. On Monday morning, Fred’s peak winds were 85 mph, estimated from satellite, and the storm was moving northwest at 12 mph.Two more firsts from Hurricane Fred: for first time ever, the Cape Verde Islands are under a hurricane warning. It’s also the first time we have a satellite image of a hurricane over the islands. The only other time a hurricane formed over the islands was in 1892 — long before the satellite era.Although environmental conditions favor Fred to strengthen on Monday, a combination of factors will weaken the hurricane over the next few days, including drier air, cooler water temperatures and increasing wind shear, which acts to tear tropical cyclones apart.Hurricane Fred formed from what we call an African easterly wave — an area of low pressure that moves west off the coast of Africa in the trade winds that can serve as the seed for hurricane formation. Interestingly, for easterly waves to make the long journey across the Atlantic Ocean and become a threat to land, they must remain relatively weak at first to avoid getting steered northward through weaknesses in the vast area of high pressure that tends to dominate the Atlantic in the summer.The current model analysis of the mid-tropospheric steering winds shows this area of high pressure — the subtropical ridge (below). The gray streamlines show the high-level winds that steer stronger storms. Weaker storms are steered by winds lower in the atmosphere, thus they are able to make it farther west toward North America.Looking at the seasonal activity so far, Hurricane Fred is the season’s sixth named storm and formed on Aug. 30. The average date for the formation of the sixth storm is Sept. 7. The second hurricane of the 2015 season formed on Aug. 31, compared to the average of Aug. 29. While those dates look somewhat “average,” the short duration of those storms means that the total activity for the season is still well below average for this date at just around 58 percent — typical for a strong El Niño, which tends to decrease hurricane activity in the North Atlantic.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",
       "13    LONDON — The European Union began a push Monday for U.N. authorization to deploy military force in the Mediterranean to stop migrant smugglers, even as a proposal to more evenly share the burden of refugees foundered amid intra-European divisions.At U.N. headquarters in New York on Monday, E.U. foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini told the Security Council that the unprecedented flow of migrants seeking to reach Europe by crossing the Mediterranean has necessitated “an exceptional response.”“We cannot do it alone. This has to be a common global effort. That’s why we count on your support to save lives and dismantle criminal organizations that are exploiting people’s desperation,” Mogherini told the 15-nation council.The E.U. proposal would allow the bloc to deploy military force to seize and destroy smugglers’ ships before they take on their human cargo.E.U. leaders see the program as an essential step to curb the dangerous crossings, which have left 1,800 people dead this year as the packed and poorly maintained ships have sunk, run aground or overturned on the high seas. The death toll is 20 times as high as it was at this time last year.But it is unclear whether the E.U. can win Security Council support. Russia has said it opposes any attempt to destroy smugglers’ ships, arguing that the owners in many cases do not know the purpose for which the vessels are being used. Authorities in Libya, the anarchic and divided nation that is the primary source of migrant smuggling, have been either cool to the idea or openly hostile.Rights groups, meanwhile, say that a focus on military action will not solve the crisis, and may make it worse. Amnesty International released a report Monday that described horrendous living conditions for migrants in Libya and concluded that military efforts would “effectively contribute to migrants and refugees being trapped in Libya and expose them to a risk of serious human rights abuses.”The group urged Tunisia and Egypt to open their borders to migrants seeking an escape from Libya, allowing them a safer route out than the one by sea.The E.U. has been roundly criticized for not doing enough to stem the crisis, which is being fed by an exodus of people from Africa and the Middle East fleeing war, poverty and oppression. An Italian-run search-and-rescue mission estimated to have saved more than 100,000 lives was canceled last year. After more than 800 people died in a single shipwreck last month, E.U. officials voted to triple funding for a new maritime patrol mission, though it remains more limited in scope than its predecessor.Meanwhile, an E.U. proposal to more evenly distribute asylum-seekers across Europe appeared to be in trouble Monday, even before it is due to be officially unveiled.The European Commission is expected to release the plan on Wednesday. It calls for establishing E.U.-wide quotas that would dictate the minimum number of asylum-seekers accepted by each of the union’s 28 members. The idea is to ease the burden on front-line states along Europe’s southern periphery, which are suffering under the strain of the tens of thousands of migrants seeking entry. The proposal is strongly backed by those countries and by Germany, which registers more asylum applications than any other nation in Europe.But it has been vigorously opposed by several East European nations, as well as by Britain, where the Conservative government is under intense pressure to limit immigration.A British government spokesman, speaking Monday under customary rules of anonymity, cited previous statements by Prime Minister David Cameron that Britain “would be playing its role in tackling the current crisis in the Mediterranean but that our focus would be on saving lives, not offering people asylum in the U.K.”Read more:U.N. estimates up to 850 migrants perished in capsized boat off LibyaWhy the Mediterranean migrant disaster is a problem for Israel, tooAmid flood of refugees to Europe, Italy opens a back door                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",
       "14    With the first presidential debate in the books, here's a look at some key facts and figures that matter from Wednesday night's showdown between President Obama and Mitt Romney: * 3 (Number of minutes more that Obama spoke): CNN ran a clock tracking the total time each candidate spoke during the debate. By its count, Obama spoke for about three minutes more than Romney. Considering that most of the post-debate analysis suggested Romney had the upper hand Wednesday night, it might come as a surprise that Obama actually spoke longer. But Romney kept his responses concise -- a reminder that it candidates can say more with less in debate settings.* 29 (Number of times candidates mention \"middle-class\" or \"middle-income\"): Obama mentioned the words 17 times, and Romney made 12 references. Going into the debate, the burden was on Romney to convince voters he could empathize with average Americans, especially following his \"47 percent\" comment. He delivered, with a memorable line early in the debate; \"Middle-income Americans have seen their income come down by $4,300,\" said Romney \"This is a tax in and of itself. I will call it the economy tax.\"* 52 (Number of times the word \"Medicare\" was uttered): Reminders that disagreements over the future of entitlements remain a central focus in this campaign were everywhere Wednesday, as Obama hit Romney over his plan to revamp Medicare and Romney noted the cuts to the program the president's federal health care law caused. * 0 (Number of times Romney's \"47 percent\" comment came up): Obama notably didn't bring it up, even as his campaign has been running scads of ads hitting Romney over his remarks at a May fundraiser. That doesn't mean Obama won't bash Romney on it at a future debate, but it perhaps does signal that the incumbent didn't want to appear too aggressive (or political) in the first debate. * 2 (Number of times \"leadership\" was raised by the candidates): Each candidate weighed in once on the crucial question of what leadership actually means. Here's what they said: Obama:\"And so part of leadership and governing is both saying what it is that you are for, but also being willing to say no to some things. And I’ve got to tell you, Governor Romney, when it comes to his own party during the course of this campaign, has not displayed that willingness to say no to some of the more extreme parts of his party.\"Romney:\"And Republicans and Democrats both love America. But we need to have leadership -- leadership in Washington that will actually bring people together and get the job done and could not care less if -- if it’s a Republican or a Democrat. I’ve done it before. I’ll do it again.\"

       "15    A Sumatran tiger that fatally attacked a zoo employee in New Zealand won't be euthanized, officials announced Monday.The male tiger, named Oz, killed Hamilton Zoo curator Samantha Kudeweh on Sunday. In a news release about the euthanasia decision, Lance Vervoort, Hamilton city council's general manager community, said zoo officials believe the tiger's attack was \"in line with his natural instincts.\"\"We're aware there is a lot of interest and speculation around how we manage Oz now, and I want to assure the public and zoo supporters that he will not be put down,\" Vervoort said in the statement.\"Although there is an inherent risk for zoo professionals who manage big cats like Oz, there is no wider ongoing risk. There is no reason for us to put Oz down.\"Oz is one of five Sumatran tigers at Hamilton Zoo, which will remain closed until Thursday. Visitors to the facility will be able to observe some of the its tigers then, though officials haven't decided whether Oz will be among them.\"This is our call, and the decision on Oz rested solely with us,\" Vervoort said in the release, which noted that government officials have also been notified. \"Oz is a significant animal for his species.\"Sumatran tigers like Oz are considered a \"critically endangered\" species. It's estimated that fewer than 400 of the tigers are surviving in the wild, according to the World Wildlife Fund.In the news release, Vervoort called Oz \"vital\" to the ongoing conservation breeding program for the species.The zoo staffer who was killed, Samantha Kudeweh, was described as a 43-year-old mother of two, who had a considerable amount of experience in her field. Her job at Hamilton involved figuring out which animals the facility should take in and how to care for them, according to her biography on zoo's Web site.The Sydney Morning Herald reported that emergency crews responded to the attack, which is still under investigation, late Sunday morning. According to the newspaper:Senior Sergeant Juliet Burgess, from the Waikato District Command Centre, said \"sadly the staff member who was attacked by the tiger has died at the scene\".\"This is a tragic incident,\" she said.\"It is too early to determine exactly what's happened.\"Officials are \"firmly\" focused on “supporting Samantha’s family, the zoo team, and mak[ing] sure we conduct thorough and complete investigations into this tragic incident,\" Vervoort said in the statement.Read more:Mauling, escapes and abuse: 6 small zoos, 80 sick or dead animalsCubs of a euthanized grizzly that killed a Yellowstone hiker will get a new homeIndiana woman wants to be laid to rest with her German shepherd.

       "16    The Food and Drug Administration announced Friday that it is banning the use of several common ingredients in antibacterial soaps and washes. It also said such products were no more effective than conventional soap and water in preventing illnesses and may pose health risks.The rule applies to 19 active ingredients -- including the most common, triclosan and triclocarban -- in liquid soaps, bar soaps and other items. Manufacturers will have one year to remove the ingredients from their products or to take them off the market, the agency said.Triclosan typically is used in liquid antibacterial soaps, while triclocarban is used in bar soaps.\"Consumers may think antibacterial washes are more effective at preventing the spread of germs, but we have no scientific evidence that they are any better than plain soap and water,” said Janet Woodcock, director of the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, said in a statement. “In fact, some data suggests that antibacterial ingredients may do more harm than good over the long-term.”Theresa Michele, FDA's director of the division of nonprescription drug products, said in a call with reporters that the \"vast majority\" of the more than 2,000 antibacterial products on the market contain at least one of the banned ingredients.She said the agency had asked manufacturers for data showing that the long-term use of the ingredients was safe, as well as evidence that the antibacterial products were more effective than soap and water in curbing the spread of illnesses and infections. But she said the companies either didn't provide the data or the material submitted wasn't convincing.An industry group that represents makers of cleaning products disputed that, saying manufacturers had submitted the required information. \"The FDA already has in its hands data that shows the safety and effectiveness of antibacterial soaps,\" the American Cleaning Institute said in a statement. \"Manufacturers are continuing their work to provide even more science and research to fill data gaps identified by FDA.\"The association added that antibacterial soaps and washes \"continue to be safe and effective products for millions of people every single day.\"The FDA's final rule does not affect consumer hand sanitizers, wipes or antibacterial products used in hospitals and other health-care settings. In June, the agency requested data on the safety and effectiveness of certain ingredients in those products, but emphasized it was not barring any of the items at that time.The agency issued a proposed rule in 2013 on antibacterial soaps and washes after data suggested long-term exposure to certain ingredients could cause bacterial resistance and unanticipated hormonal effects.Ken Cook, co-founder and president of Environmental Working Group, praised the FDA decision, saying that the group has been pressing for such action for a decade. “This decision by the FDA is a huge victory on behalf of human health and the environment,” he said.Michele said some manufacturers, including Johnson & Johnson and Procter & Gamble, have already taken steps to phase out use of some of the banned ingredients.The FDA also said that, in response to industry requests, it would defer for a year making a decision on three additional ingredients used in consumer wash products – benzalkonium chloride, benzethonium chloride and chloroxyleno -- to allow manufacturers to submit data to the agency.Read more:The chemistry of deodorantThe FDA takes another step to fight the opioid epidemicHPV

       "17    Raising the flag at the U.S. Embassy in Havana on Aug. 14 was a historically symbolic act, but equally symbolic were the absence of dissidents and the failure to talk about Cuba’s repressive regime at this public moment. The 45-minute ceremony illustrated everything that is wrong with Washington’s Cuba policy.Americans and Cubans who have wanted for decades to hold the island’s dictatorship accountable for its human rights crimes absorbed a tough blow. But if the Obama administration won’t give them the right Cuba policy, Congress can award them an important and symbolic concession: Rub a reminder of the regime’s brutality in its face, every day, by renaming the street where its embassy stands in D.C. after one of its victims, the slain opposition leader Oswaldo Payá.We all want a free, democratic and prosperous Cuba at peace with the United States. But this is not what Fidel and Raúl Castro want. Raul has made it clear that Cuba will remain under the control of the Communist Party and will not change the nature of the regime. As Josefina Vidal, director of U.S. affairs for the Cuban Foreign Ministry, put it: “Decisions on internal matters are not negotiable and will never be put on the negotiating agenda.” This is why the Cuban government refused to offer any meaningful political or economic reforms that might loosen its stranglehold on power, such as democratic elections or the release of all prisoners of conscience.Despite good intentions, the U.S. policy shift morally and financially bolsters the Communist Party and disheartens people — both here and in Cuba — who have fought for freedom and prosperity. America’s recognition of the Castro regime legitimizes the party’s rule and makes continuity of party control more, not less, likely after Raul’s retirement or death. Victims of the Castro regime feel they have lost their staunchest ally, the United States. During an audience with Congress, dissident Jorge Luis Garcia Pérez — commonly known as Antúnez — said the majority of Cuba’s dissidents consider the negotiations between Washington and Havana a betrayal that threatens Cuban people’s aspirations for freedom.People who oppose the rapprochement appear powerless. Easing the embargo bails out the party by letting it broker deals with U.S. corporate investors while choosing which Cubans get to do business with Americans. Tourism dollars coming from the United States will open a new revenue stream for the Cuban military, which owns the largest hotel conglomerate in Latin America and the Caribbean and most of the hotels on the island. Its parent company is run by Castro’s son-in-law, Luis Alberto Rodriguez López-Callejas.The monopoly of power and money that senior Communist Party members enjoy is maintained by repressive measures against ordinary Cubans who dare challenge the ongoing tyranny. According to Amnesty International, Cuba still stifles “freedoms of expression, association and assembly.” The rights group’s investigations reveal that, in the past year, “the number of short-term arrests increased sharply and politically motivated criminal prosecutions continued.” According to a 2013 report by Human Rights Watch, Cuba still condones beatings and arbitrary arrests of its political opponents.Although U.S. Secretary of State John F. Kerry noted last week in Havana that rapprochement “doesn’t mean that we should or will forget the past,” he failed to mention the injustices and the victims of Cuba’s Communist Party. The Castro regime is responsible for the deaths of about 10,000 Cubans. He ignored the dozens of political prisoners still held captive today. These artists, journalists, scholars, religious leaders and dissidents are in prison because their creativity, cause or conscience is deemed a threat by the Castro regime — the longest-running military dictatorship in the Western Hemisphere.To keep the memory of the regime’s victims alive, Congress can rename Washington’s 16th Street Northwest, where the newly reopened embassy sits. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) introduced a bipartisan bill to rename it for Payá, an activist who was expelled from the state-run university in 1972 for practicing Christianity. (Cuba does not condone the free expression of religion.) Payá went on to become one of the most prominent activists for democratization in Cuba and one of the biggest irritants to the Castro regime. You could consider him the Václav Havel of Cuba.On July 22, 2012, Payá was killed in a car accident in the island’s Granma province under mysterious circumstances. The Human Rights Foundation, which conducted an examination of the case, concluded this year that “evidence, which was deliberately ignored, strongly suggests that the events of July 22, 2012, were not an accident, but instead the result of a car crash directly caused by agents of the state.”Renaming the Cuban Embassy’s D.C. address as No. 1 Oswaldo Payá Way would not reverse President Obama’s decision to restore diplomatic relations with Cuba, but it would be a visible reminder that the United States supports the hopes and aspirations of Cuba’s dissidents, too.There is precedent for such a move. In 1984, the U.S. government renamed the street in front of the Russian Embassy for the famed Soviet dissident Andrei Sakharov. The message that the U.S. government intended to send was that we remember those still struggling against oppression and despair in an imprisoned nation, even if we engage in open diplomacy with its government.Cuba could retaliate, of course, by naming the street in front of the newly reopened U.S. Embassy in Havana for the late Venezuelan leader Hugo Chávez or whistleblower Edward Snowden or revolutionary Che Guevara or one of the 70 fugitives from U.S. law still harbored by the regime. But that decision would cast into even sharper relief our governments’ differing values.Neither peaceful relations with Cuba nor a brighter future for the Cuban people will be achieved by ignoring the bloody and ongoing abuses of the Castro regime. This is how to remember them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
       "18    Tropical Cyclone Hudhud came ashore in India near the city of Visakhapatnam on Sunday with wind speeds over 100 mph and torrential rain, killing at least eight people in the states of Andhra Predesh and Orissa.According to the Associated Press, at least 400,000 people were evacuated ahead of the storm, and damage in Visakhapatnam was significant:Visakhapatnam, one of the largest cities in southern India and a major naval base, bore the brunt of Hudhud’s fury. Television footage showed downed electrical poles, uprooted trees and debris strewn in the streets. Train and cellphone services were disrupted. Electricity was disconnected in parts of Andhra Pradesh to avoid electrocutions, said Arvind Kumar, a relief and rescue official.Images of the the airport in Visakhapatnam posted to social media shows major damage as a result of the storm: Tropical Cyclone Hudhud went through a period of rapid intensification as it approached the India coast, peaking at the equivalent of a category 4 hurricane with winds of 135 mph, though there is some disagreement on the exact intensity of the cyclone at the time of landfall.The India Meteorological Department says Hudhud made landfall with winds of 109 mph, and India’s Firstpost is praising the department for its exemplary forecast, saying it “has no peer when it comes to forecasting cyclonic storms in the Indian seas.” However, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center analyzed the storm at around 132 mph at the time of landfall. In an interview with the BBC, N Yuvaraj, a senior district official in Visakhapatnam, suggested that wind speeds in the city were closer to JTWC’s forecast. “We had this cyclone hitting us at around 10:25 Indian Standard Time (04:55 GMT),” he said. “And at that point we had a wind speed of more than 205km/h,” which is around 127 mph. It is unclear if these wind speeds were sustained or gusts.Much of the confusion around landfall intensity likely stems from the disagreement between the measuring techniques employed by the different forecasting organizations. While the Joint Typhoon Warning Center uses a widely recognized standard of one-minute sustained winds, the India Meteorological Department uses three-minute sustained winds, making verification between the forecast agencies difficult, especially when local observation data is sparse, and storm-related power outages are widespread.In any case, Hudhud was a powerful, deadly cyclone at landfall. Weather Underground’s director of meteorology Jeff Masters suggests the damage will probably end up looking similar to that of Tropical Cyclone Phailin in 2013:One-minute resolution wind observations from Visakhapatnam showed a peak sustained wind of 73 mph at 9:44 am local time, with a peak gust of 119 mph at 10:30 am. The station stopped reporting data at that time. Communications are out to much of the most severely affected regions, and I expect Hudhud’s eventual toll will be similar to that of Category 4 Tropical Cyclone Phailin, which killed 45 people and did $700 million in damage in October 2013 to an area of India’s coast just north of where Hudhud hit.While Hudhud has moved inland away from the coast on Monday, Andhra Predesh and Orissa will likely see showers and thunderstorms in its wake for the next day or so as the cleanup begins.

       "19    A bachelor’s degree in psychology from George Mason University fetched a median starting salary of $30,256 for recent graduates who landed a job in the state. A degree in computer and information sciences from GMU drew $55,213.In both fields, those salaries beat the state average and exceeded what graduates from many other Virginia colleges were earning within 18 months of receiving identical degrees.Those are among the findings from a groundbreaking database Virginia published Thursday that pinpoints for the first time how much graduates from specific college programs, public and private, earn when they enter the job market. That’s a matter of intense interest to many parents and lawmakers in an era of rising student debt and college bills that can total tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars.“Students and their families should have this information at their fingertips so they can make better-informed decisions about where to enroll, what to major in and how much debt they might comfortably take on relative to their likely earnings,” Mark Schneider, vice president of the nonprofit American Institutes for Research, told Congress last month.Virginia’s data initiative has been quietly in the works for a few years. This year, Sens. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) and Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) teamed up on a bill that would help other states link detailed higher education and labor market data and report it to the public. They call it the “Student Right to Know Before You Go Act.” Experts say similar disclosure efforts are underway in Tennessee, Arkansas, Colorado, Nevada and Texas.The data released Thursday by the State Council of Higher Education for Virginia came with plenty of caveats. It did not include salary information for graduates who left the state or got a job in the military or federal government. There were no adjustments for regional differences in the cost of living. Many four-year graduates went on to graduate school instead of seeking a job.Experts cautioned that it can take several years to reveal the earning power of a degree, and that higher education is about far more than a financial return on investment. Still, the data cast a spotlight on a core question: What is a degree worth?For people who earned a bachelor’s degree in business administration at a Virginia college and then obtained a job within the state, part of the answer could lie in their median starting salary. That, according to the state data, which aggregated information for graduates from 2005 to 2010, was $35,565.At Marymount University in Arlington, the median for such graduates was a bit higher: $37,582. Annual tuition at the private school is $24,900.“We’re trying to educate the whole person at Marymount,” said the school’s president, Matt Shank, “so when you look at salary it’s just one sliver of the bigger picture.”Shank, like other college leaders, said students should also factor financial aid into their thinking about value.Peter Stearns, provost of George Mason, said: “My biggest fear is that people would rush to premature conclusions about the value of a particular degree. You sort of want a view that would have whole careers in mind. There’s more to a job than income.”At GMU, a public university, in-state tuition is $9,420.Several educators said they worried that the publication of salary data would give potential applicants a misleading picture of schools. “It’s hard not to make judgments when you look at raw data like that,” said Tracy Fitzsimmons, president of Shenandoah University in Winchester. “I wouldn’t want students and their parents to choose an educational institution, or even a career, based solely on projected earnings.”The data show that median starting salaries for recent graduates with Shenandoah bachelor’s degrees ranged from $21,143 (environmental studies) to $47,148 (respiratory care therapy). Annual tuition at the private school is $27,550.At the University of Mary Washington in Fredericksburg, the chief of staff to President Richard V. Hurley said he didn’t know what to make of the data.“I was a history major,” said Martin Wilder. “How about you?” For those with a bachelor’s degree in history from the school, the median starting salary was $28,403. The public university’s in-state tuition is $4,686.The Virginia database grew out of a movement to trace the path of individual students from elementary school through college, what is known as a “longitudinal data system.” In recent years, state officials also have conferred about how to link education data with employment and wage records gathered for the state unemployment insurance program. They came up with a solution that stripped the merged records of identifying individual information to protect the privacy of students, graduates and employees.This year, the state legislature passed a law requiring annual publication of the wage and degree data.The state higher education council consulted extensively with college leaders to assuage their concerns. Caveats and provisos about the wage and salary information are displayed prominently on the Web site.“The more we talk to them, the more at ease they seem to be with it,” said Kirsten Nelson, a spokeswoman for the council.Grover “Russ” Whitehurst, a Brookings Institution analyst who was a senior education official in George W. Bush’s administration, said the publication of labor market data linked to colleges is overdue and is more important to applicants than indicators such as graduation rates or admissions selectivity.“The most important thing government can do to increase productivity and innovation in higher education is to let people actually shop,” Whitehurst said. “It is revolutionary.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
       "20    Already, 23 states allow marijuana to be prescribed for medicinal use, making it easy for proponents for broader legalization, such as the Marijuana Policy Project, to brand the drug as “harmless.” Some go further, calling it “safe” and even “healthy.” The result is that voters in Oregon and Alaska — in addition to D.C. — may soon join Colorado and Washington as the first states to fully legalize recreational pot for adults.The problem is that marijuana is not, in fact, “harmless.” (Update: After publication, the Marijuana Policy Project altered the language on its site to call pot “a much less harmful substance” than alcohol. Here is a screenshot of the original.) Proponents are spinning the science — casting pot as a threat only if used improperly, much like a car — for the sake of advancing their political agenda. It’s fine for people to believe the government has no business conducting a “war on drugs,” but it’s something else entirely to trivialize or simply deny marijuana’s harmful effects. These dangers are real, according to a recently released comprehensive review of 20 years of scientific literature from Wayne Hall, who advises the World Health Organization on addiction and runs the University of Queensland’s Center for Youth Substance Abuse Research. And the dangers need to be dealt with.The role of government in regulating drugs can’t be separated from what those drugs do to people. On that question, pot-libertarians have taken too many liberties — about both its medical and its recreational effects.Proponents claim marijuana can slow or stop damage caused by glaucoma (by lowering eye pressure), but as Henry D. Jampel, professor of ophthalmology at Johns Hopkins, points out, marijuana could actually worsen the vision loss caused by glaucoma. “Although marijuana does lower the eye pressure, it also lowers blood pressure,” he notes. “Lower blood pressure could result in reduced blood supply to the optic nerve, which in turn might harm the optic nerve.”Beyond the medical applications, legalization proponents argue that marijuana should be available for recreational use because it’s “harmless” and not addictive. But the active ingredient in marijuana, THC, is a powerful psychoactive ingredient that can cause hallucinations or delusions and interfere with the way the brain makes and stores memories. Hall’s study found that marijuana use doubles the risk of developing psychotic disorders, including schizophrenia. He also found that one in 10 adults who regularly smoke the drug become dependent on it, and those who use it are more likely to go on to use harder drugs.His study also emphasizes the danger that marijuana use poses to teens — one in six teenagers who regularly smoke pot will become dependent. Other research backs up these warnings: A recent review of more than 120 studies found that teen marijuana use is associated with subsequent addiction to other drugs and psychosis, such as schizophrenia. And a recent study from researchers at the University of Wisconsin at Milwaukee linked regular marijuana use by teens to drops in IQ points and to memory problems.While the states that have legalized marijuana completely have done so only for residents 21 and older, peer-reviewed research has linked heavy marijuana use with long-term memory problems and other health effects in adults. Marijuana also poses dangers to pregnant women, with studies linking the drug to lower birth weight, impaired brain development and behavior problems in adolescents.And while proponents of legalization point out that it’s impossible to overdose on cannabis, that doesn’t mean there aren’t any instances of marijuana-related deaths. A handful of deaths in Denver were tied to edible marijuana use this year, not to mention the increased risk of fatal car accidents due to drivers impaired by marijuana. Hall’s study analyzed epidemiological studies and laboratory evidence from a number of researchers and concluded that driving after smoking pot approximately doubles the risk of a car crash.Because marijuana has been illegal for decades, intensive studies are lacking and there are still many questions surrounding the safety of marijuana. Hall’s report is a meta-analysis of available research on marijuana, but much of the work on marijuana’s effects has focused on heavy, long-term users or vulnerable populations, including teenagers and pregnant women. We need more research on the effect of marijuana on casual users.As more states move to legalize marijuana, polls indicate that Americans are growing much more accepting of marijuana use. But the growing acceptance and availability of pot, along with the misleading advertisements spread by legalization proponents, are spreading the dangerous myth that marijuana is risk-free. There are compelling reasons to change our policy toward marijuana — notably, cutting down on incarceration rates for possession. But simply ignoring the science on the negative effects of chronic (no pun intended) marijuana use does a disservice to the dialogue around marijuana.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",
       "21    America is getting less white a lot faster than the Republican Party. That trend threatens to be a problem over the long term for the GOP.When Donald Trump told an interviewer last week that Republicans would never win another election if Hillary Clinton triumphed in November, we took a look at the heart of his claim. Clinton would give blanket citizenship to millions of immigrants, Trump asserted, throwing elections to her party thanks to all those new Hispanic voters. But we pointed out that the demographics of the country are already headed that way.New data from Pew Research makes this point more clearly by looking at past trends.Since 1992, Pew estimates that the density of nonwhite voters in the Republican Party has doubled from 7 to 14 percent. In the Democratic Party, the increase has been a bit less than double — but it's substantially larger as a percentage of the party. The density of nonwhite voters in the Republican Party in 2016 is still only a little more than half what it was for the Democrats 24 years ago.But the density of nonwhite voters in the electorate has just about doubled, too. The Democratic Party is getting less white faster than the voting population; the GOP is getting less white a lot more slowly.The GOP is now about as diverse as the electorate was when Bill Clinton first won the presidency.What's happened to the GOP, as my colleague Aaron Blake wrote on Tuesday, is that it has increasingly become the domain of older white men without college degrees. (In 1992, 38 percent of Republicans were 50 or older; in 2016, the figure is 58 percent.) The graph at the top of this post suggests that this might be less of a problem for the party, given that the number of older whites in the population will also increase.The challenge is that younger white voters — the people who will be 65 by 2060 — are more likely to identify as Democrats than older whites.White millennials (defined by Pew as being born in 1981 or later) identify with or lean toward both parties equally. Among Gen Xers (born 1965 to 1980), the GOP has a 15-point advantage. Among boomers, it's 20 points. Millennials who aren't white are also more likely to be Democratic by a wide margin but with less of a difference from older nonwhite voters.There's some variation in party identities over time, but the Democrats are starting from a position of advantage. Research suggests that political beliefs usually form early, with events by the age of 18 being more influential than events later in life. All of which suggests that the tie ballgame with white voters coupled with the wide Democratic advantage among nonwhites as the electorate grows less white is a significant long-term problem for the Republican Party.Political parties can change (which helps drive some of that movement in the charts above). We remember that the GOP outlined a plan to reach out to Hispanic voters after Mitt Romney's loss in 2012. The only problem was that the existing base wasn't enthusiastic about it, so much so that the current Republican nominee is much more fervently opposed to immigration reform than Romney was.An optimistic way to look at that: Things can change fast. This should offer the GOP some reassurance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",
       "22    On Thursday, millions of Americans became eligible to take advantage of the government’s most generous student loan repayment plan.The repayment program, known as Revised Pay as You Earn or REPAYE, caps borrowers’ monthly bills to 10 percent of their income and forgives the debt after 20 years of payment. Up until now, those terms were only available for people with especially low income relative to their debt and who took out their loans after 2007. But the Obama administration opened the program to anyone with what’s known as a Direct federal loan, regardless of their income or when they borrowed.[The Obama administration’s plan to lower the student debt payments of millions more Americans]All income-driven plans are designed to prevent people from defaulting on their student loans, which can severely damage a person’s credit rating and make it much harder to buy a car or a house. Still, these plans are not for everyone. And before enrolling in the latest one, there are a few things to consider. Let’s start with the basics:Eligible loans: All Direct federal loans, as long as they are not in default, are eligible for the new plan. As you might recall, the government decided in 2010 to only lend directly to borrowers, rather than backing loans originated by banks and other financial firms. At the time, the government had a small direct lending portfolio that has since tripled in size. If you have one of those old bank-based loans from the Federal Family Education Loan Program (FFEL) or a Perkins loans, you can consolidate that debt into a Direct loan to take advantage of REPAYE. Parent PLUS loans are not eligible for this program.Monthly payments: The calculation is based on your discretionary income, or whatever you earn above 150 percent of the federal poverty line ($17,655 for a single person). If you make $30,000, for instance, your discretionary income would be $12,345. That means your monthly loan payments would initially be capped at $102.88. If your income is very low, you may not have to pay anything until your paycheck increases.You have to update your financial information every year, so the more you make the more you will pay. Keep in mind that depending on how your paycheck changes over time, you may wind up paying more than you would under the 10-year standard repayment plan. Check out the Department of Education’s repayment estimator to get a sense of what you will be doling out.[There’s a way to dramatically lower student debt payments, but hardly anyone uses it]Debt forgiveness: If after 20 years of making payments on your undergraduate loans, you’re still carrying a balance, the remaining money will be wiped away. Here’s the thing, the Internal Revenue Service will treat that sum as taxable income, unless Congress changes the current rules, according to the National Foundation for Credit Counseling. Let’s say you have a $10,000 balance forgiven. That money will be tacked onto your income, which could put you in a higher tax bracket and leave you susceptible to paying Uncle Sam more money.Credit: The Institute for College Access & SuccessAlready in an income-driven plan: You can switch into REPAYE, even if you’re enrolled in one of the older income-driven plans (there are four others). Keep in mind, however, any unpaid interest will be added to your loan principal, causing interest to accrue on a higher loan balance, according to the Institute for College Access and Success. And if you consolidate you old bank-based loans to get into REPAYE, any previous payments you made while enrolled in income-based repayment will not count toward the period of time needed to qualify for forgiveness.Graduate debt terms: Anyone who borrowed for graduate school will have to make payments for 25 years, five years longer than everyone else, to have their remaining balance forgiven. The stipulation is meant to lower the ultimate cost of forgiving the debt of grad students, who tend to borrow more.Matrimony penalty: Married borrowers can no longer lower their payments by excluding their spouse’s income, unless they are separated or victims of domestic abuse.Signing up: You’ve got two options here. You can apply online at www.studentloans.gov, where you may be able to electronically upload your tax return information.

       "23    Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx stepped up his pressure on Metro to improve its safety performance Thursday by replacing three members of the transit agency’s board with experienced transportation-safety professionals.Foxx, who has been frustrated by the delay in creating a new Metro safety oversight office, made clear in a written announcement that his impatience was growing with the agency and the three local jurisdictions that help govern it.“Given the continued urgency, we will be forced to use every available lever at our discretion to force action as soon as possible to improve safety for the traveling public,” Foxx said. “No more excuses.”In a timely reminder of the problems that Foxx wants addressed, Metro announced a four-day service slowdown along part of the Red Line so work crews can carry out what the agency called a “maintenance surge.”The repair effort follows several days of Red Line disruptions between the Van Ness-UDC and Medical Center stations — including an emergency evacuation of train passengers Saturday night because of an electrical problem that caused smoke in a tunnel.[Metro sank into crisis despite decades of warnings.]The three new federal board members, who will take office June 1, are Carol Carmody, former vice chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board; David Strickland, former administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration; and Robert Lauby, chief safety officer of the Federal Railroad Administration.They will replace Mortimer Downey, who recently completed a term as board chairman; Harriet Tregoning, a senior official at the Department of Housing and Urban Development: and Anthony R. Giancola, former executive director of the National Association of County Engineers.Foxx praised the outgoing directors for their “excellent service,” but there was no mistaking his desire to force change on the board so Metro would deal more aggressively with safety.Despite decades of warnings from the federal government and others, Metro has failed to instill a safety-first mind-set in its workforce and allowed its equipment to deteriorate so much that it sometimes endangers riders.“Building a safety culture is not easy and requires relentless focus at every level,” Foxx wrote. “These three new Federal members will build on our promise to bring a laser-like focus on making the transit system of our nation’s capital as safe as possible.”Foxx’s action comes at a time of increased scrutiny of Metro’s governing structure, which has long been blamed as a contributor to the agency’s difficulties.A few hours after the announcement, Rep. John Delaney (D-Md.) filed a bill in the House that would require three of the federal government’s four board appointees to be certified as experts in transportation, management, finance or safety.Delaney said it appeared that the three new members meet his bill’s standards, but he still wanted the requirements codified into law.The bill also provides that if the Metro Compact — the agency’s governing document — is amended, then the same standards would apply to members appointed by the three local jurisdictions that also govern Metro. The District, Virginia and Maryland each appoint four board members.The Metro board chairman, Jack Evans, was cool to the bill, suggesting that Congress would do better to give Metro more money.“It’s an interesting bill [but] I don’t know that having any kind of background in transit or other things is necessary to be a board member,” Evans said, noting that he would be precluded from serving on the board. A lawyer by training, Evans has been a D.C. Council member for 25 years, representing Ward 2.Evans has been pressing Congress to give Metro $300 million a year — approximately what each of the three local jurisdictions contributes — to help the agency cover its annual operational deficit.“Here’s what I would say. .?.?. I would ask every member of Congress who wants to help to get me my $300 million. .?.?. Don’t introduce [a] bill to change the chairs on the deck of the Titanic,” Evans said. “Congressman Delaney, congressman whoever — here, there and everywhere — help me get my $300 million. I can’t tell you anything that’s more critical to the agency.”Foxx has taken an unusually hands-on approach to safety at Metro.In October, following a series of high-profile safety lapses, Foxx announced that the Federal Transit Administration would take responsibility for safety oversight of Metro’s rail system. The move was recognition that the current regional safety agency, the Tri-State Oversight Committee had largely failed in its job.Foxx also has kept the pressure on leaders in the District, Maryland and Virginia to set up a replacement body. He has threatened to withhold federal funds if they fail to act by the end of this year.Thursday’s appointments also might be seen as an effort to blunt criticism from the NTSB, which is expected to release its report on the fatal 2015 Yellow Line smoke incident early next month.Of the new board members, Carmody and Strickland will be voting members. Lauby will be an alternate, who votes only when one of the two federal voting members is absent.The fourth current federal representative, Anthony E. Costa, an alternate member, remains on the board.The most prominent member to exit the board is Downey, a former U.S. deputy secretary of transportation. He said he did not view his replacement as a rebuke of his performance in six years on the Metro board.He said he talked with Foxx about it and the secretary “says it is not in his view that this is taking any objection to anything I’ve done.”Instead, Downey said, “they’re doing what they think is necessary, and they’re looking for results.”During the maintenance work on the Red Line, trains share one track between Van Ness and Medical Center on Thursday and Friday from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m., and from 8 p.m. to midnight; and all day and night over the weekend.Because of the single-tracking, wait times between trains will be extended by at least 20 minutes.Metro General Manager Paul J. Wiedefeld said the repairs were necessary in part because that section of the subway is especially deep and has long been plagued by moisture seeping in from the ground.Lori Aratani contributed to this report.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",
       "24    By the time 18-year-old Aaron Young wound up at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center in Los Angeles last October, he’d been wrestling for months with excruciating stomach pain and vomiting that repeatedly sent him to the emergency room.Diagnosed with acute pancreatitis, he underwent what is typically a low-risk procedure in which doctors inserted a special device down his throat to treat his digestive system.But instead of recovering, Young developed a raging bacterial infection and a relentless 104-degree fever. He recovered after nearly three months in the hospital but had to return for another procedure in late January. The infection flared anew, and he is now likely to be in the hospital for at least another month, his family says.Young is among seven patients at UCLA who were infected with a hard-to-treat “superbug” that hospital officials traced to two specialized scopes that they said were contaminated despite being thoroughly cleaned. Two of the patients later died, and scores more were potentially exposed.After the incident became public, the Food and Drug Administration warned that the devices, called duodenoscopes, can be difficult to sanitize and “may facilitate the spread of deadly bacteria.”Now medical experts and lawmakers want to know why the FDA and the manufacturers of the devices — all of which have been aware of the potential problem for years — didn’t move more quickly and aggressively to ensure patient safety.The urgency around the issue intensified Wednesday after Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles disclosed that four patients who underwent endoscopic procedures had been infected by the same germ as at UCLA: a drug-resistant form of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, or CRE. [FDA warns about medical scopes after ‘superbug’ hits California hospital] Hartford Hospital in Connecticut said Wednesday that 281 patients were possibly exposed during the same type of procedure to a strain of E. coli. Young’s family, meanwhile, has sued Olympus Corp., the manufacturer of the device involved in the UCLA case, on his behalf, alleging fraud and negligence. The suit claims the company didn’t provide updated cleaning protocols to hospitals when it introduced a newer version of the device in 2010.“The lawsuit is almost beside the point,” said Lori Smith, Aaron’s adoptive mother and herself a registered nurse, in her first interview on the matter. “We’d just like them to do something so that people are better informed. Nobody said Aaron could get something from these scopes that could kill him. .?.?. We just had no idea.”The family of Antonia Torres Cerda, a 48-year-old woman who died in November after apparently being exposed to a contaminated duodenoscope at the hospital, has sued the company for wrongful death. Cerda underwent the endoscopy procedure before receiving a liver transplant.An Olympus spokesman said the company “does not comment on active legal matters or speculation” but added that it “continuously strives to improve our products for safe and effective use.”‘Why did it take so long?’For years, the FDA has received warnings — from hospitals, from clinicians, and from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — about possible links between the duodenoscopes and the spread of deadly infections. The devices are used in a procedure known as ERCP, or endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, on roughly 500,000 patients annually in the United States. They are considered a critical tool in diagnosing and treating cancers, gallstones and other ailments of the digestive system in a minimally invasive way. [California public health officials are tracking down 179 patients after superbug deaths] The general public may not have known about the small but serious risks associated with bacteria harbored in duodenoscopes, but some medical experts have been flagging the problem for decades.“We have known about this even as early as 1983 or 1984,” said John Allen, a professor at the Yale School of Medicine who is president of the American Gastroenterological Association. In 1987, Allen wrote in an academic journal about 10 of his patients in Minnesota mysteriously becoming infected with a bacteria known as Pseudomonas. He and his colleagues traced the infections to a single duodenoscope, whose small crevices harbored bacteria despite repeated cleanings.In 2009, after a dozen patients in France were infected with drug-resistant bacteria linked to a contaminated duodenoscope, the FDA, the CDC and the Department of Veterans Affairs warned hospitals and other medical facilities about the risk of cross-contamination if scopes weren’t properly cleaned and sterilized. That warning applied to all medical scopes, not just duodenoscopes.But since 2012, infections linked to duodenoscopes have occurred at Advocate Lutheran General Hospital near Chicago, where 44 people were infected, and at the Virginia Mason Medical Center in Seattle, where at least 32 patients became ill and 11 died. It’s unclear how significant a role the CRE bacteria played in those deaths.Over the years, Allen said, experts responded to outbreaks by adding another cleaning step, such as flushing the devices with alcohol. The latest outbreak “reemphasizes the fact that we haven’t solved the fundamental problem,” which he said ultimately could boil down to a design flaw.During the past two years, the FDA has received at least 75 reports about the devices, involving at least 135 patients, and those numbers may be low given that many such events don’t get reported. In 2013, the agency said, it received notice from the CDC about a possible association between the complex devices and multi-drug-resistant bacteria. Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) last month wrote to FDA Commissioner Margaret Hamburg, urging the agency to publicly address the issue.“The big question is, why did it take so long?” said John Greene, an infectious-disease doctor at Moffitt Cancer Center in Florida, who in 2013 co-authored an article about an outbreak involving duodenoscopes in Tampa. “It’s a very fair question. .?.?. Unfortunately, things don’t happen until bad outcomes occur.”Ten House members are asking similar questions. In a letter Wednesday to the FDA, they wrote, “The alarming spread of superbug outbreaks across the country demands a forceful, substantive response from the federal government.” One of the letter’s authors, Rep. Ted Lieu (D-Calif.), represents the district where Ronald Reagan Medical Center is located and has called for a congressional hearing.Stephen Ostroff, the FDA’s chief scientist and soon to be its acting commissioner, said in an interview that the agency had indeed been closely studying the problem before the most recent outbreak. He said agency officials had become especially concerned about the 2013 Illinois infections because there were no obvious sterilization lapses and because the devastating CRE bacteria was becoming more common across the country.The agency redoubled its efforts, scouring medical research and adverse events reports to try to answer several critical questions: Are existing disinfection procedures sufficient? If not, what are the alternatives? Is the problem unique to one model or manufacturer? Does the intricate design of duodenoscopes make them especially hard to sterilize?Last year, Ostroff said, the FDA requested more data from the three manufacturers marketing duodenoscopes in the United States — Fujifilm, Pentax and Olympus — to prove that their cleaning instructions actually work.

       "25    By the time 18-year-old Aaron Young wound up at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center in Los Angeles last October, he’d been wrestling for months with excruciating stomach pain and vomiting that repeatedly sent him to the emergency room.Diagnosed with acute pancreatitis, he underwent what is typically a low-risk procedure in which doctors inserted a special device down his throat to treat his digestive system.But instead of recovering, Young developed a raging bacterial infection and a relentless 104-degree fever. He recovered after nearly three months in the hospital but had to return for another procedure in late January. The infection flared anew, and he is now likely to be in the hospital for at least another month, his family says.Young is among seven patients at UCLA who were infected with a hard-to-treat “superbug” that hospital officials traced to two specialized scopes that they said were contaminated despite being thoroughly cleaned. Two of the patients later died, and scores more were potentially exposed.After the incident became public, the Food and Drug Administration warned that the devices, called duodenoscopes, can be difficult to sanitize and “may facilitate the spread of deadly bacteria.”Now medical experts and lawmakers want to know why the FDA and the manufacturers of the devices — all of which have been aware of the potential problem for years — didn’t move more quickly and aggressively to ensure patient safety.The urgency around the issue intensified Wednesday after Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles disclosed that four patients who underwent endoscopic procedures had been infected by the same germ as at UCLA: a drug-resistant form of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, or CRE. [FDA warns about medical scopes after ‘superbug’ hits California hospital] Hartford Hospital in Connecticut said Wednesday that 281 patients were possibly exposed during the same type of procedure to a strain of E. coli. Young’s family, meanwhile, has sued Olympus Corp., the manufacturer of the device involved in the UCLA case, on his behalf, alleging fraud and negligence. The suit claims the company didn’t provide updated cleaning protocols to hospitals when it introduced a newer version of the device in 2010.“The lawsuit is almost beside the point,” said Lori Smith, Aaron’s adoptive mother and herself a registered nurse, in her first interview on the matter. “We’d just like them to do something so that people are better informed. Nobody said Aaron could get something from these scopes that could kill him. .?.?. We just had no idea.”The family of Antonia Torres Cerda, a 48-year-old woman who died in November after apparently being exposed to a contaminated duodenoscope at the hospital, has sued the company for wrongful death. Cerda underwent the endoscopy procedure before receiving a liver transplant.An Olympus spokesman said the company “does not comment on active legal matters or speculation” but added that it “continuously strives to improve our products for safe and effective use.”‘Why did it take so long?’For years, the FDA has received warnings — from hospitals, from clinicians, and from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — about possible links between the duodenoscopes and the spread of deadly infections. The devices are used in a procedure known as ERCP, or endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, on roughly 500,000 patients annually in the United States. They are considered a critical tool in diagnosing and treating cancers, gallstones and other ailments of the digestive system in a minimally invasive way. [California public health officials are tracking down 179 patients after superbug deaths] The general public may not have known about the small but serious risks associated with bacteria harbored in duodenoscopes, but some medical experts have been flagging the problem for decades.“We have known about this even as early as 1983 or 1984,” said John Allen, a professor at the Yale School of Medicine who is president of the American Gastroenterological Association. In 1987, Allen wrote in an academic journal about 10 of his patients in Minnesota mysteriously becoming infected with a bacteria known as Pseudomonas. He and his colleagues traced the infections to a single duodenoscope, whose small crevices harbored bacteria despite repeated cleanings.In 2009, after a dozen patients in France were infected with drug-resistant bacteria linked to a contaminated duodenoscope, the FDA, the CDC and the Department of Veterans Affairs warned hospitals and other medical facilities about the risk of cross-contamination if scopes weren’t properly cleaned and sterilized. That warning applied to all medical scopes, not just duodenoscopes.But since 2012, infections linked to duodenoscopes have occurred at Advocate Lutheran General Hospital near Chicago, where 44 people were infected, and at the Virginia Mason Medical Center in Seattle, where at least 32 patients became ill and 11 died. It’s unclear how significant a role the CRE bacteria played in those deaths.Over the years, Allen said, experts responded to outbreaks by adding another cleaning step, such as flushing the devices with alcohol. The latest outbreak “reemphasizes the fact that we haven’t solved the fundamental problem,” which he said ultimately could boil down to a design flaw.During the past two years, the FDA has received at least 75 reports about the devices, involving at least 135 patients, and those numbers may be low given that many such events don’t get reported. In 2013, the agency said, it received notice from the CDC about a possible association between the complex devices and multi-drug-resistant bacteria. Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) last month wrote to FDA Commissioner Margaret Hamburg, urging the agency to publicly address the issue.“The big question is, why did it take so long?” said John Greene, an infectious-disease doctor at Moffitt Cancer Center in Florida, who in 2013 co-authored an article about an outbreak involving duodenoscopes in Tampa. “It’s a very fair question. .?.?. Unfortunately, things don’t happen until bad outcomes occur.”Ten House members are asking similar questions. In a letter Wednesday to the FDA, they wrote, “The alarming spread of superbug outbreaks across the country demands a forceful, substantive response from the federal government.” One of the letter’s authors, Rep. Ted Lieu (D-Calif.), represents the district where Ronald Reagan Medical Center is located and has called for a congressional hearing.Stephen Ostroff, the FDA’s chief scientist and soon to be its acting commissioner, said in an interview that the agency had indeed been closely studying the problem before the most recent outbreak. He said agency officials had become especially concerned about the 2013 Illinois infections because there were no obvious sterilization lapses and because the devastating CRE bacteria was becoming more common across the country.The agency redoubled its efforts, scouring medical research and adverse events reports to try to answer several critical questions: Are existing disinfection procedures sufficient? If not, what are the alternatives? Is the problem unique to one model or manufacturer? Does the intricate design of duodenoscopes make them especially hard to sterilize?Last year, Ostroff said, the FDA requested more data from the three manufacturers marketing duodenoscopes in the United States — Fujifilm, Pentax and Olympus — to prove that their cleaning instructions actually work. It asked for more data after deciding the first batch was insufficient and began conducting its own tests to see if specific features make the devices hard to sanitize.“These are not things you do overnight,” Ostroff said.Olympus began selling its TJF-Q180V duodenoscope in 2010.

       "26    People who carry a gene for sickle cell disease might not have an elevated mortality risk, according to a study released today in the New England Journal of Medicine.Sickle cell disease occurs in 1 out of every 365 black people born in America, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. They carry two copies of a gene for sickle cell disease. Those who carry only one copy of the gene are said to have sickle cell trait. About 1 in 13 black Americans have sickle cell trait. An earlier study found that sickle cell trait may lead to an increased risk of sudden death, but the new study comes to a different conclusion.Sickle cell disease causes red blood cells to be misshapen and can lead to lifelong pain and a reduced lifespan. It wasn't clear whether sickle cell trait is dangerous.Researchers at Stanford University Medical Center found that there seemed to be no significant difference in death risk for people with sickle cell trait compared to those without it. However, carriers of the sickle cell trait were more likely to develop exertional rhabdomyolysis, a breakdown of skeletal muscle tissue caused by strenuous exercise.Stanford researchers reviewed the health records of 47,944 black soldiers with known sickle cell status who served between 2011 and 2014. The records were from the Stanford Military Data Repository data set, a digital archive of health encounters at military and civilian medical institutions. The records also include basic health information and certified records of physical performance and mortality of all active duty U.S. Army soldiers.Gender, age and lifestyle factors also affected who experienced exertional rhabdomyolysis. Women had a significantly lower rate compared to men, and soldiers over 36 saw a 57 percent heightened risk for exertional distress. Risk for exercise-related muscle breakdown was also significantly higher in soldiers who had obesity, smoked or took anti-psychotic drugs.Lianne Kurina, one of the lead researchers of the study, said the findings could indicate that perhaps the focus shouldn’t be on sickle cell trait, but other factors that lead to rhabdomyolysis. “There are a lot of factors that should be considered,” she said. “Sickle cell trait is a non-modifiable risk factor. Some of these factors are modifiable.”Rakhi Naik, a certified hematologist at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, said that the study’s findings are exciting.“One thing that’s the most important is that there have been these mandated screenings” for sickle cell trait, she said. The Army, Navy and NCAA now test for sickle cell trait. People who test positive for the gene are warned against dehydration and overheating. “The major point of this study is that it seems that the risk of death can be completely eliminated by hydration.”Kurina also said that increased awareness about hydration and overheating might have contributed to the reason why there isn't an increase in mortality among soldiers with sickle cell trait.She hopes the research will also promote further discussion about screening for sickle cell trait.A 1987 study reported a 2,800 percent increase in the risk of exertion-induced sudden deaths among black recruits thought to have sickle cell trait. That study helped lead to more screening. The new study pointed out that the sickle cell status of every person in the past study wasn’t known.Kurina said knowing the sickle cell status of everyone involved in her research was crucial to her team’s findings. “This is really the first time where people have this population where high numbers of people have been tested,” she said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",
       "27    The creation of a radioactive tracer can take two to three years of intensive laboratory work.The first step is to find a molecular target — a biomarker associated with a specific cancer. Past chemical studies are then searched for compounds that might bind uniquely to the biomarker. These potential tracers are then modified to be compatible with the technology that would monitor the chemical in the body.They also must be modified so they will not degrade, once injected in a patient, before a scan is taken. The tracer is then tested on animals (usually mice) to see whether it remains active long enough for imaging to occur and whether it is excreted before it can harm the body. The better the design of the tracer, the more successful it will be in highlighting the features of the tumor.Patients considering molecular imaging treatment are sometimes offered entry into clinical trials. It is important to know that, whereas most experimental chemotherapy drugs have significant side effects, “the immediate risk from molecular imaging is virtually zero,” according to Peter Herscovitch, president of the Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging. That is because the number of molecules of radioactive material is tiny, he says.Related: A better way to diagnose and treat cancer

       "28    When Treasury Secretary Jack Lew announced last June that a woman would be featured on a redesigned $10 bill, women across the country rejoiced.Unfortunately, it now seems clear that Treasury’s plan falls far short of what women expected. Instead of our own bill, we may get a woman on only some $10 bills or a woman on the back of the bill, with Alexander Hamilton remaining on the front. The benefit of giving millions of American women representation on our currency apparently is not worth the cost of potentially diminishing the prominence of a single American man. That is not the message Treasury should want to send.I like Hamilton and would be happy for him to appear on a different bill. But if women are denied this opportunity for the $10 bill, it could be years before the next bill is redesigned. American women have waited long enough.

       "29    Does Europe need another week full of panic? Not really. But that seems to be on order anyway. Spain's borrowing costs are already rocketing to unsustainable levels as investors worry that the world's eleventh-largest economy is mired in endless recession with no chance to ease its debt burden. And, if that wasn't enough, there's now renewed chatter that Greece might get kicked out of the euro zone.Greece's problems look severe. To date, the country has received pledges of €240 billion ($291 billion) in rescue aid from the European Community, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund. In return for that assistance, however, Greece was supposed to whittle its debts down to 120 percent of GDP by 2020.It's never been clear what the rationale behind this target was. At the time it was proposed, many economists called it arbitrary and unrealistic. Greece is already trapped in one of the worst depressions in modern history. The government is under intense public pressure to ease up on the €12 billion in planned tax hikes and spending cuts in 2012. What were the odds that Greece would ever meet this goal?Yet IMF and European officials declared the 120 percent target sacrosanct. And it could prove fatal for Greece. Over the weekend, Der Spiegel quoted a few anonymous E.U. officials who agreed that there was no way Greece would hit its debt targets. In that case, the Greek government will likely need another €10 billion or €50 billion of aid just to stay afloat. But according to Der Spiegel, neither Germany nor the IMF appear willing to open the spigots again. Here's one quote:The Süddeutsche Zeitung cited an unnamed German government source as saying it was \"inconceivable that Chancellor Angela Merkel would again ask German parliament for approval for a third Greece bailout package.\"And here's a quote from Germany's economic minister (who also happens to be vice-chancellor under Angela Merkel):Meanwhile, German Economy Minister Philipp Rösler said on Sunday he was \"more than skeptical\" that Greece's reform efforts will succeed. \"If Greece no longer meets its requirements there can be no further payments,\" he said in an interview with German public broadcaster ARD. \"For me, a Greek exit has long since lost its horrors.\"The IMF and euro zone will make a decision on further aid in August, but does this sound like a country that wants to make things work? Some German newspapers are rejoicing at the latest hard line. Here's the Bild: \"At last! This signal was overdue. Greece is neither able nor willing to solve its problems.\"The center-left paper Süddeutsche Zeitung, meanwhile, looked at the practical results. If the IMF and Europe refuse to extend further aid, then Greece will have to declare itself insolvent by September. At that point, the European Central Bank will have to decide whether to shut off financing for Greece. If it does, Greek Prime Minister Antonio Samaras will be forced to find a new currency. \"Such a step,\" the newspaper concluded, \"would entail incalculable risks for the Greek government. ... But it will probably have to embark on this adventure.\" (Those \"incalculable risks,\" by the way, include a potential 50 percent drop in Greece's GDP in the first year alone.)Of course, if Greece exits the euro, everyone will start worrying that Spain or Italy could be next. Investors could start betting on a Spanish exit, which would risk becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy. Which means the euro zone will likely need a bigger bailout fund to quell any panic. But Europe's new €500 billion ($605 billion) European Stability Mechanism won't be ready until at least mid-September, when Germany's constitutional court decides whether or not to block the fund's creation. Without that fund, a Greek exit might not be so horror-free after all.Related: FAQ: Why is Greece in such trouble?

       "8478  An Ohio zoo that has the last Sumatran rhino in the United States on Tuesday announced plans to send the endangered animal to Southeast Asia on a mission to mate.Conservation experts at the Cincinnati Zoo say 8-year-old Harapan will soon travel to Indonesia, where nearly all of the estimated 100 remaining Sumatran rhinos live. Numbers of the two-horned descendants of Ice Age woolly rhinos have fallen by some 90 percent since the mid-1980s, when humans began to clear their Southeast Asia forest habitat and poachers started seeking their prized horns.Cincinnati’s zoo has been a pioneer in breeding the species, producing the first three born in captivity in modern times. Harapan will join the eldest, Andalas, who has been in Indonesia since 2007 and has produced one male offspring. Andalas will turn 14 next month.“We are very sad about the [Sumatran rhino] program coming to an end here in Cincinnati,” said Terri Roth, the longtime head of the zoo’s Center for Conservation and Research of Endangered Wildlife. “It’s a huge loss for us. But it’s the right thing to at least have Harapan able to contribute to survival of the species.” — Associated Press

       "8479  DETROIT— With General Motors under intense scrutiny for failing to repair a defect the automaker has linked to 12 deaths, chief executive Mary T. Barra appointed a top executive Tuesday to oversee global vehicle safety.Barra said the new executive vice president, 40-year GM employee Jeffrey Boyer, will be in charge of new-car safety as well as all safety recalls. She said the new post “elevates and integrates our safety process under a single leader so we can set a new standard for customer safety with more rigorous accountability.”Barra, speaking Tuesday to reporters at the company’s headquarters overlooking the Detroit River, said the appointment is one of several steps that GM is taking to tighten its oversight of vehicle safety.“We want to make sure this problem never happens again,” Barra said.The appointment comes during an unfolding scandal over GM’s failure to fix ignition switches that if jostled or weighted with too many keys could cause cars to stall, disabling their air bags. So far, the problem has been officially linked by the company to 31 accidents and 12 deaths. Last month, the automaker recalled 1.6 million Chevrolet Cobalts and five other vehicle models.GM has told safety regulators that it fielded complaints about the problem as early as 2001. But the company said it could not pinpoint the problem and did not issue a recall until last month.The Boyer appointment comes a day after the automaker announced three more recalls, unrelated to the faulty ignition switch.The long inaction on the ignition switch has made the company the focus of investigations by two congressional committees and federal safety regulators. The company is also the subject of a preliminary inquiry by federal prosecutors who are considering a criminal investigation, according to people familiar with the matter.The House Energy and Commerce Committee, one of the congressional panels preparing for hearings, met Tuesday with GM officials, mainly to review the automaker’s version of events, as laid out in chronologies filed with federal regulators, company officials said. Barra said that she would testify if summoned by Congress to Capitol Hill.Barra has named a former federal prosecutor to lead an internal investigation that could stretch over months to establish a more precise record of “what went wrong and why,” Barra said. “There are no sacred cows,” she said.Barra was noncommittal when asked whether she would waive the immunity GM enjoys from liability claims predating its 2009 bankruptcy and federal bailout. The internal investigation will provide GM with a baseline of facts to guide the company as it moves forward, she said.Vehicle safety advocates have called on GM, whose profits have soared and standing with car buyers has improved since a restructuring, to establish a $1 billion fund to compensate the families of those killed and injured in incidents related to the defective part.GM has paid settlements in several lawsuits over the switch, but it has not released a comprehensive list of such lawsuits or a list of names of those it believes were hurt and killed as a result of the defect.In her remarks to reporters, Barra repeated her apology for the problem and promised to work diligently to resolve it. She also said that repairs resulting from the ignition switch recall should begin by mid-April and be completed by October.The debacle has posed a difficult early test for Barra, who took over as chief executive of GM in January. She said that she first learned of the problem when the company decided in late January that a recall was warranted.Since then, she has pledged GM’s cooperation with the investigations and apologized repeatedly for the deaths and injuries related to the defective ignition switches.“This is a big crisis, and it is going to go on for a while,” said Dan Hill, president of Ervin Hill Strategy, a crisis public relations firm. “They are going to be fighting battles on many fronts. But GM is taking it seriously. They are showing contrition, and the CEO is engaged.”Barra said she is confident that the recalled cars are safe to drive as long as drivers remove all other items from the vehicles’ key rings. She said that if owners are uncomfortable driving the recalled models, dealers will provide them with loaners and rentals. She also reiterated GM’s pledge to reimburse dealers for the cost of providing those cars.The models recalled by GM because of the ignition switch problem are: 2005-07 Cobalts and Pontiac G5s; 2003-07 Saturn Ion compacts; and 2006-07 Chevrolet HHRs, Pontiac Solstices and Saturn Skys.Related:Watchdog group says review identified 303 deaths in GM cars with undeployed air bagsGM announces 3 new recalls, takes $300 million charge                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",
       "8480  WITH EACH announcement and every new revelation, federal transportation officials expose the depths to which Metro’s safety standards have fallen. There are a dozen or so major subway systems across the nation, but only for Metro has the Federal Transit Administration assumed full safety oversight and undertaken a “track integrity safety blitz,” which, having been underway since March, continues to yield unsettling maintenance problems ignored or overlooked by Metro itself.Now comes the National Transportation Safety Board with an assessment that the FTA itself is unequal to the task of ensuring Metrorail’s safety. So not only is Metro unsafe, says the NTSB’s chairman, Christopher Hart, but also its federal overseers are inept — “averse to crafting and enforcing safety regulations and minimum requirements regarding operations, track and equipment and signal and train control systems.” He believes only the Federal Railroad Administration has the competence and muscle to implant a culture of safety at Metro.The NTSB, which is in charge of major accident investigations, delivered its report Tuesday on the L’Enfant Plaza smoke incident of January 2015, which left one passenger dead and scores sickened. For passengers, the report — which details a layered systemic breakdown in the L’Enfant Plaza accident — is the latest blow to whatever confidence remains in Metro.Mr. Hart’s scathing critique notwithstanding, the FTA’s revelations may serve at least one important function: to buy Metro some time, or at least indulgence, to start to drag itself back into some semblance of good repair, a process likely to take years. Passengers who may have howled at single-tracking and other schedule-busting maintenance projects a year or two ago might now forgive quotidian inconveniences on the logic that between delays and derailment, delays look like the better option.A less sanguine scenario is that the findings of federal inspectors — defective rails; red-light-running train operators; trains parked without basic safety precautions to prevent them from rolling down the track — may hasten Metro’s already alarming loss of passengers.Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx is aware of Metro’s underlying problems, namely its unwieldy, possibly unworkable governance structure and unmet liabilities running to billions of dollars. He reckons that fixing those is a non-starter before Metro starts to show improved safety. Hence his focus on the system’s safety shortcomings, with the attendant drama of FTA’s track inspection “blitz.”It’s pleasant to think that a short-term benefit of the “blitz” would be a sense of alarm among lawmakers and officials in Annapolis, Richmond and the District, who, having failed to meet the challenge for decades, are now charged with establishing a permanent safety oversight commission for Metro. Instead, there has been nothing but torpor from Metro’s three local stakeholders. Understandably, the NTSB doubts the localities are up to the job. But the FTA, which has been performing that role on an emergency basis since last fall, is not meant to do it indefinitely.Metro is an orphan, and it is sick. Mr. Foxx has been ringing the alarm after years of official neglect and lack of accountability. Bravo, but alarm-ringing may not be enough.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
       "8481  After days of dire warning, the densely populated Eastern Seaboard felt the first bite of a massive storm that snapped trees, ripped down power lines and flooded streets across the Washington region on Monday.From North Carolina to New England, the coastal states were buttoned up as the big and uniquely formed storm system gained its first hold over land since killing almost 70 people in the Caribbean.New York City was hit hard, with an unprecedented nine-foot storm surge conspiring with rivers already overflowing their banks. Streets flooded in Brooklyn and Lower Manhattan, runways at LaGuardia International Airport were underwater and a big construction crane snapped atop a skyscraper being built in Midtown. Four feet of water had flooded some city subways, raising fears they would cripple the system for days.Late Monday, Mayor Michael Bloomberg said backup power had been lost at New York University hospital and the city was working to move people out, the Associated Press reported. The storm had killed at least one city resident, a man who died when a tree fell on his home in the Flushing section of Queens, according to the wire service.With the storm expected to linger longer than most, virtually everything in and around Washington was to shut down for a second day on Tuesday. The federal workforce and public employees in the District, Maryland and Virginia were told to stay home again. Schools in the District and adjoining states closed. Metro and other transit agencies planned to remain out of service at least Tuesday morning.No flights were expected Tuesday at the region’s three airports. Amtrak service north of the District was not expected to resume at least until Wednesday. Tens of thousands of homes lost power.Gov. Martin O’Malley (D) said his state was “in the crosshairs” of a storm that “is going to .?.?. sit on Maryland and bear down on Maryland for a good 24 to 36 hours.”The days of preparation afforded by the storm’s slow march toward the coast could not save the region from the myriad damage that proves that much of what man makes is no match for hurricane winds and floodwaters.“This is one of, if not the, strongest storms on record in the Mid-Atlantic or Northeast,” said Jason Samenow of The Washington Post’s Capital Weather Gang. “In terms of a prolonged wind and rain event, this will be as strong as anything we’ve seen in several decades.”The central core of Hurricane Sandy turned from the Atlantic into the shoreline near Atlantic City after nightfall Monday, but for all its almost 1,000-mile wingspan, Sandy was just the central element of a massive confluence of weather. Its tropical weather was expected to collide with the jet stream to the west and then be pinned from escape by a powerful nor’easter that will hold it in place over a multistate region where almost 60 million people live.The bizarre combination of a late-season hurricane and a nor’easter, a storm type with some hurricane-like characteristics more common between October and April, was captured by Virginia Gov. Robert F. McDonnell (R).“You’ve got flooding in southeast Virginia,” McDonnell said. “You’ve got a blizzard in western and southwest Virginia. And you’ve got high winds and heavy rain in Northern Virginia.”For the second time in four months, lights flickered out in homes across the Washington region. The three major utilities fought a losing battle through the night to keep the power on, with regional outages reaching almost 160,000 by 9 p.m.“We lost power about 7:50 p.m.” on Monday, said Craig Barnabee of Shady Side. “We last lost it during those straight-line winds in late June, and it was out for two days.”Barnabee said he would start his generator Tuesday morning, but many people were likely to awake in darkness, unsure when their power might be restored.Although advance help had been enlisted from as far as Texas, the region’s utilities were reluctant to promise when lights would come back on. It was expected to remain windy here until Wednesday as the storm moved slowly on a swing through New England.“You have to wait until the wind subsides, then you hit it again as quickly as possible,” said Bob Hainey, spokesman for Pepco, which serves the District and much of the immediate Maryland suburbs. “The big word now is safety, safety, safety.”Pepco had to recall its crews briefly during the height of the Monday night winds because it’s unsafe to use bucket-truck extensions in winds above 35 mph.The National Weather Service warned that the Potomac River on Wednesday and Thursday would probably experience its worst flooding since a rapid snow melt after the blizzard of 1996.Authorities in Virginia said the entire 37-square-mile Chincoteague Island was underwater up to three feet deep. The 3,500 islanders who had opted to remain on Chincoteague were told to stay in place because the causeway to the mainland was closed.“It’s pretty rough,” police chief Edward Lewis said Monday night. “It’s blowing real hard. It’s raining sideways.”Winds are picking up and gusts are bringing trees and power lines down, said Mayor Jack Tarr.The wild ponies the island is known for had been moved to high ground before the storm.McDonnell said he would apply for federal help to cover the cost for repairing public buildings, infrastructure and overtime for public safety officials.Although the very worst of the storm was to have passed by daybreak Tuesday, the last of the wind and rain was expected to linger over the Washington area into Wednesday as the storm system pushed north over land into New England.Even before Sandy reached shore, Atlantic City and its fabled boardwalk had been badly beaten by winds and were under floodwaters. The same was true up and down the coast line.More than 100 feet of the fishing pier in Ocean City was snapped off by the angry surf. Those who ignored evacuation orders were told to stay put while the storm passed.“You run from the water, and you hide from the wind,” said Joseph Theobald, the city’s director of emergency services.Airlines had begun canceling flights up and down the East Coast over the weekend in advance of the storm, and it seemed unlikely local airports would return to normal until later in the week.“When the airlines resume service is dependent upon weather conditions here in Washington, as well as in other cities on the East Coast,” said Jonathan Dean, spokesman for Baltimore-Washington International Marshall Airport. “It may take several days to accommodate the passengers that were disrupted by the canceled flights.”Although Reagan National and Dulles International airports remained open, all flights were canceled Monday after the 9 a.m. departure of a flight from National to Atlanta and a 1:15 p.m. flight from Dulles to Tokyo.At the Dulles Travelers Aid desk, volunteer Don Webster stayed busy all afternoon trying to help stranded passengers with hotel discounts and to book flights for Wednesday. “Because it is an act of God, the airlines are not paying for hotels,” he said as he helped three passengers. “Not much the airline can do about this.”American Airlines spokesman Matt Miller said, “We’re hopeful that operations will resume in some cities on Wednesday, but it’s possible that the aftermath of the storm may force some additional delays and cancellations.”Several hospitals said advance warnings about the storm allowed them to stock up on medication, food, linens and other supplies to last for the next 48 hours. Surgeries and procedures were taking place on schedule Monday, and several hospitals said they expect to remain open and operational Tuesday. But at least one — Washington Adventist Hospital in Takoma Park — canceled elective surgeries for Monday afternoon and Tuesday, a spokeswoman said.Shelters in the District have been planning for several days for the storm, but there hasn’t been the expected influx of occupants yet.“We’re ready for it,” said David Berns, the director of D.C.’s Department of Human Services. “Now w   \n",
       "8482  Contributions to American culture by Indian Americans are highlighted in “Beyond Bollywood: Indian Americans Shape the Nation,” an exhibition by the Smithsonian Asian Pacific American Center opening Feb. 27 at the National Museum of Natural History.With seven sections occupying 5,000 square feet, there’s a bigness to the exhibition reflecting the size of the subcontinent, and more than 200 years of history. Photos, art and artifacts will explore the muscle Indian Americans put into the nation’s railroads and infrastructure, their professional concentrations and achievements, and cultural, religious and civil rights highlights.“We wanted a title that people have a reference for, but this is not about Bollywood,” says curator Masum Momaya. “The exhibition is going to take you beyond what you know about Indians and Indian Americans,” though its color and design draw on Bollywood aesthetics. “The main wall colors are mango, magenta and bright plum. .?.?. Our culture is vibrant, so we wanted the gallery to reflect that.”A focal point of the exhibition will be a dress by designer Naeem Khan worn by First Lady Michelle Obama at the White House’s Governors Dinner in 2012.According to the 2010 Census, 17 million people in the United States are of Asian and Pacific Islander descent and by 2050, that it’s expected to be 41 million. Members of the Indian American community approached the Smithsonian about doing an exhibition in 2008, and curators began a concentrated effort to collect Indian American artifacts from around the country. The Smithsonian’s 137 million-object collection had objects from India, but few from Indian Americans.The exhibition will begin with migrants not only from India, but Indians from the Caribbean, Africa and even South America; a population widely spread throughout the British Empire, of which India was once a part. It includes early immigration history as well as a look at Indian Americans’ concentration as cab drivers, motel and small business owners, doctors and software engineers.In looking at fields in which Indian Americans are concentrated professionally, “we went for the most stereotypical ones with the idea of dismantling the stereotypes,” Momaya says.“Arts and Activism” explores Indian Americans contributions to social justice movements, and a section on religion and spirituality looks specifically at yoga. But it will probably be the section on Indian American cultural contributions — food, fashion, dance, music — that will be the most easily recognizable and feel most resonant. A re-creation of a dining table found in an Indian American family home will feature eight place settings with each symbolizing a moment in food history. These includes the first Indian American restaurants, cookbooks and when grocery stores began selling Indian food.And because so much food history is about family, ritual and lore, the section will have place settings on Thali — the Indian plates that travel well, hold piles of food and last decades. The American dish equivalent, Corelle dinnerware will be on the other side of the table. Indian Americans have “a cultural attraction to Corelle ware,” Momaya enthuses. She still has a set her parents gave her when she went to college. It was inexpensive, durable and families owned “one of three patterns that reminded people of India. Its texture, nuance, emotional resonance. People come in and see it and say wow, I have that same set of dishes in my cupboard today. It’s passing on history in a material sense, but also in terms of memory.”Khan, who designed Michelle Obama’s one-shouldered, sequin- and crystal-embellished gown, hails from a centuries-long line of garment embroiderers from India's Mughal Courts. Throughout the exhibition, that blending of very old, very traditional hallmarks of Indian culture will show up repeatedly, and in surprising ways, in American history and iconography.“I see this exhibition as American history, not just Indian American history,” says Momaya. “There are so many parallels.”“Beyond Bollywood: Indian Americans Shape the Nation”opening Feb. 27 runs through Feb., 2015 at the National Museum of Natural History, 10th St. and Constitution Ave. NW, Washington. 202-633-1000. www.mnh.si.edu.Five others to watch? The Maryland Historical Society in Baltimore is on a roll — albeit a traditional roll, tinged with traces of British aristocracy. Coming off heightened interest in bicentennial commemorations of the War of 1812, it is lending the original Francis Scott Key “Star-Spangled Banner” manuscript to the National Museum of American History for two weeks in June, where it will be displayed, for the first time, with the flag that inspired its creation. An Feb. 6 lecture, “The Artistic Legacy of the Calverts and Arundells in England and America,” promises to add texture and meaning to historic Maryland names many of us know only as exits off the highway. The “Bootleggers Bash: Rebooted” offers a chance to dress up in Prohibition-era clothing, swill beerand celebrate Maryland history. The Historical Society keeps up with the costuming by sponsoring a March 1 bus trip to Winterthur Museum Garden and Library outside Wilmington, Del., to view original costumes from the hit series “Downton Abbey.” The Maryland Historical Society, 201 W.

The Heurich House Museum in Dupont Circle was the residence of local brewer and philanthropist Christian Heurich and is regarded as one of the most intact Victorian houses in the country. It closes yearly in January for maintenance and cleaning of the original furnishings and decorations, but will reopen Feb. 1 . A March launch for the book “Capital Beer” about the city’s beer history features beer tasting. In partnership with the In Series Opera, a salon-style concert, “The Romantics: Schubert and Goethe,” on April 11 and 12 focuses on early German romanticism. And it marks the first public concert using the museum’s hand-painted 1901 Steinway, given to Mrs. Heurich by Mr. Heurich after the birth of their son.

Reynolds Center for American Art and Portraiture. Through photographs, official records, maps and audio interviews, it details the efforts by a special U.S. Army unit of curators, scholars, architects, librarians, and archivists from the U.S. and Britain — Monuments Men — to locate and recover major artworks stolen by the Nazis. With a Hollywood blockbuster of the same name as a tie-in, interest in these compelling pieces of World War II history will be high. “Monuments Men: On the Frontline to Save Europe’s Art, 1942-1946” is open Feb. 7 through April 20 at the Donald W. Reynolds Center for American Art and Portraiture, 8th and F streets NW, Washington. 202-633-7940. www.aaa.si.edu.?In 2012, natural disasters affected 32 states at a cost of over $100 billion and drew increasing attention to the urgency for builders and planners to help mitigate their effects. The “Designing for Disaster ” exhibition opening May 11 at the National Building Museum examines the risks from natural hazards and ways to design and build safer, more disaster-resilient communities. The objects, multimedia and graphics of this exhibition will look at a range of responses to earthquakes, tornadoes, hurricanes and floods. It will show homes on unprotected coastal wetlands, along with disaster-resistant housing and facilities the exhibition Web site says are designed to deal with at least one hazard in an “exemplary,” “pragmatic” and, in some cases, beautiful way. “Designing for Disaster” opens May 11 at the National Building Museum, 401 F St. NW, Washington. 202-272-2448. www.nbm.org. ?This year marks the 50th anniversary of the Sm   \n",
       "8483  It seems odd that something so large and ungainly should have the temerity to call itself “sport.” But such is the case with the larger-than-life Chrysler 300 S, a full-size sedan available with rear-wheel or four-wheel drive.Blame it on marketing — that syrupy mixture of fact and fantasy administered in heavy doses to take the “hard” out of “hard sell.” Consider, for example, the Chrysler 300 without the “S.”It is a large car in the tradition of big Detroit automobiles. It has a bold, brash, in-your-face demeanor. Yet, despite its pugnaciousness, there is something undeniably attractive about it. It is a boat so loaded with standard amenities that you almost don’t care if it stays docked.In fact, you might even prefer it. The Chrysler 300 — 16 feet, 7 inches long — consumes lots of real estate. It is not city-friendly, especially not in hyper-congested places such as New York, where every inch of road space is fiercely contested.And the base Chrysler 300, equipped with Chrysler’s standard 3.6-liter, V-6 gasoline engine (292 horsepower, 260 pound-feet of torque) is a boat with barely adequate power. It offers almost respectable fuel economy, 19 miles per gallon in the city and 31 miles per gallon on the highway, using regular or E85 (85 percent ethanol) gasoline.But you feel the full weight of the car, easily 5,100 pounds with two passengers and cargo, with that V-6 engine. In something as large as the Chrysler 300, it is better to move up the model line and get the available 5.7-liter gasoline V-8 (363 horsepower, 399 pound-feet of torque) and enjoy the power behind the car’s tough-dude mask. You also can up the power ante and get the Chrysler 300 SRT8 equipped with a 6.4-liter gasoline V-8 (470 horsepower, 470 pound-feet of torque).But the higher you move up the 300 line, the more money you spend, hitting a base price of nearly $50,000 for the 300 SRT8, about $20,000 above the base sticker of a standard-equipped Chrysler 300.So, what to do? You want the swagger and power of a Chrysler 300 SRT8, but you can’t afford the cost of that car. In come Chrysler’s marketing people with the 300 S package — the “S” indicating “sport.”It is mostly an appearance and equipment thing that does not really make the big sedan move any faster or handle any better than the base Chrysler 300. You get the same 3.6-liter, V-6 gasoline engine with a slight boost in horsepower — eight more horsepower, increasing maximum output to 300 hp. You get 20-inch diameter wheels instead of the 17-inch wheels sold as standard equipment on the base car. And you get a wonderfully menacing, blacked-out, bad-boy grille and, oh, yes, a big black “S” emblazoned on the face of the front seats of the car.What you don’t get is the 300 SRT8’s power and grunt. But, considering the higher price of that model and the cost of the gasoline needed to satisfy its thirst, it is probably best to go with the “S” appearance package and the available SafetyTec and Uconnect advanced safety technology and navigation packages, which are highly recommended by this column.And don’t fret. Unless you live near a racetrack, have the money to pay for using that facility and have the extra insurance cash to cover the cost of driving a 6.4-liter Chrysler 300 SRT8 the way it was engineered to be driven, you can do without that big engine.Enjoy the Chrysler 300 S. It is a big, comfortable automobile, perfect for driving long stretches of highway that don’t curve much. The SafetyTec package will keep you from swerving into the wrong lane or cutting in front of a vehicle fast approaching on your blind side. It also will automatically adjust your speed and distance while approaching the vehicle in front of you. And the optional Uconnect navigation system, with a standard, easy-to-use 8.4-inch touch screen, is one of the best in the business.Just remember that your 300 S, with a base 3.6-liter V-6, is mostly an equipment package. Don’t try to take on a 300 SRT8, or anything with similar horsepower.Nuts & BoltsChrysler 300Bottom line:?Know what you are buying and why you are buying it, especially when shopping for a multilayered car line such as the Chrysler 300. If you simply want or need a big sedan with reasonable fuel economy, be happy with the base 300. If you just want to look tough, get the 300 S and, maybe, a shrink to help you deal with anger-management issues. If all you want is traditional Detroit big-car luxury, get the exceptionally well-equipped 300 C John Varvatos Luxury edition. If you live near a racetrack and you have the time and money to play there, check out the 300 SRT8 with the 6.4-liter V-8.Ride, acceleration and handling in the 300S 3.6 V-6: It gets acceptable/good marks in all three.Head-turning quotient: The car is more “get out of my way” than “hello.” Put another way: It is more Putin than Obama.Body style/layout: The Chrysler 300 is a front-engine, full-size sedan available with rear-wheel or with four-wheel-drive. It is offered with six equipment levels—300, 300 S, 300 C, 300 C John Varvatos Luxury Edition, 300 SRT8 Core, and the 300 SRT8.Engine/transmission: The car comes standard with a 3.6-liter, gasoline, 24-valve V-6 with variable timing linked to an eight-speed automatic transmission that also can be shifted manually. A 5.7-liter gasoline V-8 is optional for this model.Capacities: Seating is for five people. Long-legged types with tall hairdos report moderately comfortable rear seating. Cargo capacity with all seats in place is 16.3 cubic feet. The fuel tank holds 19.1 gallons of gasoline. Regular grade is okay. E85 (85 percent ethanol) is recommended for lower tailpipe emissions.Mileage: I averaged 27 miles per gallon in mostly highway driving.Safety: Standard equipment includes four-wheel disc brakes (ventilated front/solid rear); four-wheel antilock brake protection; emergency braking assistance; electronic brake-force distribution; electronic stability and traction control; high-intensity discharge headlamps; side and head air bags.Recommended optional safety equipment: Chrysler SafetyTec and Uconnect packages.Pricing: The 2014 Chrysler 300 S comes with a base price of $34,230 and a dealer’s invoice price of $32,756. Price as tested is $45,690 including $10,465 in options (the “S” appearance, SafetyTec and Uconnect packages) and a $995 shipping charge. Dealer’s price as tested is $43,690.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",
       "8484  Last week, we unveiled Wonkblog's first use of the Post's CrowdSourced platform, to spur a discussion of what America's energy future holds. Here are a few of the more interesting comments.Says user ChrisStewart:The largest source of energy reduction will come from the Internet. Video conferencing (read Google Hangout) will reduce travel-related energy costs. Productivity suites will provide better work-from-home support (in your face, Yahoo!). And most importantly, top employees from Amazon will leak into the broader market. These smart people will use the web to improve supply chain management for small businesses, reducing the energy footprint of food delivery and other essential services.Optimistically, I hope that the Internet will move to cleaner sources of energy. This process will happen independently of the above energy saving techniques. If somehow, Amazon, Microsoft, and your local bank all find a way to power their datacenters with renewable power (or at least *not* dirty coal), then our energy future truly will be bright. Note, GreenPeace.org (see \"how clean is your cloud?\") suggests that a renewable-powered Internet is far off. C'est La Vie...Reader KMBelliott writes:Low Energy Nuclear reactions, aka cold fusion, deserve more attention. Cold fusion challenges our understanding of plasma fusion, which leads to its quick dismissal by many. However there is a growing body of research showing the effects are real and replicable.Mark Gibbs of Forbes is doing a good job following one of the more promising prospects. Start here for more. ElSurfeador makes a pitch--or at least a hope--for rapid advancement in solar technology.In an ideal world, solar becomes so efficient and cheap it would be the ultimate source, but not likely for a very long time (especially with cars). An achievable approach though would be to start widespread use of natural gas for vehicles. If there is any kind of \"Moore's Law\" applicable to solar, reliability and efficiency would continue to increase while cost decreases to the point where it can be effectively used for our electrical needs. We will still be a fossil fuel based world for a while but in these two areas significant improvement could be made. Especially if people realized that, aside from any environmental framework, renewable energy could be a viable strategic tool in America's security. If thru wind, solar, nuclear and natural gas we virtually eliminated our use of oil, you'd see the face of the mideast look much different.MelvinUdall suggests that there is a more obvious answer staring us in the face.Fossil Fuels. They are the *only* reliable, abundant source for at least the next thirty years. They will allow for the prosperity necessary for continued technological advancement. Those advancements make fossil fuel production and use cleaner while finding new technologies.The alternative is to deliberately cripple ourselves as other, smarter nations use fossil fuels. Those nations, such as China, India and more, do not care about environmental restrictions as we do. Look at China's air and tell me you want them to be the largest energy producers while we hobble ourselves with \"clean\" technologies that *can't* provide for our energy needs.Truly unleash coal, oil, natural gas and nuclear in America for the next thirty years and by the end of the century fossil fuels can and will be a thing of the past. Continue the suicidal \"green\" con game, worried about the nonexistant anthropogenic climate change while China and India pay them no mind, and we become a permanent second class nation in the 21stC.If LENr can be developed as a conventional energy source society would have unlimited energy with almost zero pollution. Pretty much what everyone is looking for, right?Guy Noir, meanwhile, suggests this:Molten Thorium Salt Reactors.The technology is safe and thorium is plentiful. Additional advantanges include not being able to to processed into nuclear weapons.

       "8485  A close encounter of the rocky kind is set for Feb. 15, when an office-building-size asteroid will speed past Earth faster than a bullet and closer than some communications satellites.It will be the nearest recorded brush with a space rock so large, NASA scientists said Thursday.The good news: There’s no chance of an impact. At its closest, asteroid 2012 DA14 will pass about 17,000 miles above Earth.The bad news: A million other potentially dangerous — and unknown — city-killing space rocks are out there, and one of them could be on a collision course with Earth. Critics say NASA and other space agencies are not doing enough to scan for these threats.“It’s like Mother Nature sending a warning shot across our bow,” said Don Yeomans, who tracks asteroids for the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif.Satellite operators said they were monitoring the asteroid but expected it to safely cruise through a belt of satellites that are about 23,000 miles up.“We’re watching the situation, but there’s not a giant concern,” said Alex Horwitz, spokesman for Intelsat, which operates about 50 communications satellites.The Air Force, meanwhile, is leaving the tracking to NASA.An astronomer in Spain discovered the asteroid a year ago. Small, dim and speedy, it was a “slippery target” as it moved across a background of stars, said Jaime Nomen of the La Sagra Observatory in southern Spain.NASA-funded scientists then ran the numbers: The asteroid was about 150 feet wide. Its closest approach will occur at 2:24 p.m. Eastern time on the 15th. On the night side of the planet — mainly Asia and Australia — observers with small telescopes might see a pinpoint streaking at the rapid clip of two moon-widths per minute.Further observations refined the asteroid’s path. It cruises around the sun in an orbit almost identical to Earth’s. Our year is 365 days. Its year is a day longer. Like a drunk driver weaving across lanes, asteroid 2012 DA14 crosses paths with Earth twice a year, at varying distances.Despite these opportunities for disaster, scientists tracking the asteroid are confident 2012 DA14 won’t collide with us for at least the next century, which is as far as they’ve been able to project its path. Next week’s approach is the closest during that time.NASA began rigorously scanning the sky for cosmic hazards only in 1998, when Congress told it to. Agency scientists said Thursday they are confident their network of ground and space telescopes have found at least 95 percent of potentially planet-killing asteroids, those a half-mile wide or more. None of these monsters is headed toward Earth, Yeomans said. ?But the agency has done much worse identifying smaller threats, said Ed Lu, a former NASA astronaut. Lu spearheads the B612 Foundation, which last year began raising private funds to build an asteroid-spotting space telescope.“Saying we’re only going to find the civilization-killers is a [sub-par] threshold,” Lu said. “We can do better than that.”Lu said that so far the human race has spotted only about 1 percent of the smaller, but still dangerous, asteroids near Earth.Scars on our planet’s surface reveal a long history of violent, even cataclysmic, collisions.An asteroid the size of 2012 DA14 could wipe out a city, Yeomans said. It would explode with a force of 21 / 2 megatons of TNT — a nuclear bomb nearly 1,000 times more powerful than the one exploded over Hiroshima in 1945.There is only one recent impact of a space rock so large. In 1908, an asteroid or cometary fragment plowed into Siberia. The “Tunguska Event,” named for the unlucky but unpopulated locale, flattened millions of trees across nearly 1,000 square miles.Meteor Crater in Arizona — nearly a mile wide — was also probably gouged by an office-building-size space rock about 50,000 years ago.Moving up the scale of destruction, a “planet killer” about five miles wide slammed into the Gulf of Mexico 65 million years ago, most scientists say, triggering a planet-wide cataclysm that wiped out the dinosaurs. That scenario, once heavily debated, appears more certain after a study published Thursday in the journal Science found that most dinosaurs went extinct relatively soon after that collision. With the dinosaurs gone, mammals thrived, eventually evolving into people.“I think it’s fair to say, without the dinosaurs having gone extinct, we would not be here,” Paul Renne, director of the Berkeley Geochronology Center and leader of the study, told the Associated Press.Much smaller fragments — leftovers from the dawn of the solar system — skip into our atmosphere every day, sometimes streaking spectacularly across the sky as meteors. Car-size rocks arrive at a clip of about once per year.Asteroids as big as 2012 DA14 are expected to hit Earth much less frequently — about once every 1,200 years, Yeomans said.What to do if scientists detect an asteroid headed for Earth? Given enough lead time — say, 30 or 40 years — deflecting the threat will be feasible, Lu said. “If something’s going to hit, we’re going to pull out all the stops.”A Hollywood favorite — nuclear bombs — might work, as might gentler means such as parking a spacecraft near the asteroid so that its gravity pulls it to a safe orbit. Last year, the European Commission launched the NEOShield project to start planning such missions.“The hard part,” Lu said, “is finding the million or so asteroids this size or larger and getting advance notice.” If 2012 DA14 had been on a collision course for next week, the year-long lead time since its discovery would have been too brief to launch a deflection mission, said Lu.The B612 Foundation has raised a “few million dollars,” spokeswoman Diane Murphy said, but it needs $30 million or $40 million a year to build their telescope, which would scan the entire sky for city-killer-size rocks.Lindley Johnson, who heads NASA’s $6 million annual program to find near-Earth threats, acknowledged that the agency could do better. “We still have a lot of improvement to make in finding all of the hazardous asteroids,” he said.Case in point: The sky-scanning camera that first spotted asteroid 2012 DA14 was purchased not by NASA, but by a small nonprofit group, the Planetary Society.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",
       "8486  The controversial discovery of 68-million-year-old soft tissue from the bones of a Tyrannosaurus rex finally has an explanation: According to new research, iron in the dinosaur’s body preserved the tissue before it could decay.The research, headed by Mary Schweitzer, a molecular paleontologist at North Carolina State University, explains how proteins — and possibly even DNA — can survive for millennia. Schweitzer and her colleagues first raised this question in 2005, when they found the seemingly impossible: soft tissue preserved inside the leg of an adolescent T. rex unearthed in Montana.“What we found was unusual, because it was still soft and still transparent and still flexible,” Schweitzer said. [See Images of a Near-Complete T. rex]T. rex tissue?The find was also controversial, because scientists had thought proteins that make up soft tissue should degrade in less than a million years in the best of conditions. In most cases, microbes feast on a dead animal’s soft tissue, destroying it within weeks. The tissue found in Montana must be something else, perhaps the product of a later bacterial invasion, critics argued.In 2007, Schweitzer and her colleagues analyzed the chemistry of the T. rex proteins. They found that the proteins really had come from dinosaur soft tissue. The tissue was collagen, they reported in the journal Science, and it shared similarities with bird collagen — which makes sense, because modern birds evolved from theropod dinosaurs such as T. rex.The researchers also analyzed other fossils for the presence of soft tissue and found that it was present in about half of their samples going back to the Jurassic period, which lasted from 145.5 million to 199.6 million years ago, Schweitzer said.“The problem is, for 300 years, we thought, ‘Well, the organics are all gone, so why should we look for something that’s not going to be there?’ and nobody looks,” she said.The obvious question, though, was how soft, pliable tissue could survive for millions of years. In a study published last week, Schweitzer thinks she has the answer: iron.Iron ladyIron is an element present in abundance in the body, particularly in the blood, where it is part of the protein that carries oxygen from the lungs to the tissues. Iron is also highly reactive with other molecules, so the body keeps it locked up tight, bound to molecules that prevent it from wreaking havoc on the tissues.After death, though, iron is set free from its cage. It forms minuscule iron nanoparticles and also generates free radicals, which are highly reactive molecules thought to be involved in aging.“The free radicals cause proteins and cell membranes to tie in knots,” Schweitzer said. “They basically act like formaldehyde.”Formaldehyde, of course, preserves tissue. It works by linking up, or cross-linking, the amino acids that make up proteins, a process that makes those proteins more resistant to decay.Schweitzer and her colleagues found that dinosaur soft tissue is closely associated with iron nanoparticles in both the T. rex soft-tissue specimen and another from Brachylophosaurus canadensis, a duck-billed dinosaur. They then tested the iron-as-preservative idea using modern ostrich blood vessels. They soaked one group of blood vessels in iron-rich liquid made of red blood cells and another group in water. The blood vessels left in water turned into a disgusting mess within days. The blood vessels soaked in red blood cells remain recognizable after sitting at room temperature for two years. [Paleo-Art: Illustrations Bring Dinosaurs to Life]Searching for soft tissueDinosaurs’ iron-rich blood, combined with a good environment for fossilization, may explain the amazing existence of soft tissue from the Cretaceous period — which lasted from about 65.5 million to 145.5 million years ago — and even earlier. The specimens Schweitzer works with, including skin, show evidence of excellent preservation. The bones of these specimens are articulated, not scattered, suggesting they were buried quickly. They’re also buried in sandstone, which is porous and may wick away bacteria and reactive enzymes that would otherwise degrade the bone.Schweitzer is set to search for more dinosaur soft tissue next summer. “I’d like to find a honking big T. rex that’s completely articulated that’s still in the ground, or something similar,” she said. To preserve the chemistry of potential soft tissue, the specimens must not be treated with preservatives or glue, as most fossil bones are, she said. And they need to be tested quickly, because soft tissue may degrade once exposed to modern air and humidity.Importantly, Schweitzer and her colleagues have figured out how to remove the iron from their samples, which enables them to analyze the original proteins. They’ve even found proteins that are chemically consistent with being DNA, though Schweitzer is quick to note that she hasn’t proved they really are DNA. The iron-removing techniques should allow paleontologists to search more effectively for soft tissue and to test it when they find it.“Once we can get the chemistry behind some of these soft tissues, there’s all sorts of questions we can ask of ancient organisms,” Schweitzer said.— LiveScience Image Gallery: The Life of T.

       "8487  According to more than 60 percent of technology experts interviewed by the Pew Internet and American Life Project, a major cyberattack will happen between now and 2025 and it will be extensive enough to cause “significant loss of life or property losses/damage/theft at the levels of tens of billions of dollars.” Preventing a cyber attack of that magnitude – what former U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta famously referred to as a “cyber Pearl Harbor” in 2012 — will require a tremendous amount of innovative thinking from our nation’s military leaders.The reason, quite simply, is that, given the shadowy nature of cyberattacks, we may not even know the true enemy, the full extent of the damage, or even how the attack was pulled off. In the digital era, a full frontal attack from a known assailant, similar to (what appears to be) a North Korean hacker attack on Sony Pictures is unlikely. In that case, you have known damage, a clear motive (retaliation for an upcoming film critical of North Korea), and an unfriendly state government calling the cyberattack “a righteous deed.” In contrast, dealing with shadowy digital adversaries is much more difficult.The good news is that Ashton “Ash” Carter, the man tapped to become the next U.S. Defense Secretary, is a science guy, a policy wonk and someone who’s big on cybersecurity. And, based on his efforts to reorganize the nation’s Cyber Command and remarks he’s made at the Aspen Security Forum in July 2013, he also appears to be at the forefront of bringing innovation to the way the nation’s military thinks about cyber warfare.Take, for example, the difficult task of drawing a red line at what constitutes a cyber attack against the United States and then determining the appropriate response. We’ve already seen this with the U.S. government’s difficulty in responding to suspected China cyberattacks — if you don’t know exactly what’s happening and who’s doing it, it’s hard to get someone to stop. North Korean hackers possibly attacking a major Hollywood studio may get all the attention these days, but the more real concern is Russian hackers breaking into NATO or the White House, or Chinese hackers launching round after round of corporate espionage attacks.And those are just the attacks we know about. The real threat could come from almost anywhere — a bunch of rogue hackers from, say, ISIS or Al-Qaeda – or even a domestic cyber threat, in the form of someone such as Edward Snowden threatening to bring down the whole system. If there’s a Stuxnet virus going around capable of taking down Iranian nuclear reactors, it’s safe to assume that, eventually, there could be viruses capable of taking down American nuclear reactors as well.And then there’s the shifting notion of what the military should actually be defending. As Ashton Carter explained at the Aspen Security Forum, the defense establishment needs to think about defending military networks as well as the nation’s private sector networks. This is a fundamentally new threat — and will require much more coordination between the private sector and the defense industry, especially because so much of the nation’s infrastructure — think power plants and the grid — are generally viewed as vulnerable to a potential attack.It’s not for nothing that Henry Kissinger has written in his new book that “cyberspace challenges all historical experience.” The preeminent realist of our era — even if he freely admits that he doesn’t know how the Internet works — fundamentally grasps the Internet as a tool of power. Cyberspace means that geopolitical rivals now have the ability “to access the cyber domain to disable and potentially destroy critical infrastructure from a position of near-complete anonymity.” That, of course, leads to the shifting notion of what “offensive capabilities” mean in the modern digital age. What do you do if someone’s attacked your infrastructure? In the 20th century, “offensive capabilities” referred to tanks, planes and missiles. In the digital era, they are tools like viruses and malware. Carter refers to these tools as the ability to “nullify cyberadvantage on the part of others” — partially in recognition that any new technologies in the hands of the U.S. military — and we’ve already seen this with drones — are bound to cause a lot of concern. “It’s a new field of warfare. Obviously, we want to do things as we try always to do, in a way that is lawful and in a way that our population can support and is consistent with our values,” he explained.Of course, there are some who discount the threat of a cyber Pearl Harbor. They claim that it is overhyped, that it’s just a “myth” and that it’s just a way to sell more virus prevention software, or a way to shift private sector costs of defending computer networks on to the government sector. Fair enough. But, let’s face it, that’s probably the same type of thinking that made a Japanese attack 73 years ago seem so unlikely or a 9/11 attack seem unfathomable just 13 years ago. There are so many unknown unknowns that it’s easy just to assume the problem doesn’t exist.Whether you believe in the threat of cyber Pearl Harbor or not, it’s clear that innovative thinking will be required to address emerging new cyber threats — and soon. In order to prevent a cyber Pearl Harbor, we’ll need fewer military guys and more cyber guys. Right now, there are about 4,000 members of the U.S. Cyber Command. These are the people who will be forced to make a judgment call when an attack has taken place, estimate the full extent of the damage and then figure out how to retaliate using the types of new offensive capabilities that have emerged in just the last few years.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",
       "8488  House Republicans narrowly approved a sweeping overhaul of the nation’s food stamp program Thursday that would slash about $39 billion in funding over the next decade, cut aid to about 4 million Americans in the next few years and shift the burden of providing aid to some of the nation’s poor to state governments.The GOP-backed plan differs sharply from a bipartisan Senate proposal passed in June, and its passage will further strain relations between the two chambers as they spend the next several weeks toiling over a short-term budget deal and negotiating over raising the federal debt limit.As those battles begin, Thursday’s vote is a victory for House Majority Leader Eric I. Cantor (R-Va.), who orchestrated a strategy this summer to split apart the farm bill to consider funding for food stamps, or the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, separately from legislation authorizing crop subsidies and an overhaul of many agricultural and conservation programs.Cantor said the deep cuts enacted Thursday were necessary because while most SNAP recipients need the assistance, there are too many people “that choose to abuse the system.”“Frankly it’s wrong for hard-working middle-class Americans to pay for that,” Cantor said.Rep. Tim Huelskamp (R-Kan.), a strong supporter of the bill, said that stiffer work requirements for certain adults applying for SNAP funds mean “you can no longer sit on your couch…and expect the federal taxpayer to feed you.”The House voted 217 to 210, with all members of the Democratic caucus present voting against the plan. The House can now begin long-delayed negotiations with the Senate over a final version of the farm bill, which would once again merge food aid with other agricultural policy.But in a rambling speech on the Senate floor Thursday morning, Majority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.) slammed the GOP strategy, saying that Republicans have “turned their backs” on low-income families in hopes of making budget cuts. Citing his frequent trips to the grocery store with his wife, Landra, Reid said that proposed cuts in SNAP funding would make it difficult for some recipients to buy hamburger meat and milk in the same shopping trip.In the House, Democrats used the hours before the vote to criticize Republicans for stripping SNAP recipients of their aid. They repeatedly cited an op-ed by former Senate majority leaders Tom Daschle (D-S.D.) and Robert Dole (R-Kan.) published Monday in the Los Angeles Times who argued that “this is no time to play politics with hunger.”Brandishing a cooked steak, bottle of vodka and can of caviar on the House floor, Rep. Jackie Speier (D-Calif.) suggested that money spent by lawmakers on official overseas travel could easily help pay for food stamps for the hungry. One lawmaker received more than $3,500 to spend on food and lodging during a six-day trip to Russia — roughly equal to a year’s worth of SNAP funding for some recipients, she said.The House bill would cut overall SNAP spending by slightly more than five percent over the next decade, largely through two provisions that would significantly affect states.The first reinstates restrictions on many able-bodied, childless adults aged 18 to 50 who receive SNAP benefits. It accounts for roughly half the cuts. Under those limits, 1.7 million people would lose benefits next year, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office reported on Monday. Under federal law, those able-bodied adults may collect only limited benefits — up to three months over a three-year period — unless they work more than 20 hours per week or are in a job-training program.RELATED GRAPHIC:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",
       "8489  With Metro’s L’Enfant Plaza station closed after heavy smoke in a tunnel forced the evacuation of hundreds of riders and shut down service for a large portion of the Green and Yellow lines Monday afternoon, Metro officials announced several service adjustments for Tuesday morning’s commute.Here’s what you can expect:All Yellow Line service will be replaced with additional Blue Line trains operating between Huntington and Largo Town Center, via Rosslyn. Trains on this route will depart every 12 minutes. Use Green Line trains for service between Greenbelt and downtown D.C.Blue Line trains between Franconia-Springfield and Van Dorn Street will operate every 12 minutes. Trains will run every six minutes at all other Blue Line stations.Orange Line trains will run every 8 minutes between Vienna and New Carrollton.Silver Line trains will run every 12 minutes between Wiehle-Reston East and Largo Town Center, with many trains expanded to 8-cars long to provide additional capacity.Metro said there is normal service on the Green Line. Trains will run every six minutes between Greenbelt and Branch Avenue.Red Line service is unaffected and will operate on a regular weekday schedule.Metro said limited shuttle buses are available between Pentagon and L’Enfant Plaza. Shuttle buses are running every 20 minutes and boarding from the lower level of Pentagon’s bus bays and at L’Enfant from 7th Street SW and Maryland Avenue.Regular Metrobus and Circulator bus service may provide a good alternate travel option for some riders.

       "8490  Iran's journalists in chains from Committee to Protect Journalists on Vimeo.Journalism can be a tough gig for Iranians, who face secrecy and the risk of retribution, and it seems to be getting tougher. A video by the Committee to Protect Journalists shows a rising trend in reporters being imprisoned for such charges as \"insulting the supreme leader\" or \"spreading propaganda against the state;\" in other words, for doing journalism. Some have faced solitary confinement, forced confessions, even death.That trend started getting worse, the press freedom group says, shortly after Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was elected president in late 2005. And it got much, much worse after the disputed 2009 presidential election, in which mass protests called for a recount but were ultimately put down by security forces.Here, from a recent Committee to Protest Journalists report on Iranian press freedom abuses, is the cumulative – and, presumably, desired – effect of those arrests. (My emphasis added.)As devastating as the imprisonments are to the individual journalists and their families, the Iranian government’s tactics have had an intimidating effect on the press, choking off the flow of information. This census and CPJ’s past surveys are simply snapshots in time—they do not include the large numbers of journalists convicted of crimes or facing charges who are temporarily free on bail or furlough. Iran has pursued a revolving-door policy in imprisoning journalists, freeing some detainees on short-term furloughs even as they make new arrests. The pattern of rotating critical journalists in and out of prison has sown fear and self-censorship across the entire press corps, according to CPJ research. At least 68 Iranian journalists fled into exile between 2007 and 2012 due to harassment and the threat of imprisonment, according to CPJ research. Only Somali journalists have gone into exile in higher numbers during that period.The Washington Post's Jason Rezaian reported in January about Iranian journalists who had been arrested for allegedly working with foreign media such as the BBC.

       "8491  The number of patients harmed by contaminated medical scopes in recent years far exceeds previous estimates from federal regulators, according to findings in a Senate health committee report published Wednesday.During a three-year stretch from 2012 to 2015, specialized devices known as duodenoscopes were linked to more than two dozen outbreaks of antibiotic-resistant infections that sickened at least 250 patients in the United States and Europe, the inquiry found. It also details a woefully inadequate warning system, in which manufacturers failed to inform health officials to potential problems linked to their devices, hospitals failed to alert federal regulators about outbreaks and the Food and Drug Administration was slow to identify the problem and alert the public.“Patients should be able to trust that the devices they need for treatment are safe and effective,\" Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.), whose staff began investigating the issue a year ago, said in a statement. \"Unfortunately, this investigation makes clear that current policies for monitoring medical device safety put patients at risk, and in this case, allowed tragedies to occur that could have, and should have, been prevented.\"Duodenoscopes are used in hundreds of thousands of procedures each year in the United States to drain fluids from pancreatic and bile ducts blocked by cancer tumors, gallstones and other conditions. During a typical procedure, a flexible, lighted tube is threaded down the throat and stomach and into the top of the small intestine. Unlike other endoscopes, duodenoscopes have a movable “elevator” mechanism at one end that allows the instrument to maneuver into ducts and fix fluid-drainage problems. That intricate design can make the devices difficult to sterilize between uses.[Tracking a superbug outbreak: 'The big question is, why did it take so long?']Doctors consider duodenoscopes an important tool in detecting and treating medical problems early and in a minimally invasive way. But in recent years, the devices also have been linked to the spread of a growing number of antibiotic-resistant \"superbug\" infections.An outbreak involving contaminated scopes last year at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center in Los Angeles left at least two people dead, and officials said scores of other patients potentially were exposed to the dangerous bacteria. At Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, also in Los Angeles, four patients were infected by a superbug after undergoing a duodenoscope procedure. A Connecticut hospital said it had contacted nearly 300 patients who might have been exposed to a dangerous type of drug-resistant E. coli after undergoing duodenoscope procedures.Since 2012, other outbreaks have occurred at Advocate Lutheran General Hospital near Chicago, where 44 people were infected, and at the Virginia Mason Medical Center in Seattle, where at least 32 patients became ill and 11 died.Such incidents prompted the FDA in February to alert doctors and hospitals that duodenoscopes can be difficult to sanitize between uses and “may facilitate the spread of deadly bacteria.” The agency also sent warning letters to the primary manufacturers of the devices -- Olympus, Pentax and Fujifilm -- saying the companies failed to adequately report problems with the devices and, in some instances, failed to ensure that they could be cleaned properly between uses.But Wednesday's Senate report documents a deeper history of infections linked to tainted scopes than previously reported. Investigators detailed dozens of outbreaks at hospitals from New York to Florida to Wisconsin, as well as overseas as hospitals in Germany, France and the Netherlands. \"These outbreaks infected at least 250 people with life-threatening illnesses, including carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE), a dangerous superbug that is resistant to our most potent antibiotics and that kills about half of those it infects,\" they wrote.The report spreads blame among device manufacturers, hospitals and the FDA, as well as what investigators say is an insufficient, outdated system of oversight that prevents health officials from spotting potential problems with medical devices in general. Device manufacturers failed to adequately test whether their scopes could be properly cleaned in a real-world setting, and didn't meet requirements to self-report problems quickly to regulators. Many hospitals also were slow to report infections to manufacturers and federal agencies. And the FDA, in part hamstrung by an ineffective surveillance system, failed to spot the deadly infections linked to contaminated scopes quickly or to alert the public. The report calls for a series of legislative and regulatory changes aimed at helping officials more rapidly identify and combat problems with medical devices.The FDA said in a statement it will “carefully consider” the recommendations from Wednesday’s report, and that mitigating the risk of deadly infections associated with duodenoscopes is a “top priority” for the agency.“We agree with the senator that a broader approach to understanding how well duodenoscope devices work in real-time use is critical to public health,” the agency wrote. “The FDA has taken several actions to address the issue of duodeoscope-related infections and will continue to work to protect patients, while ensuring access to these important devices for those who may benefit from minimally invasive procedures.”Mark Miller, a spokesman for Olympus Corp. of the Americas, said the company had cooperated with Senate investigators, providing documents and answering questions. \"Although we do not agree with all of the report’s conclusions, we are closely reviewing the recommendations in the report as part of Olympus’ ongoing efforts to increase patient safety associated with use of Olympus duodenoscopes.” A spokeswoman for Pentax said the company is reviewing Wednesday's report and that it \"will continue to work with Congress, FDA and the industry to reduce the risk of infection in flexible endoscopy.\" A spokeswoman for Fujifilm said patient safety remains the company's top priority, \"and we are committed to working together with all stakeholders, including patients, hospitals, regulators and lawmakers, to ensure the long-term sustainable use of duodenoscopes.\"This post has been updated.READ MORE:FDA warns about medical scopes after ‘superbug’ hits California hospitalFDA nominee sails through Senate committee, but could a fish stand in his way?Prescription drug prices jumped more than 10 percent in 2015, analysis finds‘What can we do better?’ Trying to make the nation’s food system safer in 2016.How cancer will affect Americans in 2016 — in seven charts                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",

       "8493  Dear readers:This is a day that my family and I never expected to come. The Washington Post Company is selling the newspaper it has owned and nurtured for eight decades.In addition to The Washington Post, the company is selling Greater Washington Publishing, the Gazette newspapers, Express, El Tiempo Latino and Robinson Terminal.The buyer is one of America’s great innovators and most respected business leaders, Jeff Bezos, chief executive officer and founder of Amazon.com. Mr. Bezos is making this acquisition in his personal capacity and not as part of Amazon.The board of our parent corporation, including my uncle and company chairman Don Graham, made this decision with a heavy heart but with an absolute conviction that Mr. Bezos’s ownership represents a unique and extraordinary opportunity for The Washington Post and for you, our readers.In Mr. Bezos we have found an owner who will continue the tradition that the Graham family started with the purchase of The Washington Post by Eugene Meyer in 1933. Since then, and most especially over the past four decades, The Washington Post has earned a worldwide reputation for tough, penetrating, insightful, and indispensable journalism. With the investment by Mr. Bezos, that tradition will continue.Mr. Bezos is widely known, of course, as the founder and CEO of Amazon.com. He is a proven entrepreneur who, like the Graham family and this company, takes the long-term view in his investments. While he expects The Post to remain profitable, his focus is on the essential role that our journalism has on dialogue and the flow of information in our society.Mr. Bezos knows as well as anyone the opportunities that come with revolutionary technology when we understand how to make the most of it. Under his ownership and with his management savvy, we will be able to accelerate the pace and quality of innovation.Mr. Bezos has asked that I remain as Publisher and CEO of The Post.

       "8494  A U.S. jury on Thursday convicted two accused Los Zetas drug cartel hit men of killing U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Special Agent Jaime Zapata and wounding another ICE agent in a February 2011 roadside shooting in Mexico.A jury of seven men and five women in Washington deliberated less than five hours before finding Jose Emanuel Garcia Sota, 35, known as “Safado,” and Jesus Ivan Quezada Piña, 29, known as “Loco,” guilty on four counts each including murder and attempted murder of a U.S. officer and firearms violations.U.S. District Judge Royce C. Lamberth scheduled an Aug. 29 hearing to set a sentencing date after prosecutors coordinate the attendance of the families of Zapata, 32, and Victor Avila Jr., 44, who live in Texas.In a statement, U.S. attorney Channing D. Phillips said the verdicts brought to seven the number of Los Zetas cartel members convicted of the botched afternoon carjacking attempt on Feb. 15, 2011, that resulted in the death of Zapata, the first U.S. law enforcement agent killed in the line of duty in Mexico since 1985.U.S. authorities in May 2013 announced guilty pleas by Zetas cartel commander Julian Zapata Espinoza, known as “El Piolin,” 35, for leading the attack, and other members of two alleged, four-man hit squads on related charges. Several face the possibility of mandatory life sentences, and three testified in this month’s trial.“The victims of this horrific assault were in Mexico on official business serving our country,” Phillips said. “The prosecution of these defendants is a testament to the enormous resources devoted to this investigation by law enforcement in the United States and Mexico.”Reached by telephone, Avila, said “I’m glad that justice has been served for Jaime Zapata.” Avila retired from ICE in 2015 and made his first public comments on the shooting in his testimony during the 12-day trial in Washington.“It’s still not over,” Avila said, saying he and Zapata’s family would seek life sentences for their assailants and would continue seeking records and help from Congress about what the U.S. government knew about the attack. “Despite the guilty verdict, there are still many questions that have not been answered, specifically from” the Department of Homeland Security, ICE’s parent department, Avila said.Families have criticized ICE for sending the men with inadequate security, and questioned the role of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. In March, the Justice Department’s inspector general found that two of the weapons used in Zapata’s killing were trafficked by suspects whom ATF in Dallas had under surveillance but had not arrested.Benigno Trey Martinez III, an attorney for Zapata’s parents, Mary and Amador Zapata Jr., of Brownsville, Tex., said “they were very emotional” when he told them of the verdict. “All that Mr. and Mrs. Zapata have ever wanted is justice for Jaime. I know they look forward to facing each of these defendants and having an opportunity to speak their mind before the judge at time of sentencing.”The jury foreman, who was interviewed separately and spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals by the cartel, said, “This was a horrific crime, perpetrated by individuals who were brutal and hateful, and the decisions that they made in their lives that brought them to this point exemplify the worst in humanity.”Zapata’s death highlighted American involvement in the U.S.-backed drug war in Mexico. The manhunt for those responsible for his death — and tougher sanctions — helped fragment what once was known as Mexico’s most technologically sophisticated and violent paramilitary criminal organizations.Drug violence-related homicides are surging again in Mexico after dipping since 2011, and extraditions continue, including those of two former Mexican state governors accused of corruption at the hands of the Zetas.U.S. authorities have also sought the extradition of Miguel Angel Treviño Morales, the reported leader of Los Zetas known as “Z-40,” who has been suspected in the ambush of the ICE agents and other Americans, and is under indictment in the District, New York City and Texas.Court-appointed attorneys for Garcia Sota and Quezada Piña had argued that no physical evidence tied the men to the crime, only the at times contradictory and shifting testimony of cooperating Zetas witnesses seeking to avoid mandatory life prison sentences.“The speed with which the verdict was returned suggest to me the jury was motivated by the raw emotion of this case,” said Robert A.

       "8495  Among Capitol Hill staffers, no rumor travels faster than one involving free food.So, when word got out last week that Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.) had installed a commercial-sized freezer in her office lobby stocked with gratis ice-cream treats, the resulting stampede was as predictable as a party-line vote.But those who arrived a day late to the run on the sweets were out of luck. One staffer from a nearby office found the case locked, and was turned away, cone-less.“While we’re pleased the freezer has generated such interest and a number of wistful, longing glances from other offices, its sweet, chilly contents are reserved for Sen. McCaskill’s constituents who are visiting Washington this summer,” her spokeswoman tells us.Most congressional offices offer treats to vistitors made in their home states or districts (it’s impossible to leave a Georgia member’s office without a bag or three of peanuts). Ethics rules allow members to accept such goods from manufacturers back home, making the arrangement an all-around win: it’s good publicity for the companies, and members like the chance to offer guests a little something. (Hey, with Congress’ approval-rating at an all-time low, who wouldn’t want to throw in a free candy bar with that governance?).While the snacks are most often given to folks on business visits or in tour groups, aides from neighboring offices sometimes drop by to partake. McCaskill’s ice-cream lockdown is a testament to the novelty of the offering — and the sweltering temperatures. And, it turns out, it’s only for a limited time.The freezer in the Missouri Democrat’s digs is on loan for the month of July, aka, National Ice Cream Month, from Unilever, which produces frozen favorites like Breyers, Good Humor, and Klondike, at its Missouri plant.So get them while — and if — you can.And if not, there are plenty of other goodies available. Here are some of the most popular items up for grabs in Senate offices, according to staffers:Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) — Dr. Pepper and DoritosSen.

       "8496  Saturn's moon Titan has been called the most Earthlike world found to date. It's the only other place in the solar system where stable liquid sits on the surface — seas of liquid methane flow into channels that have created magnificent canyons — and scientists have suggested that the icy world might be able to support some kind of alien life.Now researchers think they can add yet another \"Earthlike\" quality to Titan's extensive list: According to a study in Geophysical Research Letters, a seemingly impossible cloud on Titan may be created by weather processes we've seen before at home.The unlikely cloud type was first spotted decades ago by NASA's Voyager 1 spacecraft. It was made of a carbon- and nitrogen-based compound called dicyanoacetylene (C4N2). C4N2 is part of the chemical cocktail that cloaks Titan in an orange-colored haze. But high up in the stratosphere where this particular cloud sat, the compound was scarce. Scientists could find just 1 percent of the amount of C4N2 that should have been needed to create the cloud.NASA's Cassini mission recently spotted a second example of this crazy kind of cloud. When they used Cassini's instruments to puzzle out the chemical composition of the ice cloud and its surroundings, scientists came up with the same impossible answer: The stratosphere-dwelling ice cloud is made of dicyanoacetylene, but the stratosphere is sorely lacking in that particular compound.Clouds aren't unusual on Titan — they form when methane cools and condenses, just as clouds made of water form on Earth. Things are a little different when they form in the stratosphere — at the moon's poles, circulation patterns force warm gasses down until they sink, cool and condense — but in both cases, the clouds form when ice and vapor reach a state of equilibrium.In the case of these strange ice clouds on Titan, the amount of dicyanoacetylene vapor present in the area shouldn't be enough to keep the ice trapped in the cloud in equilibrium.\"The appearance of this ice cloud goes against everything we know about the way clouds form on Titan,\" lead study author Carrie Anderson of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center said in a statement.But Anderson and her colleagues think they've found an answer — in the clouds that damage Earth's ozone layer.Earth has certain clouds that forego condensation altogether, forming instead through a kind of \"solid-state\" chemistry based on the interactions of ice particles. On Earth, these guys are bad news: Chlorine-based chemicals enter the air by way of pollution on the ground, then meet up with icy water crystals in the dry stratosphere. The chemical reactions that occur in these wispy clouds release chlorine molecules, which eat away at the ozone layer.On Titan, a similar process could create the mysterious ice clouds: Anderson and her colleagues suggest that cyanoacetylene, a more common compound containing hydrogen, carbon and nitrogen, could become coated with hydrogen cyanide as it moved down the stratosphere in the form of icy crystals. If ultraviolet rays from the sun struck one of these dual-layer ice crystals, the resulting chemical reaction would release dicyanoacetylene and hydrogen. Voila, a cloud!\"The compositions of the polar stratospheres of Titan and Earth could not differ more,\" Goddard's Michael Flasar said in a statement. \"It is amazing to see how well the underlying physics of both atmospheres has led to analogous cloud chemistry.\"The Cassini orbiter has been studying Saturn and its wonderful moons for over a decade, but the mission is coming to a close. The mission will end in September 2017, but first NASA is undertaking a \"Grand Finale\" in April. Cassini will dive into the space between Saturn and its rings — an area never before visited — 22 times. On Sept. 15, 2017, Cassini will dive for the last time, plunging into Saturn's atmosphere to send home unprecedented data on the planet's composition.\"We may be counting down, but no one should count Cassini out yet,\" Cassini program scientist Curt Niebur said in a statement. \"The journey ahead is going to be a truly thrilling ride.\"Read More:Water bears’ latest superpower: Proteins that protect them from radiationHow black widow mothers control their children’s cannibalism Dear Science: How does heavy rain stay up in the clouds?NASA just found a spacecraft that’s been lost for two years                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",
       "8497  Metro Transit Police plans to run an emergency response drill at Stadium-Armory station on Sunday morning.The drill is one of a series to improve emergency responders training after the Jan. 12 fatal smoke incident in the tunnel outside the L’Enfant Plaza.The drill will begin at 7:45 a.m. and end around 10 a.m. Sunday. More than 100 emergency responders— including members of the D.C. Police Department and the D.C. Homeland Security Management Agency— will simulate a smoke and fire incident in the tunnel.The Stadium-Armory station will be closed during the exercise. The station is one of four Orange Line stations scheduled to be closed this weekend while crews work on the tracks between Eastern Market and Cheverly as part of Metro’s rebuilding plans. Buses will replace trains between Eastern Market and Cheverly on the Orange Line and between Eastern Market and Benning Road on the Blue and Silver lines. For more details see Dr. Gridlock’s traffic, transit tips for the weekend.During the exercise, emergency personnel will test remote control of the ventilation fans from Metro’s Rail Operations Control Center, and simulate evacuating passengers.The training is part of Metro’s safety upgrades after the Jan. 12 when an electrical malfunction filled a subway tunnel near the L’Enfant Plaza station with noxious fumes that sickened scores of passengers. One died of smoke inhalation.The transit agency announced an extensive cable-replacement program and the creation of a maintenance crew dedicated to keeping its tunnels clear of debris and equipment that could spark fires or create obstructions.

       "8498  Six months after he was released from prison in Iran, PEN Center USA has announced that The Post’s Jason Rezaian will receive the Freedom to Write Award at the center’s Literary Awards Festival gala in September. Willow Bay, director of the University of Southern California’s Annenberg School for Journalism, will receive the Award of Honor, given to a person or institution that has “made meaningful contributions to the world of writers and journalists.”Rezaian’s 545 days of imprisonment drew international attention to his plight and that of his wife, Yeganeh Salehi. Salehi was arrested along with Rezaian, though she was released on bail, while he remained in Evin Prison. The couple returned to the United States, along with Rezaian’s mother, in January, as part of a deal negotiated to secure the freedom of a number of Iranian Americans who had also been jailed in Iran.Though Rezaian is hardly the only journalist, American or otherwise, to be detained around the world, his case raised important issues about how the United States should respond when American citizens working as journalists are jailed overseas.Marvin Putnam, chair of PEN Center USA’s board of directors, said that he thought it would be difficult to develop “any single, clear foreign policy doctrine” that would govern the American government’s response in these cases.“That said,” he wrote in an email, “abiding by the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations as to foreign nationals detained here in the U.S. would probably be a good start, and certainly would go a long way in ensuring that Americans detained abroad receive the Convention’s same protections.”That convention, among other protections, requires that law enforcement officials inform foreign nationals they arrest that they have the right to talk to their representatives at their nation’s consulates, that they be provided the means to mount an adequate defense at trial and that they be treated by the same standards as the citizens of the country in which they’re arrested.The United States ratified the convention in 1969, but human rights advocates suggest that there are multiple occasions on which foreign nationals have been convicted of crimes in cases that did not conform to the articles of the convention. During Rezaian’s detention in Iran, The Post’s lawyers noted numerous ways in which his trial did not meet Iran’s constitutional requirements, and he was denied the opportunity to communicate with consular officials from either the United States or Switzerland; Switzerland’s consulate provides consular services to American citizens in Iran.In recognizing Bay’s work at USC Annenberg and beyond, the PEN Center USA illustrated the rising importance of digital platforms in journalism. Bay has been an anchor for “Good Morning America” and “Moneyline” and a senior strategic adviser for Huffington Post.“A [journalism] school curriculum today must focus on digital platforms,” Putnam wrote. “Technology has changed how we consume the news, and the next technological advances will change it yet again. Virtual reality and immersive journalism appear to be journalism’s next frontier.”Rezaian and Bay will receive their awards at the PEN Center USA’s Literary Awards Festival ceremony in Los Angeles on Sept. 28.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",
       "8499  A bill that would allow terminally ill adults in Maryland to take their own lives appears likely to fail in committee for the second straight year, its lead sponsor said Wednesday.With a vote expected Thursday, none of the four lawmakers whose support is needed to move the Death With Dignity Act to the full state Senate appears ready to commit to the measure, Sen. Ronald N. Young (D-Frederick) said.“I have a feeling we don’t have the votes to get it to the floor,” Young said. “I talked to several of the people who were on the fence, and got no affirmative answer from any of them.”The bill, which would allow doctors to prescribe a fatal dose of medication to patients who are expected to die within six months, has drawn strong support from advocates and families of the terminally ill but equally passionate opposition from the Roman Catholic Church, disability rights groups and others.Two members of the 11-person Judicial Proceedings Committee are co-sponsoring the legislation, while five members have said they oppose it. That means each of the remaining four lawmakers on the panel would have to vote in favor for it to advance. Two of them — Sen. Robert A. Zirkin (D-Baltimore County), the committee chair, and Sen. Victor R. Ramirez (D-Prince George’s) — expressed reservations Wednesday.“We don’t want people who are not receiving proper health care to see this as the option they have,” said Ramirez, citing testimony from bill opponents that poor people and the disabled could opt to end their lives early because options for medical treatment are too expensive or appear out of reach.Zirkin said he shared those concerns. He was troubled that no amendments have been offered to the legislation to ensure that it would not be used in an unethical way. “I have to make a decision on if it’s the right public policy,” he said.A third undecided lawmaker, Sen. Susan C. Lee (D-Montgomery), called aid in dying “a tough issue” and said “there are compelling arguments on both sides.”The fourth undecided lawmaker, Sen. C. Anthony Muse (D-Prince George’s), declined to comment.Maryland’s bill is modeled after a law passed in California last year following the highly publicized death of Brittany Maynard, a 29-year-old San Francisco Bay area woman with terminal brain cancer who moved to Oregon to commit suicide legally. A handful of other states also allow some form of assisted suicide, although a right-to-die measure failed in Colorado last week.In Maryland, a recent Goucher College poll found that 60 percent of state residents support allowing terminally ill adults to take their own lives. Young said the bill appears to have widespread support in the full Senate, and perhaps in the full House as well.But proponents of the bill said they knew they were fighting an uphill battle to push the bill out of committee, given the state’s strong African American and Catholic communities, both of which have historically been uncomfortable with assisted suicide.The Maryland Catholic Conference made defeating the bill its top priority this legislative session — joining with disability rights advocates to say the measure could open the door for mistreatment of the disabled, the elderly and minorities, and arguing that those groups already experience disparities in health-care access.“Legalizing suicide as a medical course-of-action will only serve to further erode the healthcare that vulnerable people currently receive, especially since it is much less expensive than continuing treatments,” said a statement distributed in Annapolis on Catholic Lobby Night.Lawmakers heard hours of emotional testimony on the bill during hearings in both chambers of the General Assembly. There were terminally ill patients who pleaded for the option to end their lives and caregivers who described the painful deaths of their loved ones. And there were religious leaders and disability advocates who argued that “every life” is precious and raised concerns about the potential for abuse.Proponents of Maryland’s bill have worked since last year to build momentum for the measure. They invited small groups to watch the documentary “How to Die in Oregon” (2011), about that state’s assisted-suicide law, and held “house parties” where they served refreshments and offered information about end-of-life options for the terminally ill.Several senators said they expect the committee to vote on the bill Thursday, and for it to fail to muster the six votes needed to advance. Young said the bill could just be quietly dropped from consideration.“Every demographic group supports the bill,” he said in frustration. “I consider this a personal choice. If you don’t like it, don’t do it.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",
       "8500  KIGALI, Rwanda — The man credited with transforming Rwanda from a nation stricken by genocide to a model of African development once told citizens that he would never “disrespect the constitution” by overstaying his term.So this fall, President Paul Kagame’s supporters did what they had to in order to keep him in power: They changed the constitution.Rwanda, which receives $100 million in U.S. aid every year, presents a significant test for President Obama’s push for democracy in Africa. As recently as July, Obama appealed to African leaders to step aside when their mandates expire and break with the continent’s history of strongman leaders.“Nobody should be president for life,” Obama said in the speech at the African Union headquarters in Ethiopia.Kagame, 58, is a former military commander who speaks with equal ease at Ivy League business schools and in his country’s poorest villages. He has overseen economic growth of nearly 8 percent per year and has won the friendship of philanthropists such as the singer Bono and former president Bill Clinton. But even as Kagame has garnered accolades, he has cracked down on his political opponents.Now, with Kagame increasingly likely to remain in office beyond 2017, when his tenure was due to end, Rwanda appears to have joined a slew of African countries whose leaders are getting around term limits.Within the past few months, the presidents of Burundi, Congo and the Congo Republic have either scrapped their constitutional term limits or indicated their plans to stay in office through what critics call irregularities. Human Rights Watch has dubbed it a time of “constitutional coups.” In countries such as Sudan, Uganda, Cameroon, Zimbabwe and Burkina Faso, leaders have remained in power for decades, often by jailing their opponents or rigging elections.Kagame’s supporters say Western calls for him to step down are inappropriate and misguided.“We don’t have the pretentiousness to tell France or the United States who should lead them,” Kagame told the French-language magazine Jeune Afrique in the spring. “The same principle should be applied to us.”In October, Rwanda’s lower house of parliament decided without a single dissenting vote to change the constitution to allow Kagame to run three more times. The Senate did the same last month . Depending on one’s reading of Rwandan politics, the votes were either a sign of Kagame’s overwhelming support or the fear he has instilled in would-be opponents.“Pressure from the ruling party and fear of publicly opposing Kagame have doubtlessly shaped the results of this process,” Human Rights Watch said in a recent report.Many Rwandans say that the country could unravel if Kagame leaves power without a clear successor and that term limits are not as important as national progress. It’s the same rhetoric that other undemocratic regimes have used, but Kagame perhaps has more to show for his tenure than other strongmen on the continent.The streets of this capital city are spotless. Technology start-ups are springing up in offices across the budding skyline. Tourists are streaming in to see some of the world’s last mountain gorillas, protected by a top-rate environmental agency.Although it is difficult to gauge Kagame’s popularity, he is no doubt beloved by many here. About 3.7 million people signed a petition asking him to remain in office.‘A very iron fist’Kagame grew up in exile in Uganda, one of hundreds of thousands of ethnic Tutsis who had faced discrimination in jobs and schooling in their own country, where Hutus are the majority. He joined the Tutsi-dominated Rwandan Patriotic Front, becoming an influential commander in its armed wing. After Rwanda’s 1994 genocide, in which 800,000 people were killed, most of them Tutsi, the rebels swept into the capital.Kagame went on to become vice president and minister of defense. He won the 2003 presidential election by a landslide and was reelected. His popularity in the West soared. In 2009, former British prime minister Tony Blair said he was a “visionary.” Bill Clinton called him “one of the greatest leaders of our time.”Still, when the likelihood of Kagame’s third term became apparent in June, the U.S. government issued a statement saying the country would be best served by “strong institutions, not strongmen.”It wasn’t the first time the United States has criticized Kagame. For years, U.S. officials have objected to his human rights record and his support of Congolese rebels, whom Kagame funded to pursue former Rwandan genocidaires outside the country. In a mostly symbolic move in 2012, the U.S. government cut $200,000 in military funding, citing Rwanda’s support for the guerrillas.“It has been largely an authoritarian government at the top, with Kagame going after his political enemies and adversaries with a very iron fist,” said Johnnie Carson, a former U.S. assistant secretary of state for African affairs.In 2010, one of the few opposition leaders, Victoire Ingabire Umuhoza, was arrested on charges of “inciting the masses to revolt against the government.” She was ultimately sentenced to 15 years in prison. Umuhoza had touched on one of the country’s most delicate issues when she suggested that Tutsis ought to be held responsible for killing thousands of Hutus during the 1994 conflict. The genocide is officially described here strictly as the mass killing of Tutsis by Hutus.Arrests of Kagame’s critics have continued, with the government claiming that it is defending national security.There is now only one political party that opposes the campaign for a third Kagame term, the Democratic Green Party. The group has a tiny, two-room office in a nondescript building in Kigali, with a cutout of Obama atop a cabinet. The party does not have any representatives in parliament.“When people are asked if they support Kagame, everyone says, ‘Yes, yes, yes,’?” said the party’s vice president, Karine Maombi. “It’s a joke. People are afraid to say they disagree.”‘A serious setback’For years, the international community has struggled to calibrate its relationship with Rwanda, as the country thrived, making efficient use of foreign aid, even as it was frequently accused of human rights abuses.Carson kept “analytical score cards.” In economic development, he gave Rwanda a 9 out of 10. But on domestic political issues, he gave the country a 2, in large part because of Kagame’s repression of his opponents.“I think that Kagame’s decision [to stay in office] represents a serious setback to continued democratic progression,” Carson said.But Kagame’s supporters say their nation is being unfairly grouped with countries in much different situations. In Burundi, for example, the president’s remaining in power for a third term is strongly opposed by a coalition of politicians and activists. Hundreds have been killed there in protests since April.“Unlike Burundi and Congo, we’re going through this in a very calm way,” said Jean Philbert Nsengimana, the minister of youth and information and communications technology.Although opposition candidates have won important, hotly contested elections this year in Nigeria and Tanzania, some of Africa’s most prominent leaders have held power for decades. Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe, 91, has been in power for 35 years. Sudan’s Omar Hassan al-Bashir, 71, has been president for 22 years. A $5 million prize given by the Mo Ibrahim Foundation to African leaders who govern well and then leave office at the end of their terms has been awarded only four times since it was announced eight years ago.Kagame was seen as part of a new generation of African leaders, and Western diplomats hoped he would take term limits more seriously. For a while, it appeared that he would.He said in 2010 that “it would be my failure” if no one succeeded him at the end of his second term. But now, the parliament has voted to allow him to seek one more seven-year term and two more five-year terms.The United States is among the few Western c   \n",
       "8501  They may have the oldest bromance in recorded history, and you can watch them spar with a supernatural bull in Constellation Theatre Company’s bold and colorful, if somewhat over-solemn, “Gilgamesh.”Dramatizing the celebrated ancient Middle Eastern epic, this world-premiere production conjures up — among other mythic events — the forging of an improbable friendship between the title character, a swaggering tyrant, and a mysterious figure named Enkidu. As they wander through a spirit-haunted landscape in director Allison Arkell Stockman’s staging, the pals cross paths with the vicious Bull of Heaven. Gilgamesh gives a ferocious war cry, and battle is joined.A gorgeous capering puppet with glowing eyes and shimmering silky flanks, the bull gores Enkidu (Andreu Honeycutt), the horns seeming to sink in so deeply that Gilgamesh (Joel David Santner) has to pull the animal away by the tail. Weapons flash, and eventually the spooky cow dies. (Matthew McGee is the puppet designer, and Ashley Ivey and Manu Kumasi manipulate the Bull.) Exhausted, Gilgamesh and Enkidu fall asleep, side by side, on the ground. It’s the first time we have seen the swashbuckling monarch look vulnerable.The relationship between Gilgamesh and Enkidu — a relationship that mellows and humanizes the king — injects a current of poignant feeling into this visually snazzy piece of theater, the first full staging of a published verse play by the Pulitzer Prize-winning poet Yusef Komunyakaa and dramaturg Chad Gracia. “Gilgamesh” boasts the kind of design touches that have distinguished other Constellation offerings: Kendra Rai contributes resplendent bright-hued costumes for the divine and mortal characters, and musical wizard Tom Teasley has again composed an evocative, percussion-heavy score, which he performs live onstage.But amid the pageantry, the production gains valuable emotional ballast from the poised, cogent performances by Santner and Honeycutt. The former segues artfully from imperious thuggishness to rough-hewn cordiality to suffering stoicism. And as Enkidu, who is part-man and part-animal, Honeycutt radiates a regal mystique, endearing us to the character without overexplaining him.Enkidu, curled up on the ground, is the first figure we see on Ethan Sinnott’s elegant sand-colored set, whose cuneiform-peppered panels evoke the tablets on which the Gilgamesh legend was recorded as far back as 2100 B.C. After the Woman of Red Sashes (Emma Crane Jaster) lures Enkidu away from his wild existence, he teams up with Gilgamesh to loot the Cedar Forest, patrolled by the menacing guardian Humbaba (Jim Jorgensen, seemingly dressed in bark). After subsequent skirmishes with supernatural forces — including the sultry goddess Ishtar (Nora Achrati in stunning gold drapery) — Gilgamesh ventures, Orpheus-like, into a realm beyond death, seeking a recipe for immortality.Although stocked with arresting lyricism, Komunyakaa and Gracia’s text packs a little too much tidy moral into the mystical adventure tale. Adding extra earnestness to this production are the solemn, choreographed hand gestures the actors sometimes execute when concepts such as “dream” (a fist at eye level) and “God” (splayed fingers) crop up in conversation. Presumably, the device is intended to suggest the characters’ reverent, archaic mind-set, but the effect is ponderous. Overall, “Gilgamesh” lacks the humor that helped make another Constellation spin on ancient epic, “The Ramayana,” so exhilarating.Katy Carkuff does lend sprightly flirtatiousness to the character of Siduri, the “barmaid at the brink, between worlds,” who teaches Gilgamesh about love. In turns that are equally striking but more serious, Achrati, Carkuff and Kumasi embody a council of Elders: ominous figures in robes and metallic masks.By the time he returns to his kingdom, Gilgamesh has learned enough about loss, mortality and impermanence — not to mention friendship — that he could serve as a wisdom-dispensing elder himself.Wren is a freelance writer.GilgameshPoetry by Yusef Komunyakaa, concept and dramaturgy by Chad Gracia.

       "8502  HONOLULU — The Obama administration has asked China for help in countering the North Korean cyberattacks as the United States seeks to respond to the financially costly assault on Sony Pictures.But Kim Jong Un’s regime insisted Saturday there was no proof that it was behind the hack. It called for an investigation of the case to be conducted jointly by North Korea and the U.S. government, saying that Washington “will face serious consequences” if it rejects the idea.Administration officials asked the Chinese Embassy in Washington in a meeting Thursday to block Pyongyang’s access to Internet routers and servers based in China, to expel North Korean hackers living in China and to pressure the Kim regime to end its cyberoffensive against companies in the United States, according to one official.Most of North Korea’s telecommunications traffic runs through China’s infrastructure, although some of it also is routed through Russia and North Korea’s own limited networks.The request was part of an effort by the White House to develop options for what President Obama has called a “proportional response” to the activities of which North Korea is accused.The cyberattack was apparently revenge for Sony’s planned Christmas Day release of “The Interview,” a comedy starring Seth Rogen and James Franco that involved a plot to assassinate the North Korean leader.The hackers embarrassed Sony by revealing internal documents, including e-mail messages. The cyberassailants also warned of a “bitter fate” for those attending screenings of the film, leading cinemas to cancel plans to show it. The studio ultimately decided not to even release it.“This is really provocative,” one senior administration official said of the cyberattack. The official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter, said the White House and the U.S. Embassy in Beijing are involved in the request for help from China, and that other options remain on the table in dealing with North Korea.The official emphasized that it is too early to say whether Beijing would be willing to help.“We have discussed this issue with the Chinese to share information, express our concerns about this attack, and to ask for their cooperation,” said a senior U.S. official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of diplomatic sensitivities. “In our cybersecurity discussions, both China and the United States have expressed the view that conducting destructive attacks in cyberspace is outside the norms of appropriate cyber behavior.“We have reached out to a number of our partners around the world to seek their support and cooperation,” the official said. “Several countries have already stated that this conduct is unacceptable.”The New York Times first reported on the overture to China on its Web site Saturday.The U.S. request to the Chinese puts them in a tricky spot, analysts say. On one hand, the Chinese want to cooperate with the United States on cybersecurity and cyberterrorism issues, but on the other, they do not want to alienate the North Koreans, their allies.“They have to pick between playing a greater role in keeping the North Koreans from doing malicious cyberacts or they have to annoy the Americans,” said James Lewis, a cyberpolicy expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.The Chinese pulled out of bilateral talks on cybersecurity this year after the United States indicted five People’s Liberation Army computer experts on charges of conducting economic espionage against U.S. companies through cyberspace.But while the Chinese military does not want to return to talks — it has said it will not cooperate unless the indictments are withdrawn — Communist Party and Foreign Ministry officials are seeking ways to work with the United States on some cybersecurity issues.Cyberattacks against South Korean banks last year also were routed through China, analysts said. “They have said, ‘We don’t have any knowledge of this. We’re not involved; we’re not supporting this,’ ” Lewis said. “But they also weren’t doing anything to stop this.”North Korea pushed back strongly Saturday against the U.S. allegations that it was behind the attack on Sony Pictures and said it would not engage in terrorist attacks “aimed at the innocent audience in cinemas.”“Clear evidence is needed to charge a sovereign state with a crime,” a North Korean Foreign Ministry spokesman was quoted as saying by the official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA).The U.S. government’s allegations reveal “its inveterate bitterness” toward North Korea, the spokesman said. As further proof, he cited leaked e-mails between Sony and the U.S. envoy on North Korean human rights in which the latter advised the company to go ahead with making the film.Specifically, the envoy, Robert R. King, who was not named in the KCNA report, encouraged Sony to “keep alive scenes hurting the dignity of [North Korea’s] supreme leadership,” the spokesman said.The movie contains a scene in which the Kim Jong Un character is engulfed in flames as his helicopter is blown up.The film has played into North Korea’s deepest fears that the United States intends to destroy it. The movie also came on the heels of a campaign in the United Nations to charge Kim and his officials with crimes against humanity for decades of human rights violations.“We will never pardon those undesirable elements keen on hurting the dignity” of Kim, the spokesman said.Fifield reported from Tokyo.

       "8503  Minnesota is the best state for women in America.That’s according to the Institute for Women’s Policy Research, a nonprofit that on Wednesday published the final two reports in a sprawling seven-part series exploring how women are faring in the states. The “Status of Women in the States” series, an update on a set of reports from 2004, represents an ambitious attempt to quantify gender inequality in the states—and provide fodder for the national discussion.“The way politics are structured in the U.S., if you want to make an impact it helps if you have the data,” says Ariane Hegewisch, study director at IWPR. “So the purpose was to pull the data down to the state level at least to help people concerned about addressing gender issues to make their case.”Each state and the District of Columbia received grades on seven broad topics, derived from dozens of metrics and touching on virtually all aspects of the public and private lives of women, from employment and earnings to economic opportunity to violence and safety to reproductive rights to health to political participation.[Tennessee just passed one of the nation’s longest abortion waiting periods]In the end, Hegewisch says, the report found inequities remain.“As you can still see with the results now, when you look at policy and basic socio-economic indicators, trends are different for women and men and the differences haven’t really diminished very much,” she said. Even among women, racial inequality persists, she added.In the end, Minnesota rose to the top, along with a handful of states in New England and the West Coast. The states that scored lowest were in the South, with Mississippi and Alabama tying for the title of worst state for women.The dozen best states were chosen because each appeared in the top 10 in at least one of the seven IWPR reports and none appeared below the midpoint of all states on any of the reports. The six “worst” states were chosen because each qualified in the bottom 10 of at least one report and fell below the midpoint of all states in each report.[Map: The most distinct cause of death in every state]Here’s a look at how the states stack up, in each report:1. The best state for political participation: New HampshireThough one of the last, IWPR’s report on political participation is perhaps the most important: a more engaged female electorate means better representation of women’s interests across the spectrum.After analyzing how women fared in four areas — voter registration and turnout, representation in elected office and institutional resources — IWPR concluded that women in New Hampshire are most politically engaged, earning the state a top score of a B+. New England, the Midwest and the West Coast dominate the rankings, with three states in each region placing among the top 10 overall. Seven of the worst states for women’s political participation are in the South.There’s good and bad news in the report: political representation has generally improved for women, but they have a long way to go before achieving equality.A decade ago, women accounted for fewer than 1 in 7 members of Congress. Today, they account for nearly 1 in 5. But, at the rate of progress women have seen since 1960, IWPR estimates that women won’t achieve equal representation in Congress for another 102 years.Women have yet to achieve 50 percent representation in any state legislature and while six states have female governors, only 36 of the 2,300 governors have ever been women.2. New York: the best state for women’s work-family balanceThe other report released on Wednesday is new to the series: this one tracks how well states allow for a healthy split between work and family life, largely by looking at policies that facilitate such a balance.“There has been really increased awareness of these issues, of the need to explicitly address the barriers,” Hegewisch says.In their analysis, New York rose to the top. While it had the highest score, it, California and the District of Columbia each earned Bs. Indiana, Montana and Utah scored lowest, each earning an F. That conclusion is based on four indicators: policies on paid leave, dependent and elder care and child care, as well as the share of parents in the workforce with young children at home.The report also identified big differences by race. Just 51 percent of working Hispanic women have access to paid sick days, for example, compared to 65 percent of working white or Asian women. 3. Oregon, the best state for reproductive rightsOregon scored higher than any other in terms of reproductive rights, though it, six other states and the District of Columbia earned A-minuses. Ten states earned Bs, 20 earned Cs, 9 received Ds and four — South Dakota, which ranked last, Nebraska, Kansas and Idaho — flunked on IWPR’s scorecard.The grades were based on a number of variables, including: access to, funding for and political support for abortion; sex education; and whether a state imposed any of a variety of abortion restrictions.[Where reproductive rights stand in the states, in 6 maps]Reproductive rights advanced since 2004 in some ways and retreated in others. Generally, access to infertility treatments has broadened, as has access to abortion providers. (Just barely, though: the share of women living in a county with at least one abortion provider grew in 24 states, but shrank in 22.)Meanwhile, more states added abortion waiting periods—including Tennessee this week—while the share of pro-choice public officials shrank in more states than it grew.4. The best state for women to rise above poverty? MarylandWomen fighting to move out of poverty are better off in Maryland than their their peers in any other state, according to IWPR’s analysis of poverty and economic opportunity. The report looked at the share of women who: live above the poverty line; own a business; have health insurance; and earned a bachelor’s degree, we noted when that report was released:Those four factors were chosen years ago in an effort to “pinpoint how well women are doing in this area,” says Cynthia Hess, the study’s lead author. When combined, the four factors in the report paint a composite picture of social and economic autonomy for women across the states, with women in Maryland beating Massachusetts by a nose.The variables were chosen years ago by a committee of mostly academic experts assembled by IWPR to identify representative and consistent indicators. Since 2004, the situation for women in the states has improved on two counts and backtracked on two others, we reported:The share of women with a bachelor’s degree rose 6.9 points to 29.7 percent and the share owning a business grew from 26 to 28.8 percent. At the same time, the share of women living above poverty shrank from 87.9 percent to 85.4 percent and the share of those with health insurance shrank from 82.3 percent to 81.5 percent, though the latest 2013 data omits the impact of Obamacare.5. Violence and safetyThe report on violence and safety is the only one in the series for which IWPR did not calculate a composite score, because state-level data on the relevant issues is limited.The report focuses on a slew of topics, however, including prevalence of intimate partner violence, rape and sexual assault, stalking, harassment, teen dating violence, gun violence and human trafficking.As in the other reports, the analysis of violence and safety identified large variation by ethnicity and race. More than half of Native American and multiracial women report experiencing intimate partner violence at some point in their lifetime, compared to just 15 percent of Asian women, for example. Similar trends hold for psychological aggression.The continued prevalence of such violence, along with a number of other factors, underscores the need for further research, the authors of the IWPR report argue:At a basic level, this requires improving data collection in the area of violence and abuse by ensuring that survey data are availab   \n",
       "8504  1. How is it that the FBI, which had sent out field agents to interview Tamerlan in 2011, did not recognize him in the surveillance photos and had to ask for the public’s help to identify him?This would be an important thing for the public to know, but it’s hard to see how it could help Dzhokhar’s case, so the defense may not want to pursue this question.2. Will the government tell us where the bombs were made?No residue of bomb-making was found in the Tsarnaevs’ apartment in Cambridge. Did the investigators ever figure out where the brothers made the bombs, and if anyone helped them? Prosecutor William Weinreb made no mention of this in his opening statement, so probably not.3. Who shot MIT police officer Sean Collier?The government says that eyewitnesses and a surveillance video tape place the brothers at the scene, but it is not clear which one of them had the gun and pulled the trigger. The defense says it was Tamerlan, the older brother.4. What actually happened on Laurel Street in Watertown in the very early hours of April 19, 2013?Weinreb’s description on Wednesday differed from earlier law-enforcement accounts: he made it sound like the big, chaotic gun fight in which Transit Police Officer Richard Donahue was critically injured by friendly fire occurred after Tamerlan was dead and Dzhokhar had made his get-away. Really? At least this would explain why two pipe bombs and one pressure-cooker bomb ostensibly thrown by the brothers injured no one (two more pipe bombs failed to explode) – because there were only a couple of people at the scene, and most of the police officers arrived later. But it would raise other questions. Among them: Why were police shooting after both of the brothers were gone?5. Why were the brothers driving in loops around Boston, Cambridge, and Watertown on the night of April 18?Weinreb said they were planning to go to New York in a hijacked car. But after they got the car – a Mercedes SUV – and moved their arsenal to it, they first ditched Dzhokhar’s old Honda Civic, then returned and got it, and started driving in two cars. Why?6. Will the defense manage to slip in a discussion of the 2011 triple murder in Waltham in which Tamerlan has posthumously become a suspect?It would buttress the defense case that Tamerlan was a monster and Dzhokhar had reason to fear him, but the prosecution is sure to try to exclude any mention of it.7. What will the Tsarnaevs’ imprisoned friends tell the court?Two college friends of Dzhokhar’s are awaiting sentencing or obstruction of justice, one is due to be sentenced for lying to investigators, and one more man, who was friendly with both brothers, is awaiting trial. The government has not alleged that any of them knew about the plot to bomb the Marathon, but all four are on the witness list – and there is reason to believe testifying may get them lighter sentences. They will probably be called upon to talk about Dzhokhar Tsarnaev’s radical beliefs – though the college friends’ earlier statements contain no indication that his views struck them as unusual.8. Will the government show that video that everyone has seen but no one has seen?The video ostensibly shows Dzhokhar Tsarnaev setting down a backpack with a bomb at the site of the second of the two blasts. On Monday defense attorney David Bruck said the video doesn’t exist. In his opening statement on Wednesday, Weinreb described what the jury is actually going to see: a surveillance video showing Tsarnaev arrive, carrying a backpack on one shoulder, then stop with his back to the camera and lower the shoulder – presumably out of range of the camera. The backpack at the defendant’s feet, he said, can be seen in a photograph. The question of the video, though, is largely theoretical now, since the defense is not denying that Tsarnaev set off one of the Marathon bombs9. Will Dzhokhar Tsarnaev testify?Defendants rarely do – and jurors are always instructed that defendants are under no obligation to speak – but if anyone could make a convincing case for his having been dominated by the older brother, it would be Dzhokhar himself.Related coverage:Boston Marathon trial opens with heart-rending testimony on attackOpening statements made in Boston Marathon bombing trialYou have not seen that Boston Marathon video                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",
       "8505  Your new car isn't just a car. It's a computer that relies on tens of millions of lines of code to run. But if a researcher finds a bug in all those zeros and ones that could let a criminal hacker take it over, do you have a right to know?That depends on who you ask.A bill being debated on Capitol Hill would levy hefty penalties against people who break into a car's computer system. But in testimony today, the Federal Trade Commission warned that could actually leave consumers less safe.\"We support the goal of deterring criminals from accessing vehicle data. Security researchers have, however, uncovered security vulnerabilities in connected cars by accessing such systems,\" Maneesha Mithal, associate director of the FTC’s Division of Privacy and Identity Protection, told a House subcommittee considering the bill Wednesday. \"By prohibiting such access even for research purposes, this provision would likely disincentivize such research, to the detriment of consumers’ privacy, security, and safety.\"FTC Commissioner Terrell McSweeny made a similar argument in a column published by Wired today. \"Moreover, tying the hands of white hat researchers will do nothing to prevent bad actors from finding the same vulnerabilities and exploiting them in potentially harmful ways,\" she said.But other parts of the government appear less sure about the value of independent research.In a letter sent to copyright regulators earlier this fall, the Department of Transportation said that publication of \"good faith research\" was an opportunity to promote collaboration between auto-makers and third party researchers. But the agency also said it is \"concerned that there may be circumstances in which security researchers may not fully appreciate the potential safety ramifications of their security circumvention acts and may not fully understand the logistical and practical limitations associated with potential remedial actions that may become necessary.\"Under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, people are generally prevented from getting around \"technological protection measures\" to access copyrighted material -- a provision automakers have argued should limit researchers and everyday people's ability to review the software in their cars since it is typically protected via digital means.Those restrictions, some digital advocates like the Electronic Frontier Foundation, argue have chilled research.The U.S. Copyright Office is currently considering two proposed exemptions to the law: One for vehicle owners who want to be able to tinker with or repair them and another for security research.General Motors, one of the world's largest auto makers, opposed the research exemption last year: \"Even when such efforts are undertaken by well-intentioned researchers, wider distribution of such information provides third parties, both those with ill will and those with more benign interests, access to vehicles in a way that implicates safety and security concerns. Thus, if granted, the proposed exemption will likely result in significant safety and security challenges.\"However, GM now says its working on a formal process to work with third-party researchers who find digital flaws in their vehicles.And the Transportation Department noted its fears might be allayed if disclosure was limited to regulators and affected parties or if they could ensure automakers had \"adequate time for responsive actions\" -- presumably, figuring out and distributing a fix.In practice, that's what researchers who hack cars have done. For instance, when researchers Charlie Miller and Chris Valasek discovered major problems that could allow hackers to basically take over driving of Jeep Cherokees, they shared information about it with the car's manufacturer for nearly nine months while the automaker worked on a fix and didn't go public until that fix had been released.But there have also been cases when auto-makers have tried to keep researchers quiet.In 2013, a British court put a gag order on researchers who planned to publish research on a problems with the tech some luxury car-makers used to unlock and start vehicles. Volkswagen, which brought the case against the researchers, didn't come to a settlement agreement that let the research publish their work until earlier this year.While the researchers couldn't talk, London police said more than 40 percent of car and van thefts in the city last year were carried out without the owner's keys being present -- the vast majority apparently \"the result of organised criminals using key-programming devices to create duplicate keys for vehicles.\"That's the big problem: Even if researchers don't have the freedom to investigate or disclose them, cybersecurity flaws in cars will continue to exist — and malicious hackers might be the first ones to find them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",
       "8506  WITH THE presidential election over, supporters of better U.S.-Cuban relations are calling on President Obama, who won a majority of the Cuban American vote, to seek accord with the Castro regime. They forget the case of Alan Gross, the American development contractor who this week began his fourth year in a Cuban military prison.Mr. Gross, of Potomac, was arrested on Dec. 3, 2009, after he delivered satellite telephones to members of Cuba’s tiny Jewish community. He had been hired to provide the equipment by the U.S. Agency for International Development; the aim was to help Cuban Jews connect to the Internet.In 2011, Mr. Gross was convicted of crimes against the state and sentenced to 15 years in prison. There the now-63-year-old has remained, despite health problems that include a severe loss of weight, arthritis and a growth on his shoulder. His appeals to visit his gravely ill, 90-year-old mother have been denied. Cuban president Raúl Castro has repeatedly turned down proposals to release Mr. Gross on humanitarian grounds, despite visits from envoys ranging from U.S. senators to former U.N. ambassador Bill Richardson.The Castro government says it wants to repair relations with the United States, win the lifting of what remains of the U.S. trade embargo and attract investment from American companies. So why keep Mr. Gross in prison? The answer, unfortunately, is relatively simple. Cuba wants to swap its prisoner for five Cuban spies who were arrested in Florida in 1998. The network infiltrated a U.S. Navy base and anti-Castro groups and provided information that facilitated Cuba’s 1996 shoot-down in international airspace of two planes carrying members of one of the groups. Four U.S. citizens died. The head of the network was sentenced to life in prison after a 2001 trial, while others were given lesser terms. One is now out on probation.There is no equivalence between Mr. Gross and the five prisoners, as Havana itself acknowledges. It agrees the Florida prisoners were its spies, but it has never charged Mr. Gross with espionage. But Mr. Castro sees Mr. Gross as the leverage to spring his agents, whom the state propaganda apparatus portrays as heroes. More significantly, by arranging an exchange, the regime believes it can reshape U.S.-Cuban relations on its own terms, without having to make concessions on human rights.The Gross family has appealed to Mr. Obama to send a high-level envoy to Cuba and to do what is necessary to obtain his release. That’s understandable, but the administration ought to stick to its refusal to countenance such a bargain. On the contrary, Mr. Obama should consider new steps to punish the Castro regime for the continued imprisonment of Mr. Gross, and the administration should do more to raise his case in international forums.Better relations between Cuba and the United States must be conditioned on real steps toward democratization by Havana. But until Mr. Gross is released, they ought to get worse.Read more from OpinionsThe Post’s View: Cuba should free Alan GrossJennifer Rubin: Alan Gross, Castro and ObamaLetter to the Editor: How to

       "8507  Colleges are putting the brakes on hefty price increases, but tuition and fees are still rising at a faster rate than the financial aid and family income needed to cover costs, according to two reports released Wednesday by the College Board.“Despite the moderate increases in average published prices, there were considerable increases in net tuition and fees over the past few years,” said Jennifer Ma, policy research scientist at the College Board and co-author of the reports. “These increases, combined with stagnant incomes for many families, raise concerns about ensuring educational opportunities for low- and moderate-income students.”Sticker price increases have hovered around 3 percent for the last three years, the reports showed, keeping in line with historical trends and the reversal of the soaring costs that marked the recession. But net prices for a college education are rising.Published tuition and fees for four-year public colleges and universities this fall average $9,650 for in-state students, a 2.4 percent annual increase after inflation. After taking grants, scholarships and tax credits into account, tuition and fees for local students at public universities average about $3,770. That so-called net price, though, climbs to an average $14,210 when room and board are added. Net prices continue to grow because sticker price increases have surpassed the grant aid that students receive.Meanwhile at private, nonprofit colleges, average net tuition and fees this fall was $14,220, up from an inflation-adjusted $13,340 last year. Including room and board, the net price rose from $24,980 to $26,100. Published tuition and fees at private schools crept up 3.6 percent, to $33,480 after inflation.Wages are trending up, but not enough to keep pace with the cost of college. Median family income grew at an average rate of 0.4 percent a year after inflation between 2005 and 2015, while incomes rose 0.8 percent between 1996 and 2006, according to the report.The positive news is that families are taking on less debt to cover the cost of higher education as the economy improves. Students and parents borrowed $106 billion in 2015-2016 to pay for college, down 14 percent from the peak of $124 billion in 2010-2011. Undergraduates last year borrowed 18 percent less than in 2010-2011. During the same period, graduate students took on 6 percent less debt — though over the past academic year, per-student borrowing among that group went up by $550.While sticker price increases have muted some of the gains in grant aid, there is far more money to supplement student and family resources. Grants constituted 55 percent of the funds used by undergraduates in 2015-2016, the highest level in recent years, according to the report. Students pursuing a bachelor’s degree received an average of $14,460 in financial aid last year, including $8,390 in grants, $4,720 in federal loans, $1,290 in education tax credits and $60 in federal work study.A report from Sallie Mae also showed that families paid less out of pocket for college last fall by taking advantage of more scholarships and grants to cover costs. Parents of undergraduates reported paying $1,100 less toward higher education expenses compared to the 2014-2015 academic year, according to the survey. Scholarships and grants covered 34 percent of costs, the largest percentage of any resource used to pay for school in the past five years.“The continuing downward trend in undergraduate student borrowing and the significantly higher levels of borrowing among graduate students are critical to understanding student debt problems,” said Sandy Baum, a scholar at George Washington University who co-authored the College Board reports.Graduate student loans accounts for a hefty portion of overall education debt, though far fewer people pursue advanced degrees than bachelor’s degrees. About 43 percent of graduate borrowers owed more than $40,000 in 2015, compared to 10 percent of undergraduate borrowers, according to the College Board.Still, graduate students and undergraduates who attend selective colleges have the lowest default rates on their loans. Default rates are highest among borrowers who leave school owing less than $5,000, according to the report. That finding is consistent with Federal Reserve data that shows students with small balances account for the largest share of defaults, often because they drop out of college, diminishing their prospects of finding work and earning enough to repay the debt.“The intense focus on the idea of a national student debt crisis distracts from a more important discussion about the students who actually are in crisis and keeps the struggle of these students in the shadows,” said Justin Draeger, president and chief executive of the National Association of Student Aid Administrators. “We should be targeting our resources toward finding solutions for the students who need it most.”People who earned a bachelor’s degree in 2015 left school with an average of $28,100 in debt. That number is a little lower than the $30,100 average reported by the Institute for College Access and Success, though both reports say that student debt is still rising. Debt levels vary across the country, with the highest concentration in the Northeast and Midwest, and the lowest levels in Western states.Want to read more about paying for college?

       "      <td>CARACAS, Venezuela — President Hugo Chavez, who has not been seen publicly in a month since undergoing a complex cancer surgery in Cuba, will not be back in Venezuela on Thursday to be sworn in for a fourth term, his government announced Tuesday.Vice President Nicolas Maduro said in a letter read on national television that Chavez would extend his “post-surgery recovery process beyond Jan. 10 of this year,” the date on which the constitution says the president should be inaugurated before the country’s legislature.“Because of this he will not be able to appear on that date before the National Assembly,” said the letter, which was read before lawmakers by the president of the assembly, Diosdado Cabello. The letter went on to say that the circumstances of Chavez’s absence trigger application of a constitutional article permitting him to take the oath at a later, undetermined date.The largely mysterious absence of the firebrand leader has created an increasingly tense political climate in this oil-rich country, with government opponents arguing that the constitution calls for an interim president to take over should Chavez be unable to continue in office. But the president’s supporters have argued that because Chavez was reelected in October, there is “continuity” from one term to the next, making the inauguration a mere formality.“We from the revolutionary bloc say to the president, ‘Take your time, so you can come back in good health to Venezuela,’?” Elvis Amoroso, a Chavez ally in the National Assembly, said soon after the letter from Maduro was read. “Your people are waiting for you.”With little information filtering out about Chavez’s health, however, many in Venezuela are wondering whether he will ever return. Since June 2011, Chavez has had four cancer surgeries, though Venezuelans still have not been told what kind of cancer he has, exactly where in his body the cancerous tissue was detected or what the prognosis for recovery is.Carlos Ayala, a Caracas-based constitutional lawyer, said that if the president cannot take office, then the head of the National Assembly, Cabello, would become the interim leader.Elections could be called, or Chavez could be sworn in later. But Ayala said that a medical board would have to be formed to publicly determine the state of Chavez’s health.“Everything would be cleared up if there were complete, honest information on Hugo Chavez’s health,” Ayala said. “The question is, why not follow the constitutional route?”</td>\n",

       "      <td>BOGOTA, Colombia — Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez’s revelation that Cuban doctors must remove a possible malignant tumor has thrown his drive for reelection into doubt, raising questions about whether a man famous for his stamina can withstand the rigors of a tough campaign.“In the coming weeks, unfortunately you will not see me, unfortunately I say it, and I say it with much pain,” Chavez said in a long phone interview with Venezuela’s main state television network that aired Tuesday night. “It’s the truth. I will not be able to continue at the same rhythm.”The disclosure, after months in which Chavez insisted that he was cancer-free, prompted Venezuelans to wonder Wednesday whether he would be able to sustain a high-energy campaign of the type that has characterized his rule over the past 13 years. Some political analysts even speculated that he might be forced to drop out, creating a power vacuum in a country where the president’s personality-based reign has meant there is no logical successor.“It creates a very complicated and uncertain political situation that I think helps the opposition in a really unprecedented way,” said Cynthia Arnson, director of the Latin America program at Washington’s Woodrow Wilson Center. “It’s Chavez and his personality and his charisma that have held his movement together.”The president’s delicate health returned to the headlines after Chavez said he will soon return to Cuba for surgery to remove what he called “a lesion” that could be malignant.“If it turns out to be malignant, well, that opens a new phase of radiation therapy that would be more focused,” Chavez said. “That will stop me, stop me, of course.”His comments in the phone interview, along with an earlier announcement Tuesday, come at a difficult time for the ailing 57-year-old leader. The populist firebrand, who delights in taunting the United States, is in his toughest of three reelection battles.This time, his opponent is a popular governor, Henrique Capriles, who has shown himself to be adept on the campaign trail. At just 39, Capriles presents an image of youth and vigor that stands in increasing contrast to the picture of a president hobbled by serious illness.On Feb. 12, more than 3 million voters turned out to overwhelmingly select Capriles as the opposition’s candidate for the October elections from a field of anti-Chavez foes. His emergence has flustered Chavez, who has referred to Capriles as “a low-life pig” and “the loser” and depicted him as a pawn of the United States.“The contrast between the two couldn’t be more dramatic: a young, telegenic Capriles against Chavez, who looks worse all the time,” Arnson said. “This can only help the opposition on the media front.”The president’s condition also highlights the inherent weakness of a government in which Chavez’s power is unrestricted and uncontested, said Demetrio Boersner, a political analyst in Caracas. “All the powers are concentrated in his hands, so if he’s out, then the whole system starts to weaken,” Boersner said.Boersner said that rivalries among Chavez’s associates could begin to percolate while the president’s followers question whether the movement would survive without him. “The people will be more realistic, evaluate the proposals from Capriles, consider the bad government of Chavez and the real situation in the country,” Boersner predicted.In Venezuela, the president’s health has been a state secret since Chavez announced last summer that doctors in Cuba had removed a baseball-size tumor from his pelvic region.The president later said he had recovered completely after four chemotherapy sessions that led to hair loss and caused his body to swell. But he never disclosed what kind of cancer he had or exactly where the tumor was located.On Tuesday, Chavez offered contradictory comments about his health.Earlier in the day, wearing a red hard hat and talking to state television during a factory visit, he said that there was “no metastasis” and that rumors of his ill health were being spread by his political enemies. “No one should be alarmed,” he said.But later, in the phone interview on state television, Chavez signaled that he might be out of sight for a few weeks.“I am obligated to attend to this new circumstance, to rethink my personal agenda, and take care of myself and confront what has to be confronted,” he said.Michael Pishvaian, an oncologist at Georgetown University’s Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center, said the new developments are “ominous.”“I think we can pretty safely say that this is a cancerous tumor that has recurred,” said Pishvaian, who has no direct knowledge of the case but has been following the turn of events in Venezuela. “Anytime there’s a local recurrence of a cancer, particularly after he’s had chemotherapy to kill residual cancer cells, it means that those cancer cells were resistant to the cancer therapy and are back.”Pishvaian said that after surgery, Chavez could undergo anywhere from 10 to 40 radiation therapy sessions over as many as six weeks. Those sessions can cause complications such as nausea, diarrhea and fatigue.The oncologist said that Chavez may be able to carry out some of his duties as president but that campaigning would be a challenge. “He may not be able to withstand the real rigor of a campaign,” Pishvaian said.In the phone interview, Chavez tried to sound upbeat while reflecting on his hopes for the future.“I ask for life,” he said, speaking to his followers. “I want to live with you and fight with you until the last moment of this life that God gave me.”More world news coverage:- Several killed in Koran-burning protests- IAEA concedes failure on Iran mission- Two Western journalists killed in Syria- Read more headlines from around the world</td>\n",

       "      <td>CARACAS, Venezuela — Olga Fonseca was sent to Kenya on a mission she knew was difficult and possibly even dangerous. She was so worried about the assignment, according to her brother, that she had asked her relatives to go with her. None of them went.The career diplomat had been asked to take charge of the Venezuelan Embassy and fire all the remaining staff, he said. But less than two weeks later, on July 27, she was found dead in the ambassador’s residence in one of Nairobi’s ritziest neighborhoods. Her body was discovered in bed, underneath a blue sheet, and her hands were bound behind her back with sisal rope. Police said she had been strangled.The killing shocked Venezuelans, especially after Kenyan police charged the embassy’s first secretary with the death. Kenyan authorities say they suspect that Fonseca was the victim of a leadership battle at the embassy, but more than a month later, clear answers about the crime remain elusive. Neither the Venezuelan government nor the Kenyan police have explained how Fonseca ended up dead just days after arriving.Meanwhile, her killing has become a political issue back at home, as Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez faces the toughest reelection battle of his political life. His opponents have seized on the case to argue that Venezuela’s diplomatic corps is in shambles.Francisco Fonseca, an older brother of the dead diplomat, said he remembers clearly his last conversation with her at a going-away party a few days before she left for Kenya in mid-July.“She told me she was worried because what they had told her to do was go to Kenya to get rid of the entire staff and organize the embassy again with new staff,” he said. The experienced 57-year-old diplomat, who had last been director for Africa in the Foreign Ministry, was replacing Ambassador Gerardo Carrillo Silva, who had abruptly been relieved of his post.Fonseca’s brother said she didn’t explain why she was instructed to fire employees at the embassy. But in retrospect, he said, her concerns may have been linked to news reports that some Kenyan employees had accused Carrillo of sexual harassment.Carrillo has denied those accusations, telling the Venezuelan newspaper Ultimas Noticias that the Foreign Ministry called him home in May and suspended him from his post without explanation.The spotlight has now focused on Dwight Sagaray, the first secretary charged with Fonseca’s killing.Sagaray, a 35-year-old lawyer, has sat in a Nairobi jail ever since he was arrested, just hours after an embassy worker discovered Fonseca’s body. There was a little blood in the sitting room downstairs, which police said suggested that there might have been a scuffle. Also charged with murder is Mohamed Ahmed Mohamed Hassan, a doctor and friend of Sagaray’s who Kenyan prosecutors say is in hiding.Stephen Biko Ligunya, who is Sagaray’s attorney, said his client was falsely accused. He said that the prosecution is describing the motive behind the killing as a power struggle between Fonseca and Sagaray. — Associated Press</td>\n",

       "      <td>Some Venezuelans cannot get enough of Nelson Bocaranda, a mild-mannered radio reporter and gossip columnist who has been dishing up inside information on President Hugo Chavez’s cancer.While the government has said little about the president’s ordeal, Bocaranda’s dribs and drabs, via Twitter, a Web site and a newspaper column, have revealed major developments. That has infuriated officials who say the author of the “Murmurs” column in El Universal is destabilizing the country ahead of an October presidential election that Chavez has vowed to win despite his illness.“Despicable rat,” Mario Silva, the caustic host of “The Razor” on state television, said of Bocaranda.“Perhaps someone pays him to write his lies?” asked Diosdado Cabello, the president of the National Assembly.Andres Izarra, the government’s information minister, called Bocaranda’s revelations part of a “psychological war, a war of rumors,” and said that Chavez has dealt with the situation “with total transparency.”And to a degree, the president has, telling the nation he had a tumor removed in June in Cuba, followed by chemotherapy. Chavez also announced he had been cured of cancer — until a recurrence sent him back to Cuba for a third surgery that took place on Feb. 26.On Friday, 19 days later, Chavez returned to Venezuela, sounding optimistic about a future that includes a challenging reelection campaign against a young and spirited opposition candidate, Henrique Capriles.“I am going to live, we are going to live, we are going to continue to overcome,” said Chavez, 57, in a half-hour address televised nationwide.Bocaranda, though, said the government has revealed little, noting that Chavez still has not said what kind of tumor he had or where it was located. He said the president’s health is fair game, explaining that Chavez is an omnipresent figure who controls all Venezuelan institutions.“This is a man who is the whole government, the man who has the whole congress, the whole supreme court, everything, all the powers,” Bocaranda, 66, who wears heavy glasses and slicks his gray hair back, said in an interview after his nightly radio show. “I think that is why his health is most important for us.”With only Chavez himself releasing information about his cancer, the country has become rife with rumors as Venezuelans argue over whether the president will be able to carry out a grueling campaign schedule.“I think this is classic,” said Luis Vicente Leon, a pollster and political analyst. “When a society faces a vacuum of information over an issue that is relevant, then it fills the vacuum with rumors.”In one of the president’s strongholds — a vast neighborhood of towering apartment blocks called 23 of January for the date in 1958 when Venezuela’s last dictator was ousted — residents on a recent day drank beer at an open-air restaurant and argued over how the president should handle his privacy vs. the public’s need to know.“The president’s health worries everyone and more so because he’s the top leader, the No. 1 authority,” said Felix Garcia, a former sportswriter who, like many here, is on a state payroll. “Still, I think, there is a privacy issue, privacy for anyone, even Chavez.”Celia Fernandez, relaxing with Garcia, quickly chimed in: “But he is a public figure, the primary leader, and the people he represents need more information.”And to get some of that information, some say, they closely read Bocaranda.In June, he was the first to reveal that Chavez had cancer, which the president confirmed days later in a dramatic televised speech. Then, in the early morning hours of Feb. 20, Bocaranda issued a series of tweets reporting a recurrence of cancer, which Chavez confirmed the next day.That last scoop generated 80,000 more followers to @NelsonBocaranda, where he now has nearly 570,000 readers.Bocaranda said he uses five phones and 10 SIM cards, as well as his BlackBerry, e-mail and old-fashioned shoe-leather reporting, to collect information from sources. He has said his sources are in Cuba and suggested some are close to the president.Walking into a restaurant on a recent weekend night, Bocaranda was mobbed by diners who wanted to shake his hand and have their pictures taken with him.“He’s like a rock star,” said Mariela Celis, who co-hosts “The Happy Traffic Jam” on Union Radio with Bocaranda. “He has to say hello to people at 10 tables and the waiters and the head waiter. And everyone then asks, ‘Hey what do you know? How’s Chavez? How’s this going to turn out?’ ”Indeed, moments after shaking Bocaranda’s hand, one loyal reader, Manases Capriles, 42, a lawyer, said, “He is the minister of information, working in the shadows. He is the official voice of Venezuela.”His friend Fidel Montanez, 41, also a lawyer, said that “while the government works at disinformation, it is through Nelson Bocaranda that you get to know the truth.”With Venezuela’s government facing a raft of crises, from an oil spill that polluted drinking water to divisions within Chavez’s Socialist Party, the president on the surface appears to be facing a taxing year.That is not lost on his challenger in the upcoming election, Henrique Capriles, who on Thursday appeared to defy Chavez to keep up with him. “Where will I take advantage? What is my strength? Running around the country,” said Capriles, 39, who plays up his hobbies of basketball and long-distance running.Chavez, meanwhile, said in a Saturday speech that he will undergo radiation therapy, which may slow his normally feverish pace on the campaign trail.Even so, the president remains formidable, controlling a large media apparatus and using his considerable charm to appeal to voters on television, said Leon, the analyst. “It is not the same,” Leon said, “but the truth is that for Chavez, it is not as necessary to tour the country as it is for Capriles.”Upon his return to Caracas, Chavez declared his operation a success and said he came home with an “indomitable strength, a celestial strength, a strength that is more than human.”But recounting a conversation with Fidel Castro, whom he considers a father figure, Chavez said he had to be focused on his recuperation.“He told me, ‘Chavez, I know you. Tell your people that you have to be disciplined. They will understand, so no one thinks this has passed,’ ” Chavez said. “We are overcoming, but we need to be rigorously disciplined.”More headlines from around the world:- Two blasts hit security targets in Syrian capital- Sadr’s militia hands over U.S. citizen- In Israel, prospect of war with Iran raises questions about defense- Read more headlines from around the world</td>\n",

       "      <td>CARACAS, Venezuela — It’s become a well-worn routine here: A news flash about President Hugo Chavez’s battle with cancer is issued, invariably delivered with great fanfare but scant details.But what is increasingly troubling Venezuelans is not just the lack of candor that envelops the president’s condition, but that the news just as often comes from Cuba as it does from government ministries in Caracas. To protest what they call Cuban meddling, university students have chained themselves together in front of the Cuban embassy, and a growing chorus of opposition leaders charge that the Cuban government is calling the shots when it comes to Chavez’s health care.Amid rising tensions over the state’s secrecy, the government issued pictures of Chavez last week, the first time he had been seen publicly in 67 days. In the photos, Chavez is smiling and holding up a copy of Cuba’s state newspaper, Granma, from a hospital bed in Cuba.And just a few days before, revolutionary icon Fidel Castro — whom Chavez has called a father figure and a saint — offered more details than Venezuelan officials had by reporting that he received updates on the Venezuelan leader’s health “every day” and that Cuba’s most famous patient “is recovering.”“Ironically, Fidel Castro knows more about our president than the Venezuelans do,” quipped Federica Romer, 19, a university student who has been among those protesting outside the embassy.For some here, it is a sign that the small, poor island nation has an outsized role in Venezuelan affairs. It’s a role that seems to have grown since June 2011, when Chavez, speaking on national television from Havana, first revealed that he had undergone surgery on the island to remove a tumor.“I have to tell you that my indignation grows every day,” said Adicea Castillo, 75, an economist who helped topple Venezuela’s last dictatorship in 1958 and said she was once supportive of Fidel Castro. “It’s outrageous to see a government and a president so beholden in this way to Cuba.”Drawing closer togetherCuba’s influence on Venezuela is well known here. Over Chavez’s 14 years in power, Cuba has sent sports trainers and doctors to Venezuela’s poor barrios and provided intelligence agents to this country’s military. Venezuela has reciprocated with 100,000 barrels of oil a day at cut-rate prices, an economic lifeline that analysts say has helped keep the Castro regime afloat.Chavez’s government has also worked tirelessly for Cuba to be accepted by other Latin American countries, an effort that paid off last month when President Raul Castro assumed the presidency of a 14-month-old regional bloc called the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States.But Chavez’s cancer has drawn the two countries even closer, with the president spending more and more time in Havana as doctors grapple with a tumor that appears to have fended off four surgeries, chemotherapy and radiation treatments.Indeed, Chavez was last seen in Venezuela on Dec. 10, when he boarded an early-morning flight to Havana. He missed his Jan. 10 swearing-in for a fourth term and, until photographs of him were released Friday, no one aside from a small cabal of aides and family members knew for sure whether he was even alive.What Venezuelans do know is that the country’s top leaders have taken to flying constantly to Cuba to meet with Chavez. Those associates say Chavez has provided them with detailed instructions on running the state.But critics say that Chavez has been in no condition to govern and that Cuba’s government is helping plot Venezuela’s course.“What’s happening in Venezuela has no precedent in our history,” said Maria Corina Machado, an outspoken anti-Chavez lawmaker. “For the first time in 200 years of republican history, the decisions regarding the destiny of our country are being taken abroad.”Such accusations have angered Venezuelan officials, who call the relationship with Cuba “a brotherhood” based on mutual respect.But the government’s annoyance at the criticism has done little to curb growing resentment among some Venezuelans.‘A great uncertainty’In recent days, university students have chained themselves outside the Cuban embassy, which has drawn other protesters angry about Chavez’s long sojourn in Havana. With a phalanx of National Guard troops protecting the embassy, the students have been sleeping on cushions and blankets in the middle of the street.They say they won’t leave until they have clear answers about the president’s health.For the protesters, the photographs issued by Chavez’s aides proved nothing. They noted that the government still has not said what kind of cancer Chavez has nor revealed details about his prognosis or whether he will even return to Caracas.“We Venezuelans are living a great uncertainty, really, because we don’t know the truth,” said Gustavo Frias, 23, who spent the weekend at the embassy with other students. “We don’t know how the president is, if he’s fine, if he’s alive, if he’s dead. The truth is what we want to know.”Emilia Diaz-Struck contributed to this report.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Displaying youthful vigor, Henrique Capriles sprang from his campaign van in the center of this farm-belt town on a recent day, leading his followers on a sprint along narrow streets.Teenage girls mobbed him, mothers wanted to talk about better schools, and unemployed workers asked about jobs. And some even told him: You look like Hugo Chavez did in 1998, the way you energize your followers.It is not a comparison the presidential hopeful easily casts aside as Venezuela’s campaign season kicks into gear. When Chavez came on the political scene as a trim, 44-year-old former army paratrooper, his fresh face and revolutionary ideas made him a viable alternative to the established order. He won big.Now Capriles, who has a wiry athletic build and is 39, is offering a similar break — not only from the aging opposition politicians who came from the two-party system Chavez replaced but also from the president himself.“I think the government is tired,” Capriles said in an interview in the midst of his campaign here. “It’s a government that talks and talks, promises and promises, but you cannot live on that. It is 14 years in power. We have to close the cycle.”Capriles faces an uphill battle, but polls released late last year showed him closer to the president than any other politician who has challenged Chavez. On Sunday, Capriles is expected to emerge from a field of five opposition leaders in a first-ever primary designed to choose one strong candidate who could end Chavez’s long rule in October’s presidential election, according to the Caracas-based pollster Datanalisis.The very fact that a primary is taking place — one in which various parties are represented — demonstrates how a once-fractured opposition has united, political analysts say. Aside from Capriles, two other candidates are younger than 45 and come with new ideas that make it difficult for Chavez to characterize them as part of the old, corrupt order that he smashed in his rise to power.“There was once no unity. There were centrifugal forces but no structure,” said Ramon Guillermo Aveledo, the head of the United Democratic Platform, an anti-Chavez coalition that is organizing the primary. “We have advanced strongly and are now more coherent and more consistent, with a clearer message than before.”Chavez’s recuperationThe primary arrives after a year in which Chavez underwent delicate surgery in Cuba to remove a cancerous tumor. Four chemotherapy sessions followed, leaving him temporarily bald. Chavez says he has recovered, though he has not provided a detailed medical prognosis or disclosed what kind of tumor he had.But since October, his activities have picked up, first with phone calls to state television and later with appearances. He has hosted summits of Latin American leaders, returned to his role as host and central guest of his Sunday television show and joshed around with visitors such as Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.“The management of his health problems has been brilliant,” said Carlos Romero, a political scientist here. “Some people spoke of the possibility of a transition because President Chavez only had a few remaining days left. But six or seven months have passed, and Chavez is not only recuperating his health but also he is recuperating his leadership.”Luis Vicente Leon of Datanalisis said Chavez’s approval rating rose from just above 50 percent in the middle of last year to 56 percent in December and has since inched up more. At the same time, Leon said, the government’s oil-fueled spending machine is in high gear as officials try to build homes for the homeless and start up programs to provide loans for everything from refrigerators to cars.Javier Corrales, co-author of a recent book on Chavez, “Dragon in the Tropics,” said that central to the government’s message is that Chavez is indispensable as leader of the so-called Bolivarian revolution, a man so vital that it would mean chaos if he were to be replaced. Chavez has frequently said he hopes to rule until 2031.Chavez has also worked to solidify his base by promoting hard-line associates — some of whom participated with him in the failed 1992 coup that brought him recognition — to top government posts. They include Gen. Henry Rangel Silva as defense minister, even though U.S. officials accuse him of assisting Colombia’s drug-trafficking guerrillas.Their arrival heralds what will probably be an increasingly bruising campaign season.“They are wolves in sheep’s clothing,” Diosdado Cabello, recently named to head the National Assembly, said in a televised interview Sunday in talking about the president’s foes. “Their proposals are against the people.”‘Vote for the best leader’In a five-hour event he hosted last week in a theater in a poor Caracas neighborhood, Chavez reminded his followers that past leaders provided “hunger, misery, lead and death.”“We’ll never go back. The retrogrades can forget it!” Chavez said, using a new put-down for his foes. “That’s a new way of calling the bourgeoisie, the ones who want to go back to the past. I call them retrogrades, and they will be called retrogrades forever.”Still, the president has yet to face an electoral challenge quite like the one being mounted by Capriles, a former mayor and now the popular governor of Miranda state.Polls show that Venezuelans are increasingly dissatisfied with the government’s handling of rampant crime, rising prices, substandard housing and other issues.Such discontent helped opponents sweep into Congress in 2010 elections and also turn back a referendum that would have handed Chavez more powers. Those same concerns over Venezuela’s deep problems are giving ammunition to Capriles, who avoids direct criticism of Chavez and characterizes himself as a left-of-center progressive similar to former Brazilian leader Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva.“You have to vote for the best leader, the one who will provide the best opportunity for changing the country,” Capriles said as he stopped for a moment during his campaign swing in Acarigua. Reporters thrust microphones in his direction, and Carmen Lucena, a 58-year-old hairdresser, tried to push through the crowd to hear him.She said that she was tired of the political polarization, which she blamed on Chavez, and that her children were having problems finding work.“Capriles represents a change for this country,” she said. “I have always admired Capriles, for his work and because he is young and well prepared.”More world news coverage:- Architect of Egypt’s NGO crackdown is Mubarak holdover- Russia says Assad wants dialogue- Syria resumes shelling of Homs- Read more headlines from around the world</td>\n",

       "      <td>It was remarkable how many non-Cubans knew the Cuban national anthem well enough to sing along Monday as the flag was raised over the newly re-established embassy on 16th Street NW. Then they joined in the delirious shouts of “Viva Cuba!”But not so surprising really, when you grasp that for many of the several hundred packed into the diplomatic mansion and filling the sidewalk outside, seeing the red, white and blue banner with the single star flapping again in Washington was the culmination of a life’s work and a life’s wait.“It’s an amazing moment,” said Phyllis Bennis, a fellow with the progressive think tank, Institute for Policy Studies. “In the decades-long effort to normalize relations with Cuba, to stop the U.S. attacks and hostility toward Cuba, we have not had so many victories. Suddenly we have a victory. The flag going up — that’s huge.”[Mojitos on the house at the Cuban Embassy’s first party]So it was a victory party then, that mojito-soaked affair that followed the triumphant and somewhat defiant address by Cuba’s foreign minister, Bruno Rodríguez. And yet, for many people drinking before noon, the conversations were rather earnest and sober. That is the nature of these quixotic policy idealists who never gave up. They are so used to the patronizing impatience of the old Cold War realists, not to mention the outright hostility of the Cuba-haters, that their thoughts naturally channel into a hard-shell patois of heavily footnoted emotion.“For those of us who were committed to the values and the aspirations of the Cuban revolution, the flag, as Fidel said in April 1959 when he was in this building, was a reflection of Operation Truth,” said James Early, a Cuba specialist who recently retired from the Smithsonian. Raising that flag again “is a recognition of Cuba’s right to sovereignty and self-determination…and to more freely deal with its own internal self-criticism, its failures, its errors, in the context of its extraordinary achievements.”Peter Kornbluh, who runs the Cuba Documentation Project at the National Security Archive, was carrying around a book he co-authored, “Back Channel to Cuba,” about the twisted secret history of outreach between the nations.“I wouldn’t miss this for the world,” he said. “It’s a flag flying in the winds of change.”[Full diplomatic ties after five decades]Not that there wasn’t plenty unfiltered emotion. Standing near Bennis was Valerie Landau, daughter of the late documentary filmmaker and activist Saul Landau. The elder Landau spent the better part of his life working toward this moment, before cancer cut his work short in the middle of another documentary on Cuba, in 2013. Traveling with Castro through Cuba in the late 1960s, he memorably filmed the revolutionary leader shedding his uniform and playing baseball, shirtless, with peasants. At the embassy Monday, more than one veteran of the struggle for Cuban engagement choked up at the absence of Landau and his camera at such a milestone.“We’re continuing his work in our own way,” said Valerie Landau, who leads tours to Cuba and also works with the Cuban health ministry on education programs. “I think this is a real crossroads, and there’s going to be a lot of change in Cuba. Some of it at their own speed and choice, and some of it as a result of an avalanche of interest on the part of Americans who are hungry to know and see Cuba.”The limestone and marble mansion opened as the Cuban Embassy in 1919 and quickly established itself as a delightful society party venue. Diplomatic relations were broken in 1961, two years after Castro took power. The mansion was shuttered. It re-opened in 1977 as the Cuban Interests Section, parallel with a U.S. Interests Section in Havana. The move to have full-fledged embassies again came after President Obama and President Raúl Castro resolved in December to normalize relations.As they return to their place in Washington’s embassy society, the Cubans will have to learn from the Venezuelans or the British about efficient crowd management. Hundreds were stuck on the sidewalk in a slow-moving line under a Havana-harsh sun without the grace of a breeze from the Malecón. They amused themselves with inside jokes about life in Cuba.“This is Cuban style: always a long line!” one called out in Spanish. Everyone laughed.Code Pink provided entertainment with chants and signs that said, “Salsa sí! Embargo no!”The trade embargo and travel restrictions remain in effect unless Congress votes for a change.“I didn’t know if I’d live to see this day,” said Code Pink organizer Medea Benjamin, who lived in Cuba from 1979 to 1983.She said she was deported for being so outspoken — hence her “love-hate relationship” with Cuba. Lately it’s been more love. She leads large tours of activists to the island and is planning an upcoming teach-in in the city of Guantanamo against continued U.S. control of the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base.“We could learn so much from each other,” Benjamin said.Inside the embassy, actor Danny Glover drifted from room to room. A regular visitor, his ties to Cuba run so deep than when the remaining Cuban Five prisoners were released by the United States in December, one of the first phone calls made by their informal leader Gerardo Hernandez as a free man was to Glover.“I’m excited,” Glover said. “This is the beginning of another narrative….What’s happened in the last 54 years is an insult to our intelligence as human beings and citizens.”Glover found his way over to celebrated Cuban folk singer Silvio Rodríguez, who was one of the bold-faced names from the island included in the Cuban delegation.“There was a time when this confrontation [between the two nations] was so strong that many of us came to think that there was no remedy,” Rodríguez said in Spanish after posing for pictures with Glover and Benjamin. “One of the most curious things I realize today is that yes, there is a remedy. And that now we can begin to work in that direction.”The reception was liberally sprinkled with Democratic senators and members of Congress — bipartisan exception: Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) — some of whom have been toiling at reaching out to Cuba for as long and as hard as the activists and the policy wonks.“I’ve spent 25 years in Congress trying to change this policy,” said Rep. José Serrano (D-N.Y.), who hosted Castro in the Bronx in 1995, and was criticized for it by some. “We gave him a party at a place called Jimmy’s Bronx Café. People who went to that event are texting me now saying, ‘Don’t you feel vindicated?'”Soon it was time for everyone to head back into the blazing sun and the certain knowledge that some of the hardest work is yet to be done.The day before he died in 1895 in the war for independence against Spain, Cuban poet and nationalist José Martí wrote a letter to a friend. He said that he was risking his life for Cuban independence in order to prevent the United States from dominating the region.The wariness of Martí, as well as the poet’s admiration for the United States, were both cited by Rodríguez, the foreign minister, in his remarks at the embassy. You could look at the mojito party as, most of all, a celebration of the original vision of Martí, who imagined the nation where he was born and the one where he sojourned in exile co-existing as equals diplomatically, if not in military and economic might. Accepting the other’s flag, could be a starting point.“There was a war for 56 years, and the war is over,” said Philip J. Brenner, a professor in the School of International Service at American University. “Both Americans and Cubans won….Now the two countries can deal with their disagreements with mutual respect.”</td>\n",

       "      <td>“THIS REVOLUTION doesn’t just depend on one person,” Hugo Chavez told Venezuelans in a television address Saturday night. Sadly for Mr. Chavez, that claim may soon be tested. The 58-year-old caudillo, who has been suffering since early last year from an undisclosed form of cancer, has returned to Cuba for more surgery — and is sick enough to have named a successor in the event he is unable to remain in office.Mr. Chavez’s incapacitation could tip Venezuela, one of the largest U.S. oil suppliers, toward a prolonged period of turmoil or even violence. If so, it will be due not so much to his illness but to the breathtaking irresponsibility with which he has responded to it. Mr. Chavez did not tell Venezuelans he was ill until after he had already undergone at least one cancer surgery in Cuba; to this day he has not said what type of cancer he has or what his prognosis is. Twice he has declared himself fully cured, most recently when he launched this year a campaign for a new six-year term as president. Almost immediately after his victory in the Oct. 7 vote, Mr. Chavez disappeared from view — a strong indication that he deceived the millions of voters who supported him.Mr. Chavez is now saying that his longtime foreign minister, Nicolas Maduro, should succeed him. But he cannot appoint him to office: Venezuela’s constitution says that if the president dies or is forced to leave office, a new election for president must be held within 30 days. There is no guarantee that Mr. Chavez’s populist movement can hold together after his death or that Mr. Maduro could defeat a challenger from the Venezuelan opposition. Polls have consistently shown that the opposition candidate in the October election, Henrique Capriles Radonski, could defeat any government nominee except Mr. Chavez.Mr. Chavez has meanwhile ensured that whoever succeeds him will inherit a daunting mess. To win the election, the government spent wildly, running up a budget deficit of 20 percent of gross domestic product. The next president consequently will be forced to devalue the currency, giving a boost to inflation that is already in double digits and worsening already-severe shortages of consumer goods. That’s not to mention the tidal wave of violence that has overtaken the country: Venezuela’s murder rate is now one of the highest in the world.In 14 years in power, Mr. Chavez has thoroughly wrecked what was once Latin America’s richest country and one of its most enduring democracies. Now, thanks to his dishonesty about his health, he could create a vacuum in which Venezuelans have 30 days to decide on a leader to inherit the catastrophe he created.Read more on this issue:The Post’s View: Chavez’s days are numberedThe Post’s View: Venezuela on fireThe Post’s View: Venezuela has a new chance</td>\n",

       "      <td>On Feb. 12, Henrique Capriles Radonski, a 39-year-old Venezuelan state governor, won a primary election to become the opposition’s candidate against Hugo Chavez in October’s presidential election. He won 1.8 million of an astonishing 3 million votes — double the turnout predicted by most analysts.The next day, Capriles, a devout Catholic, was greeted by a commentary on the government-run Web site of Venezuelan National Radio titled “The Enemy Is Zionism.” Capriles, it explained, is the descendant of Jews. (In fact, his grandmother was a Holocaust survivor who emigrated from Poland to Venezuela.)“In order to understand the interests embodied” by Capriles, the commentary declared, “it’s important to know what is Zionism, the Israeli ideology that he sneakily represents. .?.?. It is, without doubt, an ideology of terror, of the most putrefied sentiments of humanity; its supposedly patriotic impetus is based in greed.” And so on.“Zionism,” it concludes, “is owner of the majority of the financial institutions of the planet, controls almost 80 percent of the world economy and virtually all of the communications industry, in addition to maintaining decision-making positions within the U.S. Department of State and European powers.”Thus began the latest — and what will surely be the ugliest — political campaign by Chavez, a ruler who has served as a friend in need to Moammar Gaddafi, Bashar al-Assad and Mahmoud Ahmadinejad — and who now is facing his own homegrown democratic uprising. But Venezuela’s spring differs from those of Libya, Syria or Iran: Instead of pouring into the streets, Venezuelans — fed up with the chaos and violence of Chavez’s 13 years in power — are marching to the polls and trying to restore the country’s crippled and compromised institutions.The opposition Capriles now heads has learned lessons that might benefit some of the revolutionaries of the Middle East. It tried and failed to oust Chavez with mass demonstrations and strikes; it foolishly boycotted elections it believed would be unfair; it indulged in endless internal quarrels. The result was the entrenchment of a strongman who has thoroughly wrecked what was once Latin America’s richest country and who now presides over the highest inflation and murder rates in the Western Hemisphere, shortages of basic goods and power, and a drug-trafficking industry whose kingpins include the defense minister.The opposition could have turned savage; instead it grew civil. Capriles, lanky and somewhat wonky, has insisted on pursuing power peacefully and by electoral means, even when the playing field is tilted. In 2004 Chavez jailed him on bogus charges; he won acquittal and in 2008 stunned Chavez’s hand-picked candidate for governor in Miranda, the populous state that surrounds Caracas. Now some pollsters are giving him even-money odds of beating Chavez himself, if the votes are counted fairly. His campaign has focused not on the caudillo but on the country — how he would begin to piece the economy and democratic institutions back together, while preserving social programs for the poor. His model, he says, is Brazil’s social democratic hero, former president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva.Chavez has responded by importing the rhetoric of the Holocaust-denying Ahmadinejad, whom he recently welcomed to Caracas. He has tried to seize the ballot papers from the opposition primary, probably in order to identify and punish those who participated; such an operation targeted signers of a 2004 recall petition.Meanwhile he is pouring borrowed money into the economy in a frantic effort to buy back support. The government budget calls for a 46 percent increase in spending this year. The state oil company borrowed $17.5 billion last year and is expected to sell another $12 billion to $15 billion in bonds. There is also a $30 billion credit line from China, to be paid back with discounted oil sometime in the future.For Chavez, the future beyond October may not matter much. Operated on for cancer in Cuba last June, he has never disclosed the details of his illness; more than one foreign report suggests that he suffers from an incurable malignancy. Photos of his puffy face are in keeping with reports from opposition sources that he is relying on massive steroid injections to keep himself upright between now and October.A lot of Venezuelans worry that one way or another, the country is headed for an implosion. A Capriles win could be contested by pro-Chavez generals; if Chavez wins and dies, a vacuum will open. Either way the economy will likely crash, once the pre-election spending binge ends.That’s why the very orderliness and moderation of Capriles and the opposition coalition are so striking. Theirs is not so much an ideological or partisan crusade as a desperate effort to restore a semblance of political and social order to a country that is unraveling — a grasp at the modernity they glimpse in Brazil and Chile. Are they too late? The next seven months will tell. diehlj@washpost.com Read more about Venezuela from PostOpinions:Post’s View: Venezuela’s new chanceJackson Diehl: Obama’s policy on Venezuela leaves Chavez’s victims paying price</td>\n",

       "      <td>With his government increasingly isolated by sanctions and facing the U.S. Navy close to home, Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad flew Sunday to Venezuela to meet with a like-minded leader who shares his goal of challenging the United States, President Hugo Chavez.The arrival of Ahmadinejad in the Venezuelan capital, to be followed by a swing this week through Nicaragua, Cuba and Ecuador, allows Iran to show that it still has friends and economic partners despite sanctions designed to cripple its nuclear program. Back home, Iran’s currency, the rial, has steadily lost ground, buffeting importers, while tensions have risen over the country’s threats to close the Strait of Hormuz, through which 20 percent of the world’s crude oil supply passes.To be sure, in Chavez, Ahmadinejad has an enthusiastic supporter who has vocally backed Iran’s nuclear program, taken sides with Tehran against Israel and adhered to the Iranian government’s line that domestic critics of its policies are little more than CIA stooges.“What the empire does is make you laugh in its desperation to do something they will not be able to do: dominate the world,” Chavez said Sunday as he resumed his weekly television show, “Hello, Mr. President,” which had been suspended since June as he recovered from surgery to remove a cancerous tumor.“We are free,” said Chavez, who told viewers that he would meet with Ahmadinejad on Monday. “The people of Latin America will never again kneel, dominated by the imperial Yankee.”Before departing Tehran on Sunday morning, Ahmadinejad told the semiofficial Fars News Agency that strong ties with Latin America were vital toward “battling the hegemonic systems” of the United States and its European allies.“We will discuss the hegemonic system’s efforts to interfere in countries and establish its military presence there,” he told Fars, using language similar to that employed by Chavez to appeal to his most radicalized followers. Other Iranian officials also have cast the trip as a sign that sanctions had failed.Iran has not been isolated, Esmail Kowsari, a former general who serves on parliament’s national security and foreign policy committee, told Fars on Sunday. He added that “one of the signs is the expansion of trade between Iran and other countries, particularly the Latin American ones.”But Ecuador, Nicaragua and Cuba have small economies with little to offer Tehran as it searches for a tangible way to ease the impact of American sanctions. And Venezuela imports mainly from its neighbors while exporting oil, like Iran, a fellow member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries .Ahmadinejad is not visiting Brazil, the world’s sixth-largest economy, nor the bigger countries in the region, which have diverse economies but also pragmatic diplomatic and economic ties with the United States.“There are a handful of countries, including a small number of countries in Latin America, that have been willing to establish warm relations with the Iranian government because of shared objectives,” said Cynthia Arnson, director of the Latin America program at the Washington-based Woodrow Wilson Center, which has closely followed Iran’s diplomatic initiatives in the region. “Most of that agenda is driven by antipathy toward the United States and a desire to confront U.S. power.”The Obama administration has recently voiced concern about Iran’s efforts to increase its influence in the region.In a rare interview with a Venezuelan newspaper, El Universal, President Obama said in December: “It is up to the Venezuelan people to determine what they gain from a relationship with a country that violates universal human rights.”“Here in the Americas,” he added, “we take Iranian activities, including in Venezuela, very seriously and we will continue to monitor them.”Still, high-ranking administration officials have said that although Iran has made an effort to play a bigger role in the region, it has fallen short. Close diplomatic ties remain limited to Chavez, Cuba’s communist government and countries with little economic clout. Pledges by a cash-strapped Iran to build a range of big-ticket projects in the region, including factories, ports, refineries and dams, have failed to materialize.“We have no evidence that Iran’s efforts to enhance outreach to Latin America is gaining momentum,” a high-ranking Obama administration official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss the matter freely, said in a phone interview. “The record is lots of agreement on paper, little that follows through in terms of concrete results.”When it comes to Venezuela, though, it has not been for lack of trying.Chavez has visited Iran nine times since taking office in 1999, and Ahmadinejad has made five visits to Venezuela since 2005. Washington has been watching the budding relationship closely, taking what Obama told El Universal were “a number of significant and effective steps to indicate our concern to the Venezuelan government.”Those included the imposition of sanctions last year against Venezuela’s state-owned oil company after it shipped reformate, a gasoline blending component, to Iran. The Venezuelan Military Industries Co. also was sanctioned for dealings with Iran. Two years earlier, the U.S. Treasury imposed sanctions on the subsidiary of an Iranian bank in Venezuela, saying it was helping fund Iranian weapons development.Then, on Sunday, the State Department said Venezuela’s top diplomat in Miami, Consul General Livia Acosta, has been told that she must leave the country by Tuesday. No explanation was given. But in December, a documentary on the Spanish-language Univision network presented evidence supporting allegations that Acosta and officials from Iran and Cuba were plotting a cyberattack on the United States. Venezuela has not responded to the expulsion order.“We do pay attention,” the high-ranking U.S. official said. “And the United States has not hesitated to act when there’s evidence of Iranian malfeasance. And the bar is pretty low.”Correspondent Thomas Erdbrink in Tehran contributed to this report.More world news coverage:- Arab League extends Syria mission- Islamists secure lead in Egypt’s parliamentary elections- Tehran praises U.S. Navy rescue operation- Read more headlines from around the world</td>\n",

       "      <td>‘To lead” and “to seduce” have a single root in the Latin language. They are intimately tied in Venezuela, as well. For all of President Hugo Chavez’s failures as a leader, he was a supremely successful politician, a brilliant beguiler.It is a testament to his seductive powers that after 14 tempestuous years of rule — two of them in the clutches of a devastating illness, which finally claimed his life Tuesday— he continues to have a near-mythical hold on the Venezuelan people. Even as the country crumbled around him, even as he leaves a legacy of ruin, the multitudes adore him. Irish journalist Rory Carroll has gone a long way to explaining this leader-seducer in a riveting expose, “Comandante.”Carroll covered Latin America for the Guardian from 2006 to 2012. While reporting on news of the region, he kept returning to his foothold in Caracas, ever more fascinated by the one-man phenomenon unfolding in the place he called home. Chavez was the big story — the only story. “He bestrode society like a colossus, commanding attention, everywhere his voice, his face, his name. It did not matter whether you despised or adored him; you looked. Covering Venezuela was like wandering through a vast, boisterous audience that simultaneously booed and cheered the titan who turned the presidential palace, Miraflores, into a stage.”“Comandante” traces Chavez’s single-minded rise to power, from a humble boyhood in the dusty town of Barinas through a meteoric trajectory in the army and, eventually, to his 1992 military coup attempt that landed him in prison and made him a national hero. But nowhere is Carroll’s portrait more fascinating than in his account of Chavez winning the presidency in 1999, his subsequent, ubiquitous presence on television and his careful fashioning of Chavismo — a ferocious brand of anti-capitalism with a folksy smile — a cult that is unique in the annals of Latin America.Chavez, Carroll takes pains to explain, was no dictator — he was a democratically elected head of state. Nevertheless, he managed to walk a fine line between pop hero and strongman. As Gabriel Garcia Marquez wrote after spending a day in his company: “I was overwhelmed by the feeling that I had just been .?.?. with two opposing men. One to whom the caprices of fate had given an opportunity to save his country. The other, an illusionist, who could pass into the history books as just another despot.” He was magnetic, funny and well-read, and he managed to convince the majority of his countrymen that things were getting better, even as the nation whirled into an abyss.It is that illusionist we get to know in “Comandante”: Here is a consummate performer, a president who projected himself alongside the image of Venezuela’s national hero, Simon Bolivar, then appropriated live television day after day for hours at a time, “mulling, musing, deciding, ordering.” He chatted up the man on the street, turned cameras on himself during palace conversations, worried over the price of milk with mothers, joked with hard-drinking laborers. “He would sing, dance, rap; ride a horse, a tank, a bicycle, aim a rifle, cradle a child, scowl, blow kisses; act the fool, the statesman, the patriarch.”At any given moment of the day, the figure of the president, with a bright, winning smile and a torso “of reinforced concrete,” would be seen flickering in the living rooms of Venezuela like some strange, Orwellian phantom. Eventually, “Hello, President” — a marathon Sunday program in which the chief executive wandered the streets of Caracas dispensing wisdom, history lessons and cash like a talk show host on steroids — “became like the lottery, everyone looking to get a job, a house, something” from a beneficent government. Never had a country been run like this. Never had Latin America had a leader who thought like Marx and dished like Oprah.Chavez called it a revolution.And a revolution it was. In the course of it, he upended the Venezuelan aristocracy — that old, corrupt, entrenched establishment of oil tycoons and beauty queens. He made the poor his cherished children. To keep firm control of his message, he abolished the ministries’ press offices and centralized the news.He renamed the country the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. He forged ties with Fidel Castro and shunted petro-dollars to Cuba. He nationalized Venezuela’s huge reserves of oil, gave away fortunes, created a new class of rich (merrily referred to as the Boligarchy), built miles of housing for the indigent and, when the bills came around, printed more money until the over-leveraged economy foundered. His goal, when all was said and done? To unite Latin America in a firm alliance of revolutionary republics that would serve as a bulwark against the United States.Firmly anti-American, fiercely populist, Chavez devoted his entire career to turning Venezuela upside down. For him, it was the darker races, the marginalized, the needy, who deserved the country’s riches. Carroll shows how Chavez’s shoddy understanding and willful manipulation of the economy rained misery on the very people he meant to save. We see, in this vivid narrative, a government that is Shakespearean in its failings. By 2000, one year after Chavez was installed, a campaign everyone could believe in — rout the corrupt! elevate the poor! invigorate the nation! — had produced a clone of Cuba’s faltering communist state. “Fatherland, socialism or death!” had replaced the old Venezuelan battle cry, “Patria o muerte!,” and Chavez made no secret that he would go to any length to see that things went his way.Little by little, there were defections. His most devoted lieutenants were increasingly discomfited by his shift to bellicosity, his tendency to oust any official who disagreed. By 2002, his massive and very public firing of government officials prompted a march on Miraflores Palace. What began as a protest turned into a full-blown coup and attendant massacre.State television showed none of it; the opposition’s channel broadcast live footage of the corpses and blood.When Chavez surrendered the palace and was shuttled off into captivity, it didn’t take long for his generals to bring him back. He returned to his presidential seat chastened, but not for long. Who was to say that the violence hadn’t been staged to smear an innocent president?By 2007, when Carroll was asking Chavez why he wanted to abolish term limits for himself but claimed to be aghast at officials who strove to become regional caudillos, all pretense appeared to be over. Chavez’s government now intently began eavesdropping on those it considered suspect. Threats were handed out to anyone who grumbled. As the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration was ushered out, cocaine dollars rushed in. A wave of unimaginable crime followed.There was more: Oil money had made it cheaper to import than to manufacture; cheaper to buy other countries’ food than to invest in agriculture. The poor were eating, but the country was suffering a dire anemia. And although it cost a Venezuelan a mere dollar to fill his automobile tank, inflation soared, topping the charts in the hemisphere. A Boligarch boasted that he had paid $25,000 for a watch; his female counterpart, as much for a party dress.By 2011, this faux economy fooled no one. The judicial system had been virtually shut down. The constitution had been rewritten. Disillusionment among officials was rampant. Protests erupted throughout the country, sometimes as many as 10 a day. The vision of Chavismo had slumped into disrepute, and Latin American presidents, even those who claimed to be Chavez’s friends, politely turned away and looked to Brazil for enlightenment.But to the Venezuelan poor, the president continued to be a beacon. For all the country’s problems, they insisted that his heart was in the right place. As a result, he swept the 2012 elections, his loyalists draping the streets with baffling banners: “Long live Chavez! Down with the government!”Carroll’s book ends b</td>\n",

       "      <td>CARACAS, Venezuela — Angie Rivas grew up in a “Chavista” household, one so supportive of President Hugo Chavez that family members participated in the populist leader’s huge rallies and voted with the masses as he fended off challengers in one election after another.But Rivas, 25, is one of an increasing number of young Venezuelans who have grown tired of the rampant crime and moribund economy, the electrical blackouts and Chavez’s bombastic speeches. This group could be decisive in an election Sunday that will determine whether Chavez rules until the end of the decade.“I was only 11 when Chavez got into power,” said Rivas, who is campaigning for opposition leader Henrique Capriles. “But there are holes in the roads, you cannot find a job, there is crime and problems with health care and education. That’s because of 14 years in which the government hasn’t done anything.”In no other presidential election since Chavez’s first successful run in 1998 has he faced a tougher challenge — a vigorous 40-year-old former governor who, in a mad-dash campaign across hundreds of towns, has built a following by appealing to younger voters. Two recent polls put him roughly even with Chavez.“Young people, undoubtedly, may hold the key that decides this election,” said Juan Mijares, a Capriles campaign coordinator who tracks polling data.The two sides are fighting over an ever-expanding and politically energized segment of the population: the estimated 7.5 million Venezuelans between the ages of 18 and 30 who make up 40 percent of the electorate.In previous elections, the young had veered toward the government’s pledges to transform the country. But the Chavez of today is in many ways a far different man from the one who won by 26 percentage points in 2006 over a stodgy politician named Manuel Rosales.Now 58, Chavez is recovering from chemotherapy, radiation therapy and three operations that he said removed a cancerous tumor discovered 15 months ago in his pelvic area. That has left him bloated and moving gingerly.‘We were invisible’But political analysts say that Chavez is a ferocious campaigner and accomplished orator with a keen insight on how to reach voters, as evidenced by other polls that give him at least a 10-point lead over Capriles.And he has, since the beginning of his political life, adeptly cultivated the young. He created a Ministry for Youth, appointed young people to important positions in a sprawling public sector and hugs his daughters in public.“Viva the young people!” Chavez said in a speech before thousands of mostly young followers last week. “From the fight for independence until now, the best generation has been you, the young people of Venezuela of today! And so I say, fight hard to assure the future that will be in your hands.”To be sure, the president draws support from a multitude of young people in poor districts who believe that his policies of nationalizing private industry and spending Venezuela’s oil income on social programs give them possibilities they would otherwise not have had.“We were invisible, we were questioned, we were criminalized in the past,” said Ruben Loiza, 30, among the organizers of a group of artists, musicians and dancers supportive of the president. “We see Chavez, and we note how our families are thankful because those things that happened in the past are now taking place less and less.”On a recent day, a determined group of the president’s young supporters flooded a busy street, passing out fliers and posters with his image to motorists stuck in traffic.Taking a break from shouting slogans, Sony Sanchez, 27, rattled off various state programs — from subsidized markets to neighborhood medical care — that have benefited her family. She noted proudly that she is studying crisis management at a public university tied to the armed forces, for free.“I think this government has given opportunity to young people to realize their dreams,” she said. “Before, a young person couldn’t be sure of having a place in a university.”Still, that kind of solid support has dissipated as Venezuelan companies have closed and the economy has become ever more dependent on oil. The soaring homicide rate also is particularly worrisome to young people, since most of the victims and perpetrators are young men. Just Saturday, three Capriles campaign workers were killed in the rural state of Barinas in a confrontation with Chavez supporters, officials said.After the trouncing Chavez gave Rosales six years ago, in the opposition’s darkest hour, a group of university students rose up when the president pulled the plug on an opposition TV network and tried to push through a constitutional change that would broaden his powers. They held sit-ins and hunger strikes and organized lively street protests.Roberto Patiño, 23, who recently graduated from college, came of age during those protests. He said an increasing number of young people believe Chavez has become an autocrat whose policies are leading Venezuela to ruin.“Capriles represents the leadership of a team in which we have a role and something to give, where we are needed to build the Venezuela we want,” Patiño said. “On the other side, there is a messianic leader, where Chavez is the only leader.”Struggling to earn a livingGenny Zuniga, a sociologist who closely tracks economic data at the Catholic University in Caracas, the capital, said the country’s troubled economy and what she calls the poor prospects for young workers may drive younger voters to Capriles.She said 42 percent of the working population is in the informal sector, often selling food or clothes on the street, uninsured and without a pension or other benefits. Studies show that half of young adults have only nine years of schooling.“Here, to sell hamburgers at McDonald’s, they ask you for a high school degree,” Zuniga said.But she said that government interventions in private business are making things worse, asphyxiating the economy and making it unable to generate high-quality jobs, and that many young Venezuelans are simply leaving the country.“We don’t have a solid labor market,” she said, “nor do we have a working population that is improving itself.”Concern about the future is what has made Angie Rivas put her stock in a future with Capriles.“I think what Chavez had to give he’s given, and so I’m going to vote for progress,” she said. “A young person dreaming of the future with Chavez sees a future in another country. I think the Venezuelans deserve to dream about a future here in Venezuela.”</td>\n",

       "      <td>CARACAS, Venezuela —Calling himself the “Son of Chavez,” Nicolas Maduro, the interim president, won a slim victory after a brief but nasty presidential campaign in which he had pledged to complete the socialist transformation of this oil-rich nation that began under the man he served loyally for 20 years, President Hugo Chavez.With nearly all the votes counted, electoral authorities said late Sunday evening that Maduro had taken 50.6 percent of the vote to just under 50 percent for Henrique Capriles, a youthful challenger who had only days to mount a campaign against a powerful and tested electoral machine.The vote in this country of 29 million came less than six weeks after Chavez, 58, died at a Caracas military hospital after a long battle with cancer. His death plunged his fervent followers into mourning and gave Maduro, who had been the vice president, the potent sympathy vote in a country where millions had come to view Chavez as a father figure who never failed to reward them with gifts. The victory gives Maduro a six-year term.Days before the vote, polls showed Maduro, 50, a former union activist with close connections to the Castro brothers in Cuba, holding a double-digit lead over Capriles, 40, a lawyer and governor. Capriles lost to Chavez in an October election, dispatched handily despite a long and hard-fought campaign, and his outlook for victory in the days after Chavez’s death appeared grim.But after running an intense campaign, Capriles closed the gap in recent days — leading to a near tie that the opposition may end up contesting. Maduro appeared to recognize that possibility as he spoke to a throng of supporters outside the presidential palace, just as his boss, Chavez, had after electoral victories.“Yesterday and today I said it — I win with one vote, I win. If I lose with one vote, I turn over [power] immediately,” he said. “The electoral authorities said what the people wanted.”The government’s media apparatus — which includes half a dozen TV stations, newspapers and dozens of community radio outlets — deified Chavez and reminded people that he had proclaimed Maduro as his political heir. Chavez exhorted Venezuelans in a Dec. 8 speech to vote for Maduro should Chavez have to give up power, and the clip was played repeatedly on television and at political rallies.Capriles’s aides complained that Maduro’s campaign was backed by the power of the state — from the military, which made sure voters got to the polls, to the various ministries of Venezuela’s large government, which ensured that hundreds of thousands of state workers voted for the ruling-party candidate.Maduro frequently warned that a vote for Capriles would be akin to treason — supporting a diabolical opposition of oligarchs and swindlers who would pillage the country with their masters from the United States, which the government here calls “the empire.”“These are the people of Chavez. This is Chavez’s place. Chavez continues as an example for us!” Maduro shouted in his closing address atop a stage over Bolivar Avenue in the center of Caracas, the spot where Chavez gave dozens of rousing speeches. “I am ensuring the legacy of my commander, Chavez, the eternal father.”Claudio Aguilera, 63, awoke Sunday as millions of other Chavez loyalists in the capital did, to the sound of pre-dawn bugles rousing them to make their way down from their small cinder-block homes scattered across hillsides to the voting stations.“Yes, I voted at 6 a.m., going for Chavismo,” he said, talking about the socialist movement that bears its founder’s name. “Who else would we vote for? We’re not going to vote for the empire and see everything fall apart.”Another Maduro supporter, Jean Leon, 30, spoke of how Chavez had transformed Venezuela for the better so that people like him in poor districts would have a voice.He said it is up to Maduro to fulfill that legacy. “I want to see Nicolas in that chair of our commander,” he said. “May he take that mandate we’re giving him and work the legacy that our commander, Chavez, left behind.”In middle-class neighborhoods of Caracas, though, voters spoke about a dysfunctional economy with the highest official inflation rate in the hemisphere, food shortages and constant power blackouts in provincial towns.Many also spoke about the rampant crime that has made Caracas one of the world’s most dangerous cities and state interventions in businesses that have made Venezuela more reliant than ever on its oil exports.Maria Blasini, 47, who said she was once mugged outside her house at lunchtime, said she thinks Venezuela has spiraled downward since Chavez was first elected in 1998.“We’ve had 14 years of the same thing — instead of making advances, we’re falling behind,” she said. “I voted because we want change. I want security and that the economy is reactivated, that the kids have a future.”Another pro-Capriles voter, lawyer Maria Sanchez, 40, said she wanted a new government that would end the deep-seated, sometimes violent polarization that was one of Chavez’s legacies. She also said the country will need a dramatic restructuring, something akin to President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s New Deal. And, Sanchez said, all Venezuelans must participate. “It won’t be the work of just one person,” she said.In the campaign, though, Maduro and the well-worn political machine that Chavez rode from one election victory to the next targeted the Chavez loyalists, from the hard-liners to those on the fence.Maduro and other aides frequently accused the opposition of crimes, from planning his assassination to sabotaging electrical power stations to make the government look incompetent. He did not provide proof.“Chavez was expert at polarizing in the campaign, because if the government can polarize, then it has the numbers to win,” said David Smilde, an analyst with the Washington Office on Latin America who has spent years in Venezuela researching Chavez’s revolution. But Chavez, he said, would soften up near the end of a campaign, when victory was assured.“Maduro hasn’t done that second part,” said Smilde, co-editor of the book “Venezuela’s Bolivarian Democracy.” “He’s been polarizing right through the end.”Although State Department officials said earlier this year that they had hoped Maduro would be open to improving tattered relations with the Obama administration, his campaign has frequently used the United States as a foil.On Monday, for instance, Maduro blamed the United States after television cameras filmed a band of government supporters beating and throwing rocks at pro-Capriles youths. Just minutes after images began airing, Maduro called the attack “a strange act of violence where a small, very violent group is involved, financed by the United States government.”Emilia Diaz-Struck contributed to this report.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Across Latin America, the pope’s announcement that he will step down at the end of the month is drawing official comment as well as some speculation that the next pope could come from the region. Forty percent of all Catholics are in Latin America, and clergymen from Brazil, Mexico and Argentina are considered contenders for a church that is shrinking in Europe but growing in many developing countries.The president of the Episcopal Conference of Bishops in Venezuela said the move served “as a good example” for having shown that it is best to resign in the face of hobbling incapacity. In public comments, Archbishop Diego Padron also said the pope had the interest of the church and its renovation in mind. “The pope doesn’t usually give out news in pieces,” Padron said.It was not lost on Venezuelans that Padron’s message could have been as easily directed at President Hugo Chavez as to Venezuela’s Catholics. That’s because the ailing Chavez hasn’t been heard or seen by Venezuelans since undergoing a complicated cancer surgery in Cuba two months ago. Since then, the government has only released news on Chavez’s condition in dribs and drabs, delivering few hard facts about the president’s prognosis. That remains a state secret.Meanwhile, Venezuela has been embroiled in an institutional crisis as Chavez’s aides try to deal with a range of crises, from a prison riot that left dozens dead to shortages of toilet paper and milk to sky-high inflation and rampant crime. Chavez’s lieutenants claim Chavez remains in charge, but many Venezuelans do not believe them.The church has long been critical of Chavez’s autocratic rule. And the president has not had kind words for the church, calling the hierarchy in Venezuela “devil's investments.”“This is a luminous moment, a great lesson,” Padron said, speaking of the pope’s announcement. “The pope has been very human, has recognized that he no longer has strength and, with humility, has ended his services. He’s a good example.”Benedict's visit to Mexico in March 2012 is remembered for bringing consolation to a country torn by savage drug violence. Some of the country's criminal gangs even took a break from their murderous ways during his stay. Benedict held a large outdoor mass near the central Mexican city of Leon during the visit, donning a large black sombrero to the delight of the crowds.\"Pope Benedict XVI has always been a friend of Mexico and a messenger for peace and reconciliation,\" Mexican president Enrique Peña Nieto posted to his official Twitter account, offering the \"solidarity and respect of the Mexican government.\"Benedict's March 2012 trip also included a stop in Cuba, marking the first papal visit to the communist-run island since Pope John Paul II's groundbreaking 1998 voyage. Cardinal Jaime Ortega, the country's highest-ranking church official, said Benedict's decision to step down was \"a big surprise,\" but called it \"an invaluable lesson in humility.\"\"The Pope has broken once more with convention, and isn't afraid to tell the world he's too weak and tired to go on with the huge responsibility of governing the Catholic Church,\" Ortega said in a statement.</td>\n",

       "      <td>CHUAO, Venezuela — It has been a week since Hugo Chavez’s landslide electoral victory — but that is not why the president’s supporters are still laughing in Chuao, a fishing village on Venezuela’s surf-pounded Atlantic coast.Last Sunday, in the general hilarity and excitement of the results, a carouser popped a wheelie by Chuao’s colonial-era 17th-century church and fell off his motorbike. When the gas tank ignited in the crash, the bystanders’ laughter soared into the night sky alongside the roaring flames.“At least the motorbike didn’t explode!” grinned Elvis Morillo, a burly Afro-Caribbean fisherman.Chuao is a “chavista” stronghold and also one of those semi-mythic Latin American towns that seem to leap from the pages of a novel. It is accessible only by boat, so that even the town’s new school bus had to be brought in by surfing it on the waves.Two hundred years ago, Simon Bolivar, the South American liberator and Chavez’s hero, passed a night of despair here — and, some say, contemplated suicide until the aroma of the cacao drying on the church patio lifted his spirits.Four years ago, Chavez used Chuao’s cobbled streets and palm-fringed bay as a backdrop for his “Al Presidente” television show. “Hello, Chuao!” he exclaimed at the start of the eight hour talk-a-thon, before declaring a series of new socialist projects.Such histories, old and new, make Chuao a folkloric microcosm of modern Venezuela. It is also why the town and its 3,000 inhabitants help illuminate why Chavez has been reelected president for another six years after what many consider 14 ruinous years in power.“Of course I voted for ‘mi presidente,’?” said fisherman Orlando Santana, while tying up at Chuao’s new stone wharf, built thanks to a $698,000 “revolutionary” reconstruction project, as a broken billboard nearby declares. “Why would I vote for anyone else?”However, Chavez’s political success owes less to revolutionary ideology than to a petrodollar-financed love affair with voters.Black gold flows through Venezuela, the Saudi Arabia of South America but with more oil reserves, and over the past decade Chavez has showered it on Venezuela’s poor. The flow has been immense: $1tn of revenues over the past decade. Yet as Chuao shows, Venezuelan history is replete with natural bounty abundantly displayed: It is Latin America’s traditional, some say pre-modern, way of doing things.Chuao’s ancient hacienda still grows a cacao so fine that chocolatiers, such as France’s Valhrona, consider it the “best in the world.” In colonial times, this “premiere cru” cacao turned Chuao into such a font of wealth — the oil gusher of its day — that it financed the first university in Caracas, a white neo-Gothic structure near the Plaza Bolivar.The education that Chuao provided then and that Chavez provides now — he has expanded university enrolment four times — can be a source of both personal self-advancement and revolutionary renewal, as Chavez so often says.Indeed, when the hacienda’s last owner, the pious Dona Catalina Mexia del Castillo died in 1669, she bequeathed Chuao to the slaves who worked there on the condition that they stayed and grew cacao.Which they did, so forging a distinctively rebellious local popular culture.At religious festivals, masked men dressed as laughing devils castigate onlookers while cackling with laughter. It’s a culture in keeping with a gauche brassiness that is peculiarly Venezuelan, and with which Chavez empathizes.“I’m also a devil. We’re all devils — good devils, because there are bad devils, too,” he had joked to his Chuao audience during his TV show.As elsewhere in Venezuela, not everyone is won over by Chavez’s demagoguery or folksy turns.“I voted for the opposition because I’m the only intelligent person here,” said Juan Velocidad, an overweight beach restaurateur.The waste and corruption of Chavez’s extravagant state-sponsored populism is huge. As they say in Caracas: “Any senior chavista who hasn’t made millions is a ‘huevon,’?” or fool. Yet with 300 billion barrels of oil reserves, worth more than $30 trillion at current prices, people’s lives have improved, and the government still enjoys a huge margin of error.That is just as well, because the 58-year-old Chavez, although he says he is cured of cancer, may have just begun a tricky transition by appointing Foreign Minister Nicolas Maduro, a street-sharp former union bus driver, as his vice president and eventual successor.Not that anyone in Chuao seems worried about such distant political concerns. Here, the smooth continuation of Chavez’s presidency has returned life to the way it was four months ago, before the election hysteria, which is why the burning motorcycle, for now, is the only news worth talking about.— Financial TimesMore world news coverage:- E.U. wins Nobel Prize- Chinese activist faces prison term for publishing environmental books- U.S. looks for solution to Mali crisis- Read more headlines from around the world</td>\n",

       "      <td>THE LATEST bizarre twist in the drama of Hugo Chavez unfolded Monday when the populist ruler returned to Venezuela in the dead of night after two months of incommunicado treatment in a Cuban military hospital. Apart from a couple of tweets, Mr. Chavez has yet to speak or show himself in Caracas, and it’s not clear if he has returned to rule or die. Either way, Mr. Chavez’s role as leader of the anti-democratic Latin American left appears to be up for grabs — and not for the first time, one of his acolytes is trying to fill the vacuum.That would be Rafael Correa, the 49-year-old president of Ecuador. On Sunday Mr. Correa claimed a landslide victory for a new term that will keep him in office until 2017, a decade after he first took power. Like Mr. Chavez’s own reelection in October, Mr. Correa’s was eased by a steeply tilted playing field. Following the Venezuelan caudillo, Mr. Correa won votes by spending billions in oil revenue in an unsustainable spree.And even more than Mr. Chavez, the Ecuadoran ruler strong-armed his country’s media into becoming his personal propaganda apparatus. Mr. Correa’s government, which inherited one radio station in 2007, now runs five television channels — including two confiscated from private owners — four radio stations, two newspapers and four magazines. If that were not enough, the president regularly employs a law allowing him to commandeer the national airwaves at any time of his choosing, for any purpose.Meanwhile, Mr. Correa has intimidated Ecuador’s independent media into virtual silence. Since May, the government closed 11 other radio stations that did not toe its line. A law forbidding biased reporting on political campaigns and allowing dissatisfied candidates to sue over alleged violations forced the media into pallid and skimpy coverage of the alternatives to Mr. Correa, according to a report by the Committee to Protect Journalists — even as government media blatantly ignored the rules.Journalists who try to oppose Mr. Correa are made to pay. A newsmagazine that urged voters to vote down a referendum giving the government still more control over the media was fined $80,000 for violating the law against electoral propaganda. Last year the Ecuadoran group Fundamedios recorded 173 “acts of aggression” against journalists, including one killing and 13 assaults.With reelection behind him, Mr. Correa clearly intends to step up this crusade. He is pressing yet another new law that would create a board to supervise media and impose fines and other punishment for alleged misdeeds. He’s also pushing the Organization of American States to neuter its independent rapporteur on press freedom, who, not surprisingly, has been critical of Ecuador.Mr. Correa’s defenders like to argue that he is more moderate than Mr. Chavez and unworthy of sanction by the United States — which continues to grant Ecuador free-trade privileges. When it comes to media freedom, that assessment is wrong.More on this debate:The Post’s View: Ecuador gambles on WikiLeaks founder AssangeThe Post’s View: Ecuador’s reasonable recourse to libelThe Post’s View: Ecuador’s bully</td>\n",

       "      <td>Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, who went from a young conspiratorial soldier who dreamed of revolution to the fiery anti-U.S. leader of one of the world’s great oil powers, died March 5 in Caracas of complications from an unspecified cancer in his pelvic area.He was 58 and had been president since 1999, longer than any other democratically elected leader in the Americas. Vice President Nicolas Maduro announced the death.Mr. Chavez first revealed in a brief, dramatic television address in June 2011 that he had undergone two surgical procedures in Cuba. He would go under the knife two more times, greatly weakening the once robust leader. Mr. Chavez had been elected in October 2012 to a third six-year term. But he missed his swearing-in ceremony on Jan. 10 while lying gravely ill in a Havana hospital after undergoing what his aides had called a complex operation a month before.(PHOTOS: The charismatic and omnipresent life of Hugo Chavez)The country was plunged into an institutional crisis, with Mr. Chavez’s foes accusing the government of violating the constitution. But Mr. Chavez’s lieutenants managed to buy time until their leader’s pre-dawn return to Venezuela on Feb. 18. He remained at a Caracas military hospital, with his Twitter account bursting out messages such as “Onward toward victory always!! We will live and we will triumph!!”As an obscure 37-year-old lieutenant colonel, Mr. Chavez had led a failed coup in 1992 against President Carlos Andres Perez’s government. Six years later, on Dec. 6, 1998, Mr. Chavez was elected president in a landslide after pledging to replace a broken, corrupt political system and redistribute the country’s substantial oil-fueled wealth.Mr. Chavez left Venezuela deeply polarized, his supporters lionizing him as a courageous rebel determined to take on the elites, and his foes painting him as a dangerous demagogue and strongman.The former army paratrooper promised a revolution and reveled in what he considered a battle to end all vestiges of the power structure then in place in Venezuela, especially its close economic and political ties to the United States.( TIMELINE: The life and rule of Hugo Chavez )Quickly moving to overturn the old order, Mr. Chavez marginalized the traditional power brokers who had held influence in Venezuela, attacked establishment institutions and upended the country’s economy.Combative in olive green uniform and red beret, Mr. Chavez called his opponents “degenerates” and “squealing pigs,” referred to the Catholic Church hierarchy as “devils in vestments” and labeled critics “counterrevolutionaries.”“Oligarchs tremble, because now is when the revolution is going forward,” he warned in 2000, after the constitution had been redrawn and a new legislature dominated by his allies had taken over. “This is going to be delicious; we’re going to deliver a knockout punch to the counterrevolution.”His guiding light was the 19th-century independence liberator Simon Bolivar, whose pronouncements, writings and philosophy found their way into nearly every speech Mr. Chavez gave.The new president renamed the country the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, and he labeled his philosophy Bolivarian. Mr. Chavez sought the unification of South America, reviving Bolivar’s unmet dream. He also called for a rejection of the so-called Washington Consensus, a policy that includes a drop in tariffs, adherence to tight spending, privatizations of state industries and other economic orthodoxy.A gifted, charismatic orator with a keen ability to connect with the poor masses, Mr. Chavez was able to marshal public backing for a series of referendums that created a new constitution and permitted him to bring every important institution — from the legislature to the state oil company — under his control.On the world stage, Mr. Chavez set Venezuela on a collision course with Washington, blaming American foreign policy and U.S.-style capitalism for much of Latin America’s social ills.( PHOTOS: Venezuelans react to death of Hugo Chavez )For an international left that was yearning for a passionate and magnetic leader, Mr. Chavez was a blessing.He criticized the U.S.-led invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan and, in a speech at the United Nations in 2006, said President George W. Bush was “the devil.” He called Tony Blair, then Britain’s prime minister, “an imperialist pawn who attempts to curry favor” with the Americans. He accused Israel of genocide, saying its treatment of the Palestinian people was akin to a “new Holocaust.”Mr. Chavez sought out relationships with assorted rebel groups, rogues and pariah governments. He exchanged letters with Ilich Ramirez Sanchez, a Venezuelan-born terrorist known as Carlos the Jackal, who was held in a French prison. He asserted that Moammar Gaddafi’s Libya was a model of participatory democracy.Closer to home, Mr. Chavez expressed affinity for the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, a potent guerrilla group fighting Colombia’s U.S.-friendly government. His closest aides built a close relationship with FARC commanders, according to Colombian officials, rebel documents seized in army raids and former rebels.Ties to Iran and CubaMr. Chavez particularly irked the United States by building a close alliance with Iran and Fidel Castro’s regime in Cuba, which found in Venezuela a deep- pocketed benefactor to replace the one the communist island lost with the breakup of the Soviet Union.After taking office, Mr. Chavez began providing 100,000 barrels of oil a day to Castro’s government at subsidized rates; in exchange, Castro shipped thousands of Cuban workers, from intelligence agents to doctors and sports trainers, to Venezuela.Drawing from the largest oil deposits in the world, Mr. Chavez embarked on a foreign policy in which oil, provided cheap to prospective allies, was freely used to help build an alliance to counter U.S. influence. In a grandiose plan to unite Latin America, Mr. Chavez formed an alliance he called ALBA, the Bolivarian Alliance for the People of Our America.He bought more than $2.5 billion in Argentine bonds, created a Bank of the South to counter Washington-based multilateral lenders and pledged to build a pipeline across the continent and construct housing, highways and oil refineries.Venezuela’s opaque financing, though, made it difficult to ascertain exactly how many projects were completed. And by 2012, many of Mr. Chavez’s most ambitious projects — a pipeline linking Venezuela to Argentina, the Bank of the South, a refinery in Brazil — had been quietly mothballed, as Venezuela’s economy struggled.Mr. Chavez enjoyed warm ties with most Latin American countries, but his ALBA bloc attracted as members only the anachronistic regime in Cuba and some of the poorest countries in the region, among them Nicaragua and Bolivia.Some officials who worked with Venezuela said they were put off by Mr. Chavez’s revolutionary, anti-U.S., anti-capitalist rhetoric.“His discourse was political, ideological, about the liberation of the Americas, of fighting the forces of imperialism,” said the former governor of Pernambuco state in Brazil’s northeast, Jarbas Vasconcelos, who had tried to obtain Venezuelan financing for an oil refinery. “He imagined commanding a revolution in all the Americas against the United States.”The young ChavezHugo Rafael Chavez Frias was born July 28, 1954, in the sparsely populated plains state of Barinas, the second of six sons of a couple who were teachers. He grew up poor and dreamed of playing major league baseball (he had a gift for pitching).Young Hugo had another passion: reading and listening to stories, his imagination fired by tales about the great battles and the prophetic words of the revolutionaries who had founded modern Venezuela.He had an influential tutor, Jose Esteban Ruiz, a leftist historian who introduced Hugo and his own sons to everything from Machiavelli to Jean Jacques Rousseau’s “The Social Contract.”“Put Marxism in your head, I t</td>\n",

       "      <td>Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez arrived in Cuba in the early morning hours Monday to undergo his fourth cancer surgery in 18 months, after dramatically designating a successor in case his illness forces him to leave office after nearly 14 years.State television images showed Chavez hugging his close associates, including Vice President Nicolas Maduro, the man he says might replace him, before boarding a plane for Havana about 1 a.m.“Long live the fatherland,” Chavez said.One of his closest aides, Elias Jaua, later recounted in his Twitter feed how he had hugged Chavez. “I said, ‘Go and come back,’” Jaua wrote. “And he said, ‘Of course, I’ll be back, Elias.’ Amen!”In his struggle with cancer, Chavez, 58, has returned from treatment in Cuba several times already. But his announcement Saturday that “some malignant cells” had been detected in his pelvic region that would necessitate surgery in Havana’s Cimeq hospital, where he has been treated before, and his instructions that Maduro had his confidence and should take over if necessary, were sober reminders that his illness is proving hard to beat.“If something happens that sidelines me, which under the constitution requires a new presidential election, you should elect Nicolas Maduro as president,” Chavez said, sitting at a table with Maduro at his side. “I ask that of you from my heart.”Moises Naim, a former Venezuelan government official who is an analyst at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington, called the announcement “basically a farewell speech.”“He said goodbye to power,” Naim said. “It’s a statement full of resignation and appeals to God. There is no plan. The only talk of the future is that there will be elections, and he asks for people to vote for Maduro.”Chavez’s departure from office would mark the end of a tumultuous rule in which the leftist former army officer harnessed Venezuela’s considerable oil wealth to shower the poor with social programs while engineering a sharp diplomatic shift away from the country’s historical ally, the United States.Chavez’s government forged alliances with some of Washington’s most intransigent adversaries, including Cuba, Iran and Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. He has used his lock on practically all levers of power, from the courts to the congress, to push forward the nationalization of hundreds of private companies and the seizure of wide swaths of farmland.For Venezuela’s opposition, the possible scenarios that Chavez discussed in Saturday’s address amount to the first time the president has publicly acknowledged the severity of his illness and the impact it could have on the future of the country.No one in the government is authorized to discuss Chavez’s medical condition except Chavez himself, who astonished his countrymen in June 2011 by telling them he had gone under the knife twice to remove a malignant growth. A third surgery followed in February.Chavez has never disclosed what kind of cancer he has or where it is located. He has twice pronounced himself cured, without providing details.“It was time to tell the truth to the country,” said Maria Corina Machado, an opposition member of the National Assembly. “Venezuela has been living with a lot of uncertainty. In a democratic country where the constitution is obeyed, the president must talk about his health when it is compromised.”Should Chavez die or have to resign, the constitution calls for Venezuela to stage presidential elections within 30 days. Maduro, a 50-year-old former union organizer and bus driver who has risen through the ranks of Chavez’s movement, would become the candidate of the president’s United Socialist Party.The constitution also requires that the vice president fill in for the president should he be temporarily absent. Chavez has spent many weeks in Cuba in the past 18 months, undergoing chemotherapy and radiation treatments. But he has remained in charge of the government, signing decrees and bills from Havana.Machado said the opposition will call for a strict interpretation of the constitution now that Chavez has suggested the possibility of stepping aside.“Article 233 of the constitution is clear about the only mechanism, an election within 30 days,” she said. “He can’t name a successor. It’s the Venezuelan people who decide.”An election would mean a contest between Maduro and the opposition’s leader, Henrique Capriles.Capriles lost to Chavez in the presidential election held Oct. 7, with the incumbent winning 55 percent of the vote to the challenger’s 44 percent. Polls, though, have shown that Capriles is more popular in Venezuela than all of Chavez’s closest associates, including Maduro.The president’s swearing-in for another six-year term is scheduled for Jan. 10, but his announcement, following weeks in which he remained out of public view, raised questions about whether the inauguration will take place.“This is how life goes,” Chavez said in his televised address, which prompted his followers to gather in churches and public squares to pray and chant slogans supporting him. “God willing, I hope to be able to give you good news in the coming days.”</td>\n",

       "      <td>CARTAGENA, Colombia — President Obama concluded a contentious hemispheric summit on the defensive Sunday as it ended without agreement on whether Cuba’s Communist leaders should be invited to the next meeting, something the United States firmly opposes.The standoff meant that the sixth Summit of the Americas ended without an official declaration — a negotiated statement of shared principles from the hemisphere’s heads of state — and left open the question of whether there would be a seventh such meeting.The ambiguous conclusion underscored the fact that Obama, while pledging a new relationship with the United States’ leery southern neighbors, has had little success in bridging significant policy differences that have divided the region for decades.With the scandal involving a number of Secret Service agents and prostitution coloring the weekend meeting, Obama departed here with the U.S. image mildly blemished and the enduring political differences between the hemisphere’s wealthy north and rising south firmly intact.“I’m not somebody who brings to the table here a lot of baggage from the past, and I want to look at these issues in a new and fresh way,” Obama said during a Sunday news conference with Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos. “I am sometimes puzzled by the degree to which countries that themselves have undergone enormous transformations, that have known the oppression of dictatorships or have found themselves on the wrong side of the ruling elite, and have suffered for it, why we would ignore that same principle here.”Cuba and the decades-old U.S. embargo against it, which Latin American and Caribbean leaders derisively call a “blockade,” has been a traditional bone of contention between the United States and much of the rest of the region.But it emerged here as only one of several issues, including U.S. anti-drug and monetary policy, that together illustrated how far the United States remains outside the hemisphere’s political consensus.The summit was more buttoned up than the previous one three years ago, largely because several of the region’s most anti-American leaders did not attend. The cultural programming around the meetings showcased this lovely seaside city and the progress made by Colombia, where an array of drug-funded armed groups has faded in recent years.Santos attributed Colombia’s success in part to the billions of dollars in U.S. aid over the past decade. But the open criticism directed toward the U.S. approach to several issues also underscored the new confidence felt by Latin American leaders as they guide a region that is improving economically while the United States struggles to find its financial footing.Although Obama has presented the United States as a more equal partner in hemispheric affairs and has spoken forcefully on issues such as inequality that have defined Latin American politics for years, some of his policies fall outside the region’s mainstream. He defended them staunchly, nonetheless.Many leaders here pushed for a new strategy to combat the illicit drug trade, fueled by U.S. demand. Some proposed legalization — for possession and by regulating the trade — but Obama made clear here that he does not believe it would prove more effective than the law enforcement approach funded by the United States.“I think it is wholly appropriate for us to discuss this issue,” Obama said, adding that while Colombia is emerging from a “wrenching period,” several “smaller countries” in Central America are “starting to feel overwhelmed” by drug violence. “It wouldn’t make sense for us not to examine what works and what doesn’t.”New leaders emergingAs the Castro brothers in Cuba grow old, Venezuela’s Hugo Chavez battles cancer and other important regional leaders leave office, Latin America is determining which new leaders will emerge.A tacit competition has shaped up between Brazil and Colombia, both growing economically and benefiting from a skilled business class. The summit showcased their leaders, who were sometimes at odds with Obama.Santos and Brazil’s Dilma Rousseff, who visited the White House last week, publicly criticized U.S. monetary policy for devaluing the currencies of developing countries.And Santos worried aloud whether America is “exporting unemployment” to Latin American countries that have weathered the global economic downturn better than the United States.“We all have the feeling of the enormous opportunities we have to work together,” Santos said at his news conference with Obama, putting the best light on their differences.There were moments of agreement, too. Obama announced here Sunday that Colombia has complied with a key condition of the free-trade agreement passed last year that is designed to better protect labor activists from political violence.The labor certification allows the deal to take effect May 15. U.S. exports to Colombia last year totaled $14.8 billion, and the agreement will eliminate tariffs on 80 percent of U.S. consumer and industrial goods bound for the country and phase the rest out over the next decade.But the election-year decision has angered U.S. labor leaders, who say Colombia has not made enough progress in protecting union activists in Colombia and in punishing those who commit crimes against them.In a letter to Obama last week, AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka wrote that “less than 10 percent of the nearly 3,000 cases of trade unionists murders since 1986 have reached a conviction,” and that “none of the 29 labor activists killed in 2011 had their cases resolved by a successful prosecution.” The labor group endorsed Obama for president last month.“We all know that more work needs to be done, but we have made significant progress,” Obama said of Colombia’s labor rights record.Cuba issue still resonatesCuba, a historic wedge issue between the United States and its closest political allies in the region, overwhelmed the summit’s final day.Under U.S. pressure, Cuba’s Raul Castro was not invited to this meeting, and many influential regional leaders, led by Rousseff and Santos, indicated that they would not attend another without Cuba.Ecuador’s president, Rafael Correa, declined to attend the summit in protest, and other leading leftists close to Cuba, including Nicaragua’s Daniel Ortega, did not show up.Chavez, who usually thrives on the attention of regional forums, was also not present, because of illness.But the issue still resonates throughout Latin America, evoking the Cold War-era political divide between left and right that Obama on Sunday said had ended.“The fact of the matter is that Cuba, unlike the other countries participating, has not moved to democracy, is not respecting human rights,” Obama said. “I’m hoping the transition takes place.”More on this story:Campaign themes resonate at summitObama promotes initiative to connect small businesses in the AmericasColombia presents its new faceHilary Clinton in Colombia dances, drinks beer</td>\n",

       "      <td>CNN Chile reported the death of long-ailing Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez last night, news that the country has braced for since he disappeared from the public eye in December. But even as social media erupted with the news, other sources -- including CNN’s corporate parent -- said the report couldn’t be verified. Multiple sources now say that it’s false. These mistakes happen, of course, especially in a news cycle that moves at the speed of tweets. But the mix-up seems especially telling in Venezuela, where very few know Chavez’s health status.The president left the public eye in December, when he went to Cuba for medical treatment. The Post’s Juan Forrero reports from Caracas that while officials have claimed Chavez is closely involved in the government’s day-to-day operations, opposition leaders have grown increasingly suspicious.Venezuelans still don’t know what kind of cancer Chavez has or what his prognosis is. And Chavez was too ill to attend his own inauguration on Jan. 10, leaving a leadership vacuum in his wake. In fact, the president’s most public appearances these days are on Twitter, where he sends messages like this one: “We have returned again to the Venezuelan homeland. Thank God!! Thank you beloved homeland!! Here we continue treatment.” The CNN Chile report relied on the word of Guillermo Cochez, Panama’s ex-ambassador to the regional Organization of American States. According to Cochez, Chavez had been brain-dead and on life support since Dec. 31, and died on Feb. 23 after his daughters asked to remove his breathing tube.“I challenge the Venezuelan government to refute me,” Cochez told CNN Chile, asking them to present Chavez publicly if he is, in fact, still alive.But there are plenty of reasons to doubt Cochez, as Gideon Lichfield has pointed out at Quartz. For one thing, Cochez has made these kinds of claims before. And a photo of Chavez and his daughters released in mid-February doesn’t appear to show a man on life support.This morning, NBC Latino quoted sources in Venezuela saying Chavez is alive and hospitalized in Caracas, with “no change” in his condition. Vice President Nicolas Maduro told the Telegraph that he recently had a five-hour meeting with Chavez, and that the president’s poor health has not stopped him from “giving orders on all aspects of the economic, social and political life of our country.”Cochez had one thing right: Until Chavez makes a public appearance, it's very difficult to know for sure.</td>\n",

       "      <td>CARACAS, Venezuela — Venezuela’s government on Monday defended a presidential election that authorities said gave interim leader Nicolas Maduro a six-year term, backtracking on a pledge he had made to permit an audit of ballots demanded by the opposition after the razor-thin victory.Henrique Capriles, who had challenged Maduro in the Sunday election, which was held six weeks after President Hugo Chavez’s death, insisted that he had won the vote and called for a hand count of all the paper ballots.Maduro, though, was proclaimed the winner Monday by the National Electoral Council, which certified the victory in a ceremony broadcast on national television, paving the way for his inauguration Friday.“There is no doubt here about who won the election,” Elias Jaua, the foreign minister and a former vice president, said in a speech in which he defended the election result and characterized the country’s electoral system as the best in the world. “Venezuelans, let’s feel proud of yesterday’s vote.”Soon after Maduro’s victory was announced Sunday night, Vicente Diaz, one of the rectors of the electoral council, called for an audit of the vote.Minutes later, Maduro announced to a crowd of supporters outside the presidential palace, “We’re going to do it.”“We’re not afraid. Let the boxes talk — that the truth be told,” said Maduro, 50, referring to the cardboard boxes that hold ballots.But by Monday morning, the potent state media apparatus played one interview after another of observers and politicians praising Venezuela’s automated voting system.And the electoral council — which is made up of five members, four of them allies of the government — made clear that it would not support a recount.“The Venezuelan electoral system worked perfectly,” said Tibisay Lucena, president of the council. “Venezuela is the country in the Americas with the most lively and vibrant democracy.”On Monday, though, Capriles declined to concede and cited 3,200 instances of irregularities in the voting process, as well as the use of Venezuela’s well-worn electoral machine to get the vote out for Maduro.Capriles, 40, said his campaign had asked electoral authorities not to proclaim Maduro the winner pending a hand count of the ballots. He said the opposition’s estimates of the vote showed that he had secured a narrow victory over Maduro.“Here the fight is not against the people,” said Capriles, a governor and lawyer. “It’s a fight of the people against an illegitimate government.”He called on Venezuelans nationwide to bang pots and pans in protest — and they did. Some students in Caracas also clashed with National Guard troops, who fired tear gas and rubber bullets.Francisco Lopez, 29, was among those who congregated in Altamira Plaza in the heart of opposition country. “I don’t know what’s going to happen,” he said, “but we’re going to defend the vote.”Observers, though, said the opposition’s push had little chance of being heard in a country where the president controls all institutions.“The abuses of this government, the advantages they have, I’ve never seen it anywhere,” said Ignacio Arcaya, a former diplomat in Chavez’s government who is now in the opposition. “In a country with no judicial independence, how could you expect that there will be any change?”And Maduro’s response in a televised news conference was to call opposition leaders part of a cabal designed to replace his government with one that would permit the United States to plunder the country.“Their plan is not a democratic plan but a coup-plotting plan,” Maduro said.The dispute over the election result came a day after he was expected to garner a resounding victory.The former union activist turned vice president had the sympathy vote after Chavez died following a long battle with cancer, and some pollsters put Maduro’s pre-vote lead in double digits.But the margin of victory was less than two percentage points, just six months after Chavez beat Capriles by 11 percentage points to win a third six-year term as president. Maduro won, the electoral council said, by more than 260,000 votesIn Washington, White House spokesman Jay Carney called Capriles’s request for an audit of votes an “important, prudent and necessary step” to ensure that Venezuelans have trust in the election result. The Washington-based Organization of American States offered to help Venezuela with a possible audit.The Venezuelan government rejected such calls as meddling in internal affairs, with officials here instead touting congratulatory messages sent by allies, including Russia, Argentina and Cuba.Still, the narrow margin of victory was a letdown for many in the government, whose leadership had been predicting a landslide, arguing that a vast majority of Venezuelans supported Chavez’s radical transformation of the country into a socialist state. It means that Maduro will begin his term without the mandate that his boss enjoyed.“Teflon was limited to Chavez,” said Michael Shifter, president of the Washington-based Inter-American Dialogue, a policy group. “The sympathy for Chavez proved more fleeting than expected. In the end, absent charisma, issues mattered. So do campaigns. Capriles proved adept in taking advantage of a weak opponent and a nation that Chavez left in sorry shape.”Indeed, even in the high echelons of the Chavista ranks, at least one powerful official appeared troubled by the slim margin of victory. Diosdado Cabello, a former military man with close ties to rich executives who have lucrative state contracts, said, “The results oblige us to make a profound self-criticism.”The comment was significant because analysts and politicians here view Cabello as Maduro’s rival. And his ties to powerful generals in the military are at sharp odds with the alliances that Maduro has with social groups and with the Cuban government.Maduro “has the type of background that the military doesn’t always appreciate,” said Javier Corrales, an Amherst College expert on Venezuela. “Some people say that the military never loved the ties to Cuba, and Maduro is very open about his ties to Cuba.”Corrales said Maduro does not appear to have the kind of ability that Chavez had to hold together the disparate coalition that makes up Chavismo, from the military to radical Marxists, from business executives to armed groups in the slums and the masses of poor.“The Chavistas, especially in the leadership, are going to say, ‘You’re having trouble maintaining the coalition,’ ” Corrales said. “Chavez, to his credit, was able to put together the most successful coalition between radical leftists and the military.”Scott Wilson in Washington contributed to this report.</td>\n",

       "      <td>CARACAS, Venezuela — With cancer-stricken President Hugo Chavez battling for his life, the Obama administration has embarked on a discreet but concerted weeks-long diplomatic initiative to open channels of communication with his sharply anti-American government.The effort to break through a years-old deep freeze with one of the world’s top oil suppliers comes as Venezuela plunged deeper into an institutional crisis Wednesday over Chavez’s long absence since undergoing surgery Dec. 11 in Cuba.But American officials have been preparing for a post-Chavez scenario, one in which they can engage Caracas on a variety of concerns the State Department has had about the Venezuelan government’s policies. They include the close alliance Venezuela has built with Iran, extensive narco-trafficking through Venezuelan territory and prickly economic issues important to U.S. companies, such as their inability to repatriate earnings from here because of currency controls.“Regardless of what happens politically in Venezuela, if the Venezuelan government and if the Venezuelan people want to move forward with us, we think there is a path that’s possible,” State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said Wednesday. “It is just going to take two to tango.”Nuland spoke with reporters soon after Venezuela plunged deeper into an institutional crisis over Chavez’s absence. The 58-year-old leftist firebrand, who has not been seen publicly in a month, has been so hobbled by his illness that the government announced he would not attend his inauguration Thursday for a fourth term.Opponents say that his latest six-year term ends Thursday and that if he does not appear for his swearing-in, the head of the National Assembly must assume leadership on an interim basis.But Wednesday, the Supreme Court in Venezuela ruled that the inauguration could be postponed and that Chavez actively remains head of state, even though his health status is a mystery.“We have determined that there is not even a temporary absence,” the court’s president, Luisa Estella Morales, told reporters. She said the court also did not see any “merits” in appointing a medical board to determine the state of Chavez’s health, as his opponents have demanded in recent days.Exploratory talksIn the event that he dies or becomes too incapacitated to recover, Chavez has said that Vice President Nicolas Maduro, a confidant of the president and a former union leader, should be the successor.Maduro is considered an ideologue close to Cuba’s Communist leadership and in lock step with Chavez’s long-standing policy of distancing Venezuela from the United States, which had been a close ally until his presidency began in 1999. As foreign minister, a position he still holds, Maduro has led Chavez’s campaign to forge closer ties with U.S. adversaries such as Iran.But Maduro is also seen as a negotiator, and the Americans have begun their exploratory talks in part by seeking him out, said a senior U.S. official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the delicate nature of the talks with Venezuela.In November, Roberta S. Jacobson, the assistant secretary of state for Western Hemisphere affairs, spoke by phone with Maduro, the senior official said. There also have been meetings in Washington between Kevin Whitaker, a deputy assistant secretary of state, and Roy Chaderton, the Venezuelan ambassador to the Organization of American States, which is based in the city.“I would characterize it as a handful of conversations that have taken place,” the U.S. official said. The Obama administration, the official added, has in recent weeks “had more echo and better luck” engaging Venezuela than in the past seven years, when the relationship started to splinter badly.The official, as well as people who have worked with Maduro in Caracas on foreign-policy issues, cautioned that the talks are designed to simply find a channel of communication.“We want to start small and go from that, diplomacy 101,” the official said. The idea is to then go on to broader talks on issues important to the United States, including oil, drug trafficking and terrorism, and, principally, Venezuela’s ties with the Iranian government — which Washington is working to isolate.At this stage, with Venezuela convulsed by a constitutional crisis, the talks are delicate.Last week, Maduro publicly stressed that the contacts with the Americans were not designed to jump-start relations should Chavez die. Maduro said the president had, in fact, authorized the conversations.“We stressed the need for respect for the revolutionary and democratic process in Venezuela,” he told state television.The U.S. official said the talks began because diplomats and the White House thought the moment was apt, with President Obama and Chavez having been reelected in the fall. “We were looking at four years, at least, going forward,” the official said.But moving forward will not be easy.“I don’t think there are great illusions about having some partnerships or of any quick and dramatic change in the relationship,” said Michael Shifter, a policy analyst in Washington.Hostility toward WashingtonA central ideological pillar of Chavez’s rule over 14 years has been to oppose Republican and Democratic administrations in Washington, which he accuses of trying to destabilize his government.“I think they really believe it, that we are out there at some level to do them ill,” said Charles Shapiro, president of the Institute of the Americas, a think tank in San Diego.As ambassador to Venezuela from 2002 to 2004, Shapiro met with Chavez and other high- ranking officials, including Maduro. But the relationship began to fall apart, with Chavez accusing the United States of supporting a coup that briefly ousted him from power. U.S. officials have long denied the charge.Shapiro recalled how Maduro made what he called unsubstantiated accusations about CIA activity in Venezuela, without ever approaching the embassy with a complaint. He said that as time went by, the United States became a useful foil for Chavez and most Venezuelan officials withdrew contact.“A sure way to ruin your career, to become a backbencher, was to become too friendly with the U.S. Embassy,” Shapiro said.On a practical level, the Venezuelan government stopped cooperating with Washington’s counter-drug operations and for years was accused of assisting guerrillas in neighboring Colombia, the closest U.S. ally in the region. Under Maduro’s watch as foreign minister, Venezuela became friendlier with pariah states such as Syria, Libya and Belarus.Roger Noriega, who oversaw the George W. Bush administration’s policies in Latin America from 2003 to 2005, said the U.S. diplomatic initiatives could legitimize Maduro.Noriega said that if Chavez dies, there would be a power struggle between Maduro and the head of the National Assembly, Diosdado Cabello, who is allied with the military and is a power broker among the nouveau riche who benefited from the government’s free-spending ways. Noriega said the United States should wait until the dust settles.“This is an heir to a guy who’s been unrelentingly hostile to the United States and really doing his bidding,” Noriega said of Maduro. “Did they see that this is a very convoluted, complicated succession, a power struggle within Chavismo, and they’re meeting with one of the protagonists in this power struggle?”But two former Chavez loyalists who now oppose the government — former congressman Jose Albornoz and Vladimir Villegas, a former deputy foreign minister — said Maduro’s experience as a diplomat and union negotiator would make him a more promising negotiator for the Americans than Cabello.Albornoz said that although Maduro has a radical edge, he is pragmatic and has a “geopolitical vision.” The former congressman also said that Venezuela’s dire problems require cooperation with the United States and an imaginative approach by diplomats.“The relations with the United States have to be redefined,”</td>\n",

       "      <td>CARACAS, VENEZUELA — All week long, from the moments before President Hugo Chavez died and in the days that followed, the man Chavez picked to succeed him has thundered from the podium against oligarchs, transnational oil companies and the United States.Nicolas Maduro, who was sworn in as president Friday after Chavez lost a battle with cancer, is poised to govern this oil-rich country until at least 2019 and carry on with the same policies as his boss.On Saturday, the country’s electoral board said a presidential election, as mandated by the constitution after the death of a president, would take place April 14.Minutes later, Venezuela’s coalition of opposition groups said it had decided to offer its candidacy to Henrique Capriles, a lawyer and governor of Miranda state who challenged Chavez in the presidential election in October.Pollsters and political analysts say that Capriles’s charisma and seasoning as a campaigner could be too little to defeat Chavez’s chosen successor so soon after his death, which has left the country in an unprecedented state of loss. As Chavez’s loyal aide for a generation, the 50-year-old Maduro not only has the country’s sympathy vote but now controls the purse strings that have given the government a major boost in one election after another.With the outcome of an election nearly foretold, many Venezuelans are asking themselves what kind of president Maduro might be — a conciliator open to healing wounds or a demagogue who uses his position to control all the levers of powers, as critics say Chavez did.Once seen as reserved, Maduro has come out in recent speeches with not only the same bellicose rhetoric as Chavez but also a similar fire-and-brimstone cadence. He has pledged to keep alive El Comandante’s flame by saving the poor from greedy elites operating here and in the United States, which he calls Venezuela’s “historic enemy.”“Sooner rather than later the imperialist elites who govern the United States will have to learn to live with absolute respect with the insurrectional peoples of America,” he said moments after receiving the presidential sash in Friday’s inauguration. “We’ve decided to be free, and nothing and no one will take that independence that was re-conquered with our commander Hugo Chavez at the helm.”As Maduro became more visible in recent weeks, people here wondered if the beefy former bus driver would as president turn out to be the calm apparatchik some diplomats found him to be. That Maduro was said to be pragmatic, a negotiator with the patience to sit down with adversaries, a leader open to resolving the polarization Chavez helped create in 14 years in power.But the picture that is emerging of Maduro — particularly in the past four days of mourning for Chavez, who died Tuesday afternoon — is of a leader who appears to be ready to accelerate the former president’s agenda. That is shaping up to mean insults and threats such as the ones Maduro has issued this past week. And for Venezuela’s beleaguered opposition and the press, it may mean renewed efforts to corral them.“I thought he represents the most orthodox of socialist thought, of the doctrinaire socialist thought that Chavez defended,” said Demetrio Boersner, a historian and columnist. “He’s doing all he can to apparently speak like Chavez and follow Chavez’s style in all its details so that the popular masses see him as a kind of son of Chavez, that he’s saying what the fallen caudillo [strongman] would say.”Maduro, to be sure, was the man chosen by Chavez as his successor, a decision Chavez made public on Dec. 8, when he went on national television to instruct Venezuelans to vote for Maduro should he be forced from the presidency. Chavez never gave another speech.Even before Chavez died, Maduro had begun to fire off incendiary accusations against Venezuelan leaders, the press and the United States. Just before Chavez’s death, he went on national television and implied that the United States was behind Chavez’s cancer, having “infected” him.To a State Department official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the delicate nature of relations with Venezuela, Maduro’s speech was consistent with how Chavez managed relations with Washington. “And in that respect,” the official said, “it wasn’t very encouraging.”It also wasn’t very encouraging to Venezuelans in the opposition or the large segment of the population that pollsters say are tired of the political sectarianism in Venezuela.Maduro has railed against the “rancid oligarchy,” accused Capriles of plotting against the government and warned of hazy destabilization efforts. He also has stressed repeatedly that he is an accidental president with no designs on power and that, as such, will closely follow Chavez’s guiding principles.“I swear, in the name of the most absolute loyalty to commander Hugo Chavez, that we will obey the constitution, with a firm hand of a people who are free. I swear!” he said at the inauguration Friday.Javier Corrales, a Venezuela expert at Amherst College, said that like Chavez, Maduro is finding that blaming others can pay off politically, particularly as serious economic problems mount.“He has discovered, as Chavez did, that seeking to be in the extreme of the ideological spectrum is his safest spot to avoid attacks from the left, provoke the opposition and transform the political arena into a shouting match,” Corrales said.Many observers — among them government opponents and those in Chavez’s movement — say that Maduro appears to be trying hard to appeal to the masses who liked the former president’s rhetoric while ensuring that “Chavismo” holds together.But there are pitfalls, namely that he may not sound authentic to some, particularly if problems such as rampant crime, inflation, food shortages and a dysfunctional economy grow worse.“He’s trying hard to copy him,” said Carlos Berrizbeitia, an opposition lawmaker. “But he doesn’t have the same tone, because he doesn’t have the same discourse and charisma that Chavez did.”This week, many rank-and-file Chavistas — dressed in red, their eyes red from crying — spoke on the street of how they would continue to follow the directions of their dead leader. And all of them remember how Chavez had told them in his last public comments to support Maduro.“Of course I’ll do as El Comandante told us to do,” said Maria Andrade, 54. “So if the elections were tomorrow, well, I’m sure that all the Venezuelans would be in the street going to vote for Maduro.”Emilia Diaz contributed to this report.</td>\n",

       "      <td>On May 8, 1967, two small boats carrying a dozen heavily armed fighters made landfall near Machurucuto, a tiny fishing village 100 miles east of the Venezuelan capital, Caracas. Their plan was to march inland and recruit Venezuelan peasants to the cause of socialist revolution.The eight Venezuelans and four Cubans who took part in this mad adventure were on a mission from Fidel Castro. It was the heyday of Cuban agitation abroad, with Cuban-backed guerrilla cells spreading throughout Latin America.The fighters sent to Machurucuto had bad luck, though. A local fisherman spotted their abandoned boats and notified the Venezuelan military. An all-night gun battle followed. Little more than 72 hours after landing, nine of the guerrillas were dead and two others captured. Just one got away.The first and only foreign military invasion of Venezuela of the past hundred years was a three-day-long fiasco.The Machurucuto Incident, as this tiny drama came to be known, was the opening salvo in Castro’s decades-long obsession with bringing socialist revolution to Venezuela. With a shared Caribbean culture and vast oil wealth, Venezuela was a tempting target for Fidel from the start.His big break came nearly three decades later, in December 1994, when a Venezuelan lieutenant colonel fresh out of a two-year stint in jail for leading an ill-starred coup attempt landed in Havana for a hero’s welcome.As a clandestine conspirator, like his entire generation of Latin American wannabe revolutionaries, Hugo Chávez had idolized Fidel Castro. Castro sat enraptured as the dissident gave a keynote address to the University of Havana live on state television, raising the young Chávez’s stature immeasurably. The two struck up a famously intimate friendship.In 1998, against all the odds, Castro’s protege was elected to Venezuela’s presidency, and the dream of Machurucuto came roaring back to life. Together, the two men forged an unprecedentedly close relationship. Billions of Venezuelan oil dollars flowed into Castro’s coffers as tens of thousands of Cuban “technical advisers” — doctors, sports trainers and an unknowable number of spies — spread throughout Venezuela. Cuba’s flag flew side by side with our own at Venezuelan military bases. Chávez’s personal security detail was handed over to Cuban intelligence.Finally, in 2007, Chávez declared that Cuba and Venezuela were a single nation. “Deep down,” he said, “we are one single government.”It was simply unprecedented: the virtual invasion of a larger, more powerful country by a smaller, weaker one at the larger country’s behest. Cuban methods for stamping out the free press and snuffing out dissent very gradually began to spread throughout Venezuela.Cuban infiltration of Venezuelan state institutions — both military and civilian — was complete, with Cuban “advisers” watching over virtually every single office, institute, ministry, barrack and embassy of the Venezuelan state. Reporting directly back to Havana, this web of spies led to a bizarre situation where Castro often had a clearer intelligence picture of what was happening inside the Venezuelan state than the Venezuelan state itself. Chávez, by all accounts, simply trusted Castro’s spies more than he did his own.In 2011, the Machurucuto incident cycle was completed when Fernando Soto Rojas, one of just three guerrillas who lived to tell the tale of the 1967 invasion, was elected speaker of Venezuela’s National Assembly. An aging communist without much of a political machine of his own, he had ridden his Cuban revolutionary street cred to the pinnacle of the Venezuelan state.Later that year, when Chávez fell ill with cancer, the full extent of his devotion to Castro was revealed as a matter of life and death. Though the world’s premier cancer specialists in Brazil, France and the United States lined up to offer him cutting-edge treatment, Chávez refused to be seen by anyone other than the Cubans. Absent for long spells in a Havana hospital, Chávez’s health became a state secret — and a Cuban state secret, at that. Castro had detailed knowledge of Chávez’s condition when nobody in Caracas did.If there’s one maxim Castro was devoted to throughout his life, it’s the idea that knowledge is power. Knowing Chávez’s cancer was terminal months before anyone else did allowed the Cubans the decisive edge in the high-stakes jockeying to select his successor.There was no secret whom Castro favored: Nicolás Maduro may have been a gray, uncharismatic politician, but he was a Fidelista through and through. A former radical bus union organizer, Maduro had come up through the ranks of Liga Socialista, a militantly pro-Cuban fringe party he joined as a teenager. The closest thing to a university education he had came in 1986and 1987 when, as a 24-year-old, he undertook two years of intense ideological training at Cuba’s school of political training, along with communist activists from seven other Latin American countries.For years as Chávez’s foreign minister, he had never shown the slightest deviation from Havana’s line. Maduro was the man Castro could trust to secure Cuba’s interests in Venezuela after Chávez’s death. And succeed Chávez he did.In the long history of Castro’s sprawling record of international adventurism — from Nicaragua and Bolivia to Congo, Angola, Israel and beyond — Venezuela is but one chapter.Success came late, but when it did it was complete. On the day he died, Castro left Venezuela the way he had dreamed since his youth: radically unfree and shackled to a Marxist dictator wholly subservient to Cuban interests.Dictatorship in Venezuela is Castro’s greatest foreign policy victory, the cornerstone of his hemispheric legacy.

       "      <td>HAVANA — The protests that erupted Friday in Havana at airline offices and outside Ecuador's Embassy were a rare occurrence in this tightly controlled society, where street demonstrations and anti-government activism are essentially forbidden.As such, the protests were an opportunity to see the Cuban government's extensive security apparatus in action. In a part of the world where police often respond to demonstrators with riot shields, tear gas and clubs, the Cuban government showed how it can squelch any disturbance with subtle psychological messaging and a chess-game approach to controlling the streets.The protests flared up after the Ecuadoran government announced a new visa requirement, effective Dec. 1, in an attempt to stop Cubans from using their country as a springboard to the United States. For those who had laid down their life savings for an airline ticket, the rules had suddenly changed, potentially leaving them unable to travel or get a refund. They were incensed.It didn't really matter to Cuban authorities that the immediate target of the protesters' ire was Ecuador, not the communist government. Cuban officials have long insisted they cannot afford any unrest that potentially gets out of hand, lest the Americans use it as an excuse to intervene. The government keeps a tight lid on any anti-Castro activity, and dissident groups like the Ladies in White who attempt weekly protest marches are hauled off and handled roughly.But Friday's event was different because it wasn't planned. And it was loaded with risk, since it was driven by Cubans determined to leave, just like the 1980 occupation of the Peruvian Embassy that led to the Mariel boatlift.By late morning Friday, when it became clear that airlines were not offering refunds, an angry crowd of several hundred gathered outside the Ecuadoran Embassy in the city's Miramar neighborhood, demanding visas and chanting, \"Give us our money back!\"Uniformed Cuban police officers flooded the area, but more impressive was the deployment of plainclothes security agents. They seemed to appear out of nowhere, some dressed in sneakers, ripped jeans and gold jewelry, making them nearly indistinguishable from the protesters. Others appeared to be moving casually among the crowd.Only the uniformed police were armed, and they had no helmets, clubs or other riot gear, let alone armored vehicles. Instead of projecting force with a show of weapons or equipment, the Cuban agents with their sheer numbers gave the impression that they were everywhere, and the situation was never out of their control.Calmly, methodically, Cuban police and security agents began carving up the neighborhood around the Ecuadoran Embassy like a chessboard, closing streets and isolating the cluster of protesters from onlookers or anyone who might consider joining them.Now the protesters were hemmed in. They were free to leave, but not to return. After that it was mostly just a game of attrition.Government trucks arrived with metal barricades to fully seal off the area. More plainclothes officers and security agents poured in, then soldiers and special forces troops, nearly all of them unarmed.By late afternoon, it began to rain, and many of the protesters gave up at that point, knowing the embassy would be closed over the weekend. A smaller number refused to leave.\"We had to go to the bathroom right in the street, in front of the police,\" said Yalena de la Oz, 30, who said she spent Friday night in the street with other protesters who insisted they wouldn't go until they had visas. She has a flight to Quito on Dec. 2.The government kept its barricades and police lines in place through the weekend, knowing it would need them Monday.By Monday before dawn, de la Oz was back along with several hundred others demanding a response from Ecuadoran officials. By then, the barricades were so extensive that the protesters had to stand two blocks from the embassy. There were easily as many police and soldiers as demonstrators. Entire families sat on the sidewalks with their packed suitcases.The crowd finally dispersed Monday afternoon when Ecuadoran Embassy officials said they would begin issuing visas to Cubans who had already purchased flights. Cheers went up as some in the crowd went running to make photocopies of their passports and plane tickets.Cuban migration to the United States has surged to its highest levels in decades this year, partly on fears that better ties with the United States will mean an end to the unique immigration benefits they received under the Cuban Adjustment Act of 1966.U.S. and Cuban officials met in Washington on Monday for regularly scheduled talks on migration issues but remained at an impasse, as the U.S. side said the Adjustment Act isn't up for discussion. The presence of some 3,000 U.S.-bound Cuban migrants stranded in Costa Rica has put new focus on the issue; the migrants were stopped when Nicaragua recently closed its southern border to them.On Tuesday morning, a few hours after the meeting in Washington, Cuban authorities said they will reinstate the exit visa system for many categories of doctors, saying the measure was needed to stop a brain drain that is undermining the island's public health system. Cuban physicians will have to apply for permission to travel abroad starting Dec. 7, just as they did before 2013, when the government lifted its widely despised exit visa requirement.</td>\n",

       "      <td>CNN Chile reported the death of long-ailing Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez last night, news that the country has braced for since he disappeared from the public eye in December. But even as social media erupted with the news, other sources -- including CNN’s corporate parent -- said the report couldn’t be verified. Multiple sources now say that it’s false. These mistakes happen, of course, especially in a news cycle that moves at the speed of tweets. But the mix-up seems especially telling in Venezuela, where very few know Chavez’s health status.The president left the public eye in December, when he went to Cuba for medical treatment. The Post’s Juan Forrero reports from Caracas that while officials have claimed Chavez is closely involved in the government’s day-to-day operations, opposition leaders have grown increasingly suspicious.Venezuelans still don’t know what kind of cancer Chavez has or what his prognosis is. And Chavez was too ill to attend his own inauguration on Jan. 10, leaving a leadership vacuum in his wake. In fact, the president’s most public appearances these days are on Twitter, where he sends messages like this one: “We have returned again to the Venezuelan homeland. Thank God!! Thank you beloved homeland!! Here we continue treatment.” The CNN Chile report relied on the word of Guillermo Cochez, Panama’s ex-ambassador to the regional Organization of American States. According to Cochez, Chavez had been brain-dead and on life support since Dec. 31, and died on Feb. 23 after his daughters asked to remove his breathing tube.“I challenge the Venezuelan government to refute me,” Cochez told CNN Chile, asking them to present Chavez publicly if he is, in fact, still alive.But there are plenty of reasons to doubt Cochez, as Gideon Lichfield has pointed out at Quartz. For one thing, Cochez has made these kinds of claims before. And a photo of Chavez and his daughters released in mid-February doesn’t appear to show a man on life support.This morning, NBC Latino quoted sources in Venezuela saying Chavez is alive and hospitalized in Caracas, with “no change” in his condition. Vice President Nicolas Maduro told the Telegraph that he recently had a five-hour meeting with Chavez, and that the president’s poor health has not stopped him from “giving orders on all aspects of the economic, social and political life of our country.”Cochez had one thing right: Until Chavez makes a public appearance, it's very difficult to know for sure.</td>\n",

(AP Photo/File) “I was the first Western journalist inside the KGB headquarters in 1990,” Eric Margolis told PBS, recounting his venture into the heart of the Soviet Union’s once-fearsome intelligence service, which had just collapsed along with the empire that it served. “The generals told me that the Vatican and the Pope, above all, was regarded as their number one, most dangerous enemy in the world,” he said. Mikhail Gorbachev, the final Soviet leader, once said of the Cold War’s peaceful end, “It would have been impossible without the pope.” That pope was John Paul II, Benedict XVI's predecessor, whose reign from 1978 to 2005 saw him assert a remarkably prominent role in global politics. Benedict never quite met John Paul's benchmark, traveling less and playing a smaller role both within and outside of the Catholic world.

Anthony Stevens-Arroyo asked the question on The Post's OnFaith site: Will all popes after Benedict XVI abdicate? It is a most modern idea to view the pope as CEO of a global corporation, rather than as a living saint chosen by God. This perspective defines church authority according to the modernizing influences of the II Vatican Council (1962-1964) and breaks with the feudal traditions of medieval Christendom, when popes - like emperors - ruled until they died. I predict that Pope Benedict XVI’s legacy will be remembered more as a progressive step towards modernity rather than a pontificate with very conservative pronouncements. A scholar and promoter of change at the II Vatican Council where as a young cleric he was afforded the status of peritus or “expert,” Joseph Ratzinger was sometimes liberal and sometimes conservative but always thoughtful. Unlike a purely pragmatic administrator, his papacy demonstrated an academician’s sensitivity to human history and theological nuance. Consider how his encyclical Caritas In Veritate was chock-full of nuance for both sides of every issue. Predictably, some decided to attribute to Pope Benedict only the parts that were conservative (gold), and reject what was liberal (red), and the Web site of the Catholic League lists, much like a cafeteria menu, mostly his conservative stances omitting papal statements for redistribution of wealth and concern for the environment. Thus, as a very complex thinker, Benedict knows that the future church requires more intellectual and physical vigor than he could have mustered. Moreover, the deterioration in the health of his predecessor, Blessed John Paul II, during the pedophilia crisis probably influenced his thinking about papal abdication.

Roughly three-quarters of Catholics (74 percent) said they were satisfied with “the leadership provided by the Pope” according to a 2012 Pew Research Center survey, with 34 percent “very satisfied.” Overall, about one in five were dissatisfied (21 percent). High-level satisfaction with the Pope (34 percent) was a bit lower than for local parish priests (49 percent) and Catholic nuns in the United States (50 percent). Still, the Pope was more popular than American bishops generally (24 percent very satisfied). Catholics offered a more muted personal reaction to Pope Benedict in a May 2010 CBS News/New York Times poll, a survey that detected dissatisfaction with the church’s handling of child sexual abuse scandals. Some 58 percent of Catholics said the Vatican has done a poor job handling reports of past sexual abuse of children by priests, while 31 percent thought they did a good job. In that poll, 43 percent of Catholics had a favorable view of Pope Benedict, 17 percent unfavorable and 38 percent unsure/not heard of him. That was up from a 27 percent favorable rating in March 2010. Only 25 percent of Catholics said Benedict's leadership has helped the Church, while 15 percent said he hurt it, and 48 percent saw mixed results. In 2002, almost twice as many Catholics said Pope John Paul II had helped the church. 4:46 pm Caitlin Dewey Pope defended abdication in 2010 Pope Benedict XVI is the first pope to abdicate in living memory -- a fact that has led many to question whether popes can step down at all. An analysis in the National Catholic Reporter on Monday ruled that abdication is allowed, though there's little historical precedent. The Reporter also found that Benedict has defended the practice himself. In \"Light of the World,\" his 2010 book-length interview with journalist Peter Seewald, the pope said: \"If a Pope clearly realizes that he is no longer physically, psychologically, and spiritually capable of handling the duties of his office, then he has a right and, under some circumstances, also an obligation to resign ... \"When the danger is great one must not run away. For that reason, now is certainly not the time to resign. Precisely at a time like this one must stand fast and endure the situation. That is my view. One can resign at a peaceful moment or when one simply cannot go on. But one must not run away from danger and say someone else should do it.\" Benedict's resignation letter, which discussed his failing health, echoed the 2010 statement. 4:38 pm Caitlin Dewey Papal frontrunners on Twitter When Pope Benedict XVI joined Twitter last year, he generated a huge amount of online buzz for an institution that's often criticized for its approach to the Internet. Benedict's @Pontifex account has attracted more than 1.5 million followers with just 34 tweets. And while that figure is an improvement over no Twitter presence, the pope's account is only the 763rd most popular account on Twitter. So, how might his successors fair? Just a handful of the papal frontrunners (four out of 12), appear to have Twitter accounts. You can follow them by clicking the buttons below.

       "      <td>He once drove a bus across the gritty streets of Caracas, Venezuela’s capital, and later rose through the ranks of the trade union movement.Now Nicolas Maduro, Venezuela’s tall, broad-shouldered 50-year-old vice president, has been anointed as the possible successor to President Hugo Chavez, should the populist leader’s recurring cancer force him from power.The president’s decision to name Maduro as his heir astonished the oil-rich country, where many view Chavez as a messiah-like leader with no equal after 14 years in power.In a dramatic televised address Saturday, Chavez extolled Maduro as having the “heart of a man of the people.” With Maduro seated at his left, Chavez said he had proved his mettle by loyally serving the government for years, the past six as foreign minister, hopscotching the globe.“He is a complete revolutionary, a man of great experience despite his youth, with great dedication and capacity for work, for leading, for handling the most difficult situations,” said Chavez, 58, a former lieutenant colonel who took office in 1999. “I’ve seen it. We’ve all seen it.”The president said that it was his “firm opinion, clear like a full moon, irrevocable, absolute, total” that Venezuelans should vote for Maduro should Chavez’s condition sideline him and trigger a new presidential election. The constitution requires an election within 30 days of a president being forced from office.Political analysts said the announcement appeared designed with two purposes in mind: to signal Chavez’s strong support for one man and to quell Maduro’s rivals within the president’s movement, known as Chavismo. Early Monday, 27 hours after his address, Chavez boarded a flight to Cuba, where he is to undergo his fourth operation in 18 months on the stubborn cancer in his pelvic area.“He has to make sure those inside will respect him, that he is able to control and tame the internal monsters,” Luis Vicente Leon, who runs the Datanalisis polling firm in Caracas, said of Chavez. “There are divisions in Chavismo, and strong ones, and they can be dangerous in the future if not managed.”Leon said that in Maduro, the president has a time-tested leader who has risen from street-level socialist activist to president of the National Assembly to foreign minister, a post he continues to hold. In October, Chavez named Maduro his vice president, giving him more prominence in a government where cabinet members are juggled and ousted frequently.“Look where Nicolas is going, the bus driver,” Chavez said at the time.Those who’ve known Maduro describe him as jovial and friendly, a man who enjoys socializing and eating sub sandwiches. But he also apparently has a spiritual side: He used to travel to India with his wife, Cilia Flores, also a Chavez loyalist, to hear the advice of Sathya Sai Babaa, a guru who had a worldwide following until his death in 2011.Chavez, who met Maduro in the 1980s when he led a clandestine group of rebellious army officers, had other options. His older brother, Adan, introduced him to radical politics. His former vice president, Elias Jaua, who rose up from university rabble-rouser, has been a fixture. Then there is National Assembly President Diosdado Cabello, a former military man and coup plotter whose name means “God-given hair.”An old friend and associate of Maduro, Vladimir Villegas, said that choosing the vice president made the most sense.“He is a leader who has credibility on the street, who comes from the union movement, who has been a diplomat, who brings together all the conditions,” said Villegas, a former deputy foreign minister who broke with the government in 2007. “I think it is a good decision by the president. This calms those who fear a military man who’s not Chavez.”Venezuelans are accustomed to seeing a serious-sounding Maduro inaugurate infrastructure projects or make revolutionary pronouncements from foreign capitals. But Maduro can also get emotional about Chavez’s self-described revolution and his loyalty to the president.“Chavez has a people at his side. He has us and he will have us always in this battle, from one victory to another!” Maduro, holding back tears, said Monday in an address in Venezuela. “Beyond this life we’ll be loyal to Hugo Chavez!”Unlike several Chavez associates who served in the military, Maduro was in the Socialist League movement in the 1970s and traveled to Cuba for lessons in union organizing. After serving on the assembly that rewrote Venezuela’s constitution after Chavez took office, Maduro began his rise in government.But it has been as foreign minister that he has won even the respect of some of the government’s adversaries. Maduro worked to build close ties to powers such as Russia and China, which has given billions in loans to Venezuela. Officials in Colombia, meanwhile, say Maduro has played an important role in President Juan Manuel Santos’s nascent peace process with a 48-year-old communist guerrilla movement.Despite Chavez’s public show of confidence, Maduro does not face an easy road to power, should the president resign or die. The most apparent challenge is that he is not Chavez, nor does he have the charisma or same mystical connection with the poor that the president enjoys.“Charisma is something that is earned and it’s not passed down just through an election or tapping someone as your successor,” said Susan Eckstein, director of the Latin America studies program at Boston University. If the cancer forces Chavez aside, Maduro faces an energized opposition led by Henrique Capriles, a 40-year-old lawyer who was defeated handily by Chavez in an October presidential election. But Capriles has done well in past polls against Chavez’s associates, including Maduro.Some observers also say that even with the president’s call on Saturday for “unity, unity, unity” among his associates, Maduro may be unable to hold together the divergent political interests evident in Chavismo.Some of Chavez’s lieutenants – perhaps most notably Cabello, who is close to the powerful military wing – have their own supporters and resources, said Raul Salazar, a former general who once worked closely with the president.“I don’t think it will be very easy for Maduro because groups that had been repressed will awaken,” Salazar said. “The power is concentrated for Chavez and if Chavez is there it’s there for him. But once he’s gone, it dilutes.”</td>\n",

       "      <td>HUGO CHAVEZ may be dead, but the offensive he led against democratic institutions in Venezuela and across Latin America has not slackened. In fact, it may be accelerating, especially with regard to independent media.Last week the beleaguered owner of the last Venezuelan television station not subservient to the government announced that he was selling his shares to a businessman close to the ruling party. Guillermo Zuloaga, the majority owner of the Globovision network, was forced into exile in the United States in 2010 by the Chavez regime; now his network faces financial ruin because of repeated, multimillion-dollar fines levied on its news coverage. “We are in a completely polarized country on the opposite end of an all-powerful government that wants to see us fail,” Mr. Zuloaga explained.The silencing of Globovision will leave Venezuela with nine television networks, including five that are state owned and broadcast nearly incessant government propaganda that the four privately-owned channels won’t dare to challenge. The story of Globovision explains why. The network was charged with “sowing panic” for reporting on an earthquake, fined $2.2 million for its coverage of a bloody prison riot and, most recently, accused again of spreading panic for questioning whether the delay of Mr. Chavez’s presidential inauguration during his final illness violated the constitution — which it clearly did.The assault on the free press is by no means limited to Venezuela. In Argentina, President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner also has been trying to silence critical media, including leading newspapers such as La Nación, Clarín and Perfil. Last month her commerce minister ordered private supermarkets and appliance retailers, including Wal-Mart and Carrefour, to stop their media advertising for two months.The measure was nominally intended to complement a government price freeze, but the biggest victims were the three newspapers, which are known throughout Latin America for their hard-hitting reporting and professionalism. Clarín’s advertising from these private firms fell from 264 pages in January to 61 in February, while the other papers lost 15 to 20 percent of their income. The government long ago withdrew all of its own advertising from the papers; its intent is to force them to adopt the self-censorship that has already overtaken most Argentine media.The pressure on free press is one reason why the most valuable institution of the Organization of American States is its independent Inter-American Commission on Human Rights and its rapporteur on press freedom. The rapporteur’s office has been fearless in reporting on abuses of media freedom by governments in the Western hemisphere, while the commission has issued protective orders to shield threatened journalists.Now, however, the commission and rapporteur are themselves under assault. Ecuadorian President Rafael Correa, who aspires to replace Mr. Chavez at the head of the region’s anti-democratic left, has been campaigning to defund the rapporteur’s office, limit the commission’s authority, and move its headquarters out of Washington. He has announced he will attend an OAS foreign ministers meeting next Friday to press his case. Governments that vote with Mr. Correa will essentially be sanctioning the suppression of independent media across the region; those that are democracies must stand up for free speech.Read more from Opinions: The Post’s View: Ecuador’s president, suppressing the mediaJackson Diehl: The end of a human rights heavyweight?The Post’s View: Human rights in the Western Hemisphere</td>\n",

       "      <td>CARACAS, Venezuela — Nicolas Maduro was sworn in Friday as president after a disputed presidential election that has sharply divided the country between Venezuelans who want to continue the socialist system begun by his charismatic predecessor, Hugo Chavez, and those who contend that the ruling party won through a fraudulent vote.The inauguration, which many Latin American leaders but no U.S. diplomat attended, came a day after the National Electoral Council ruled that an audit of Sunday’s voting could take place. The decision mollified opposition leader Henrique Capriles, who said that by reviewing millions of votes “we can show the country the truth.”For Chavistas, as those in government call themselves, the inauguration of Maduro signaled the continuation of Chavez’s self-styled revolutionary government, now in its 15th year in power.“I’m president of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela,” said Maduro, 50, using the name Chavez gave Venezuela to reflect the importance of independence-era hero Simon Bolivar. “I am going to govern this country the next few years. I’ll know what I’m going to do. I have the know-how. The commander, Hugo Chavez, prepared me to assume responsibilities.”But Maduro’s presidency started off shakily, with a man in the ruling party red storming the podium in the National Assembly and grabbing at the microphone as the new leader began his inauguration speech. State television quickly turned the cameras elsewhere for viewers nationwide, and Maduro was unhurt as bodyguards seized the intruder.“The security has failed completely,” Maduro said. “They could have shot me.”He then said that the incident was a reminder of the importance of security — a reference to the larger message he has hammered all week, that his government needs to guard against coup plotters who he says want to oust him with the Obama administration’s help.“Fascists!” Maduro said. “They disguise themselves, but they have very evil intentions against not just our people but against the people of the continent.”Before the presidents of Argentina, Brazil, Cuba, Iran and several other countries, Maduro characterized his government as a peaceful model of hope facing down a threat that he equated with Nazi Germany. He pledged to defeat his opponents, not just for Venezuela’s sake but for the good of Latin America.“We need to act on time,” he said in rambling comments that lasted nearly two hours. “Europe did not act fast enough against the Nazi threat.”Inauguration protestedMaduro’s presidency starts off at a time of intense political crisis, with the opposition claiming that it won the election by a hair, citing hundreds of irregularities in polling booths nationwide. The electoral council said Maduro won by nearly 270,000 votes out of 14.9 million cast, a margin of victory of less than 2 percent.The uncertainty means that Maduro, a former bus driver and union activist, lacks the political mandate that Chavez enjoyed in one electoral victory after another. Chavez, who first won office in 1998, died last month after a battle with cancer, plunging his followers into grief and prompting Sunday’s snap election to decide who would finish his term.“To be able to do anything with the country deeply divided and 49 percent of the population questioning if you even have a right to be president is going into it with your hands tied behind your back,” said Cynthia Arnson, who directs the Latin America program at Washington’s Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars.As Maduro was inaugurated, protesters banged pots and pans from doorways and windows and played salsa music, as Capriles had requested in a Twitter message.Still, the streets were less tense after the electoral council’s decision on the audit, which was a surprising reversal because that body is stacked with government supporters. Earlier in the week, the council insisted that a review of the voting was not necessary, fending off demands by the opposition for a vote-by-vote recount.That led to street demonstrations Monday and Tuesday that government officials said left eight people dead and dozens wounded. Then on Thursday, Tibisay Lucena, the head of the council, said an audit of 12,000 boxes loaded with votes would be conducted, taking a month to complete.The examination by technicians will include comparing the paper receipts that were emitted by voting machines with a registry of the voters who cast ballots at each machine.Though he had initially asked for a more extensive and complex recount, Capriles, 40, a lawyer and governor, said the council’s decision creates a possibility of resolving the crisis. “We know where the problems were,” he said, “in those 12,000 is where the problems were.”The government said 54 percent of the vote had already been checked after the voting Sunday. Now, the council said it will scrutinize the other 46 percent of the votes.Capriles said his campaign had detected 3,200 voting irregularities, including gunmen at polling stations, rolls that included dead voters and polling stations where opposition officials were forced out.Decrying the oppositionMeanwhile, state-run TV and radio stations continued to paint a picture of the opposition as a violent, anti-democratic force whose leaders go to drastic ends to thwart the voice of the people. Broadcasts feature one official after another accusing Capriles and his closest aides of planning violence and threatening legal action.Maduro and other officials have said the opposition has even attacked clinics. “These are crimes that are a product of racism, social racism,” the new president said in his inauguration, adding that his foes targeted Cuban medical personnel in particular.Capriles has shot back that the government staged the violence to blame its adversaries and sway public opinion while launching a crackdown leading to beatings and detentions. “Stop chasing the people, stop,” Capriles said Thursday, directing his comments at Maduro.Arnson, the Woodrow Wilson analyst, said that the electoral council’s decision and Maduro’s acceptance were positive developments. But she also wondered how it would turn out, with Maduro now the president.“Venezuela excels in bizarre situations in governance,” she said. “So you have agreed to an audit that takes a month to do and at the same time you have Maduro being inaugurated.”</td>\n",

       "      <td>CARACAS, Venezuela — On aisle seven, among the diapers and fabric softener, the socialist dreams of the late Venezuelan president Hugo Chávez looked as ragged as the toilet paper display.Employees at the Excelsior Gama supermarket had set out a load of extra-soft six-roll packs so large that it nearly blocked the aisle. To stock the shelves with it would have been pointless. Soon word spread that the long-awaited rolls had arrived, and despite a government-imposed limit of one package per person, the checkout lines stretched all the way to the decimated dairy case in the back of the store.“This is so depressing,” said Maria Plaza, 30, a lawyer, an hour and a half into her wait. “Pathetic.”Depressing, in an otherwise bright, modern supermarket that sells $100 bottles of Spanish wine, Jack Daniel’s whiskey and organic rice puffs.Pathetic, in a country with the world’s largest petroleum reserves and oil prices at nearly $95 a barrel, yet unable to supply basic goods because of its crumbling local currency and a shortage of U.S. dollars.“Soon we’ll be using newspaper, just like they do in Cuba!” said an elderly man nearby, inching forward in line. “Yeah! Like Cuba!” others shouted.The fate of Venezuela’s revolution, it seems, will be decided at the supermarket.Nearly a year after Chávez’s death of complications from cancer at age 58, his handpicked successor, Nicolás Maduro, is struggling to contain food shortages, spiraling inflation and rampant crime.The arrival of basic staples such as cooking oil, chicken, flour or milk brings Venezuelans running to supermarkets and touches off surreal mob scenes, even as the government imposes price caps and rationing to prevent hoarding.Maduro squeaked past opposition candidate Henrique Capriles in April’s presidential election, and Maduro’s United Socialist Party won enough races in Dec. 8 local elections to push back against perceptions that Chávez loyalists were deserting him. Just before the vote, with television cameras rolling, he sent soldiers into an appliance store accused of price gouging and ordered huge markdowns on televisions and microwaves. Apparently it gave his party a final boost at the polls.Only the shortages and overall sense of unraveling seemed to have worsened since then.Each day the arrival of a new item at Excelsior Gama brought Venezuelans flooding into the store: for flour, beef, sugar. Store employees and security guards helped themselves to the goods first, clogging the checkout lines, and then had to barricade the doors to hold back the surge at the entrance.“The store owners are doing this on purpose, to increase sales,” said Marjorie Urdaneta, a government supporter who said she believes Maduro when he accuses businesses of colluding with foreign powers to wage “economic war” against him.“He should tell the stores: Make these items available — or else,” she said.But store managers said they are putting scarce, price-capped supplies out on the floor as soon as they arrive from government-run distribution centers.Venezuela’s real problem, economists say, is that a shortage of U.S. dollars is squeezing the ability of the government and the private sector to import. Even in upscale Caracas shopping malls, international chain stores such as Zara and Gucci are gutted, their employees standing around with nothing to sell and the mannequins left naked.While the government has fixed the exchange rate of the country’s currency, the “strong bolivar,” at 6.3 to the dollar, the widely used street rate is more than 10 times higher. Inflation was 56 percent last year — officially — and in an oil-warped economy that depends heavily on imported goods, businesses can’t get the dollars they need to restock their shelves. Even Venezuelan-made items go scarce as factories struggle to obtain replacement parts and raw materials.Political breathing roomVenezuela’s parliament has granted Maduro temporary decree powers, and analysts say he has the political breathing room this year to make unpopular economic adjustments, such as raising state-regulated gas prices, the lowest in the world. “The distortions have become too large,” said economist Luis Zambrano. “And this year is the first in a long time that there are no elections.”Maduro’s government also plans to grease the wheels by selling at least $5 billion in U.S. money — at nearly twice the official rate — to companies trying to shed bolivars and secure hard currency. Economists liken this to a de-facto devaluation — a recognition that the strong bolivar is, in fact, quite wimpy.After his annual address to parliament last month, Maduro declared 2014 “the year of the ultimate triumph in the economic war,” announced a new team of economic managers and decreed a law capping business profits at 30 percent.“You can be sure we will be inspecting everyone, sooner or later,” Maduro warned, part of the “New Economic Order” he vows to create.‘Too dangerous to go out’But if the president’s fiscal policies are anything like his response to rising crime, the country looks to be in trouble.The Jan. 6 roadside killing of former Miss Venezuela Monica Spear in a botched robbery attempt jolted a country long-numbed by one of the world’s highest homicide rates and near-total criminal impunity. Fear is so widespread that shopping mall kiosks offer “Express Armoring” for motorists who want their vehicles bulletproofed, fast.Despite calls for an overhaul of Venezuela’s woeful police forces, Maduro said violent soap operas were to blame and warned broadcasters to clean up their content.Most Venezuelans are too busy just trying to secure the basics. Residents from the country’s interior say the shortages are even worse outside the capital.“There’s nothing to buy where we live,” said Maria Valencia, a preschool teacher from the oil-producing hub of Maracaibo, near Venezuela’s western border, while shopping at a government-run Bicentenario supermarket where products sold by recently nationalized companies carried little heart symbols and the phrase “Made in Socialism.”Valencia and three family members had filled their cart with corn oil, four bottles each, the maximum. “This stuff is gold,” she said.Shoppers here were more inclined to blame the scarcities on badly behaved countrymen whom they said were trying to profit from the situation.“All Venezuelans are to blame for this,” said Jeanpierre Sifontes with a shrug, his cart loaded with cooking oil, discount beef imported from Brazil and two Sony-brand karaoke machines.“We need something to do at night because it’s too dangerous to go out,” Sifontes said.Maduro, like Chávez, still counts on the broad support of the poor Venezuelans who have benefited from a reallocation of the country’s oil wealth, such as the new government apartment towers all over Caracas, the city’s expanding subway system and even cable-car gondolas to ferry poor favela dwellers high up into the hillside slums.But with the country’s economy wobbling and inflation falling heaviest on the poor, Maduro isn’t taking any chances, and many of his recent moves have put military officers in key government posts.As a former paratrooper, Chávez didn’t need to prove his mettle to the country’s armed forces, said Margarita Lopez, a political analyst in Caracas. But Maduro is less secure and seems to be trying to win loyalty by steering more power and resources to the military.“The military was never this visible under Chávez,” Lopez said. “It’s going to be a very difficult year.”Emilia Diaz-Struck contributed to this report.</td>\n",

       "      <td>CARACAS, Venezuela — A vast crowd of red-clad Venezuelans filled the streets of the capital Wednesday to mourn President Hugo Chavez, as governments across Latin America began looking ahead to an election that will determine his successor and the direction of the South American energy giant.Chavez’s flag-draped coffin was slowly carried through the streets of Caracas over the course of the day, on a route winding toward the military academy where he started his career as a young cadet from a poor rural family. His body will lie in state there until his official burial on Friday.Chanting “Chavez lives!” the mourners poured into central Caracas from rough hillside barrios and rural towns, vowing that their hero’s self-styled socialist revolution would endure beyond his death.“He gave us the instructions and we will all follow them. We are all Chavez,” said Elia Cuba, a 59-year-old accountant.Specifically, Chavez instructed his supporters to vote for Nicolas Maduro, the country’s interim president and the man now tapped to carry forth the leftist blend of socialism, nationalism and electoral patronage known as “Bolivarianism,” after 19th-century independence hero Simon Bolivar, Chavez’s idol.Even as several of Chavez’s closest allies arrived in Caracas to bid farewell, governments were scrambling to calculate what his death might mean beyond Venezuela. Although he irritated the United States with his alliance with Iran, Chavez built many relationships through his leftist ideology and multibillion-dollar oil diplomacy, which injected Venezuela and its shaky politics into many economies.Chavez forged particularly close ties to Cuba, providing Havana with about 100,000 barrels of subsidized oil a day, and receiving in return thousands of Cuban workers, from intelligence agents to doctors and sports trainers.“Latin America has never had a more generous benefactor than Chavez,” said Michael Shifter, president of the Washington think tank Inter-American Dialogue.“His death doesn’t mean an abrupt cutoff of such aid, but it will probably result in a gradual reduction, especially as economic difficulties and fiscal pressures become more acute in Venezuela,” Shifter said, citing the country’s huge debts, soaring inflation and chronic shortages.Chavez was the first of a wave of Latin American leftist leaders who have won and held on to office since the Cold War era, and now figures such as Ecuador’s Rafael Correa, Bolivia’s Evo Morales and Argentina’s Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner say they will carry on Chavez’s goals for regional integration.The government has announced that an election will be held within a month, but with no date set, speculation is growing that Maduro could try to schedule the vote for as soon as possible, capitalizing on the emotions unleashed by Chavez’s death after a nearly two-year bout with cancer.Maduro is expected to face opposition leader Henrique Capriles, who lost to Chavez by 11 percentage points in October’s presidential election.‘He awoke a people’Among Chavez followers there are also fears of a potential power struggle between Maduro and another Chavez loyalist, National Assembly President Diosdado Cabello. “We want Nicolas [Maduro],” said Nelly Leticia Castillo, 50, choking up with emotion as she said her farewell. “I hope he and Diosdado can come together.”David Smilde, a Venezuela expert at the University of Georgia, said he did not expect significant changes to come to Latin America following Chavez’s death, given that the leader’s endorsement is likely to boost Maduro at the polls.“First, Maduro, who will likely win the presidency in the coming elections, was his foreign minister for the past six years and architect of Venezuela’s involvement in the region,” Smilde said.“Chavez’s legacy is his legacy, and there will likely be continuity,” he said.Throughout the day Wednesday, Venezuela’s vast state television apparatus played Chavez’s speeches and ran footage of him hugging followers and saluting adulatory crowds. State newspapers declared that even in death he remained “the guiding light” of this country of 29 million.Chavez underwent a fourth cancer surgery in Cuba on Dec. 11 and never recovered, nor did he appear publicly again. He died at a military hospital here at 4:25 p.m. Tuesday, two weeks after arriving from Havana, where he was being treated, in the middle of the night.Marlenis Vanegar, 75, said she had prayed for the president outside the military hospital, where groups of Chavistas — as Chavez’s followers call themselves — had gathered for vigils. “He left a legacy for us,” she said. “He awoke a people. Don’t anyone think that this revolution will now be lost. We will continue with the candidate that he left for us.”Unofficial campaignThe death of the leader seemed, at least for the moment, to bring a sense of relative calm to Venezuela, with the volume turned down on the political vitriol that had characterized the discourse of government officials and Chavez opponents in recent days.“In the immense pain of this historic tragedy that has affected our fatherland, we call on all the compatriots to be vigilant for peace, love, respect and tranquility,” Maduro said on national TV. “We ask our people to channel this pain into peace.”Capriles told the country that now was “not the time to highlight what separates us.”Still, as Chavez lay in agony in recent days, it had begun to appear as if an unofficial campaign had already begun, with Maduro and Capriles directing highly personal attacks against each other. In a tense political environment, much of the country was talking about what would come after Chavez’s death. Now, Venezuelans are awaiting word on when the election will be held.In the meantime, the Interior Ministry ordered a ban on alcohol sales and the carrying of guns in public through Tuesday.The country is also wondering where Chavez will be buried. The leader had ordered a huge modernist mausoleum built for Bolivar — a structure that critics say looks like a skateboard ramp — in the center of Caracas. And now, many wonder whether Chavez’s body will wind up there.“For his political brilliance and commitment to the country, Commander Chavez has earned his place beside the Liberator Simon Bolivar in the Pantheon,” said a longtime Chavez associate, Freddy Bernal, in comments quoted by the Reuters news agency.Nick Miroff contributed to this report</td>\n",

       "      <td>Questions are swirling as to whether President Hugo Chavez will make it back to Venezuela in time for his scheduled Jan. 10 inauguration -- or at all.While the opposition is advocating for a transfer of power to the head of the National Assembly, many Venezuelans are still praying for Chavez's swift recovery from cancer surgery, the reason he flew to Cuba on Dec. 11.[Click here for a timeline of Chavez's life]\"We have no idea what to expect. I pray for his recovery but I am expecting the worst,\" Joaquín Cavarcas told the Guardian.Formula One driver Pastor Maldonado told the Associated Press that he and millions of other Chavez supporters have \"much faith that he's recovering.\"Although Chavez's popularity has waned in recent years, he still won his most recent election by 9 percentage points. So how did Chavez, arguably an autocrat who presides over one of the most dangerous countries in South America, get so popular? Basically, welfare programs, and plenty of them. Foreign Affairs recently tallied them up:During his 14 years as president, Chávez has launched more than 27 missions, his government's name for social programs. The missions were sold as helping the poor, but no one in government ever worried much about whether the returns justified the investments, or whether the main beneficiaries really were the worst-off.Chavez has helped Venezuela's poor, but his vast stores of money seem to be reaching their limits. As the New York Times points out, \"He has given away tens of thousands of homes, but the rush to build meant that many were plagued by construction flaws or other problems. He has used price controls to make food affordable for the poor, but that has contributed to shortages in basic goods. He created a popular program of neighborhood clinics often staffed by Cuban doctors, but hospitals frequently lack basic equipment.\"Over time, these \"missions\" have amounted to billions in spending, and during election season, Chavez both piled on the money and threatened the programs' disappearance should he lose.The programs' substantial social benefits have also earned Chavez praise from international bodies, even those who otherwise criticize Venezuela for human rights infringement and high rates of violence:\"In terms of economic, social, and cultural rights, the IACHR recognizes the State's achievements with regard to the progressive observance of these rights, including, most notably, the eradication of illiteracy, the reduction of poverty, and the increase in access by the most vulnerable sectors to basic services such as health care,\" the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights wrote in 2010.“Venezuela loves Chávez with guts, heart and mind,” Ramona Caño, a Chavez supporter, told the Economist in September. Venezuela blogger Francisco Toro drew a comparison to a blissful marriage in which the husband pampers his wife while covering up household financial information, much as Toro believes Chavez has hidden the size and expenditures of his oil-revenue-filled secret state funds.In the story, Populus, or the public, is the wife, and Hugo is -- well, you guessed it:Over the years, Populus has grown accustomed to a certain lifestyle, and Hugo has made all kinds of promises that that lifestyle is built on solid rock. Populus knows Hugo had a run of good luck in recent years: he made a big windfall from his backyard mining business. But since Hugo won’t show her the statements for his savings account, she has no way of knowing how much of the windfall he saved, how much he has since spent, or how much is left on hand. Hugo likes to brag about the lovely gifts he’s bought her with the savings from that Fonden savings account, but when Populus asks to see the statements he just clams up, flat out refuses her requests. In fairness to Hugo, she doesn’t ask very often. As long as her lifestyle is sustained, she’s happy to not know. Sure, there are some signs that things may not be all that rosy. Those credit card statements are coming back fatter and fatter each month. Insofar as Populus worries about that, which isn’t actually very far at all, she’s puzzled. She knows he pays 12% interest on that credit card debt, and only gets 2 or 3% interest on his savings out of Fonden Bank. But, again, she doesn’t ask too many questions; she’s minded to trust him. And why shouldn't she? Life is great! They have this thing they do in their family where every six-years they renew their vows and boy, Hugo really makes it rain at those times. Some of Populus’s curmudgeonly uncles, though, can’t help but question her: is their lifestyle really sustainable?Now, Venezuela is left with high debt, skyrocketing inflation and a fiscal and trade deficit, a situation either Chavez or whoever succeeds him will eventually have to fix.If Chavez doesn't recover and assume a fourth term, there's no assurance that the popular programs that kept him in office will survive without him. Vice President Nicolas Maduro would likely succeed him.\"Chavez presumably selected Maduro as his vice president because he was confident that the former bus driver would continue his Bolivarian revolution,\" James Lindsay, of the Council on Foreign Relations, writes. \"Maduro may turn out to be a loyal lieutenant. But history offers up many examples of proteges who abandoned their mentor’s course or lacked the political skills to remain in power.\"</td>\n",

       "      <td>A VENEZUELAN government statement Thursday said that President Hugo Chavez, who has been secreted inside a Cuban hospital since undergoing surgery on Dec. 11, was facing “complications” from “a severe lung infection.” As has been the case throughout his nearly two-year bout with cancer, details of the strongman’s condition, treatment and prognosis are unavailable. But Venezuelans are bracing themselves for the death of the caudillo who has ruled them — and wrecked their once-prosperous country — over the past 13 years. The United States and its Latin American allies need to prepare, as well.Mr. Chavez’s critical condition arrived at a critical moment: He is due to be sworn in next Thursday for another six-year term in office. Having won reelection in October after assuring Venezuelans that he was fully cured, the president disappeared soon afterward; in his last appearance before departing for Cuba, he appointed foreign minister Nicolas Maduro as his vice president and political successor. If Mr. Chavez is too ill to attend his inauguration, authorities are saying, they will simply delay it — a stretch of the constitution’s ambiguous wording. But when and if he dies, the constitution is clear: A new election for president should be held within 30 days.That will be a critical test of Venezuela’s post-Chavez direction. The ruler’s inner circle, which has been gathering around him in Cuba, may consider postponing the election or even calling it off. Their fear — and that of the Castro regime in Cuba — is that a fair vote would be won by opposition leader Henrique Capriles, who lost the October presidential ballot but is more popular than Mr. Maduro. Mr. Maduro is Cuba’s candidate, the successor most likely to ensure continued deliveries of the heavily subsidized Venezuelan oil that is keeping the Communist regime afloat.That’s why the first responsibility of the United States and Venezuelan neighbors such as Brazil should be to insist that the presidential election be held and that it be free and fair. The State Department rightly made that demand public on Thursday, following recent private contacts between officials of the two governments. The administration should be prepared to respond quickly if Mr. Chavez’s followers or military leaders — some of whom are under U.S. sanction for drug trafficking — attempt a coup.Whoever succeeds Mr. Chavez will face a catastrophic economic situation. To win reelection, Mr. Chavez spent wildly last year, increasing the budget deficit to 20 percent of gross domestic product; his successor will be forced to order a sharp and painful devaluation. That will only worsen already high inflation and shortages of staple foods. When poor Venezuelans realize that lavish pre-election promises of new apartments and appliances won’t be delivered, anger toward the new leader may swell.Sadly, the economic pain caused by Mr. Chavez could, after his death, help create a political movement that will revere his memory. Forty years after the death of Juan Peron, Peronism still haunts and holds back Argentina. If Venezuela is to escape a similar curse, Mr. Chavez’s successors will have to balance economic stabilization against the need to build a political system where democracy, and not autocratic populism, can thrive.More on this debate:The Post’s View: Hugo Chavez’s legacy: Failing to prepare Venezuela for the next leaderThe Post’s View: Chavez’s days are numberedThe Post’s View: Venezuela on fireThe Post’s View: Venezuela has a new chance</td>\n",

It is not clear whether he will be able to be inaugurated for a fourth term on Jan. 10, and his chosen successor waits in the wings. If Chávez steps down or dies, what will become of Venezuela? Will Chavismo survive? What sorts of social, economic and political issues must the next president confront? Would the nation’s contentious relationship with the United States improve? (New York Times)Iran should be key topic at hearings: “It is to be hoped that the forthcoming Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearings regarding the president’s nominations for secretary of state and secretary of defense produce a wide-ranging debate regarding this country’s role in today’s very unsettled world. The hearings almost certainly will provoke searching questions regarding the strategic wisdom of potential U.S. military action against Iran. Recent Israeli media reports have cited a former member of President Obama’s National Security Council staff predicting a U.S. attack by about midyear,” writes Zbigniew Brzezinski.

       "      <td>WHAT IS the hottest global market so far in 2012? How about socialist Venezuela — where stocks rose 99 percent between Jan. 1 and this week. That might seem like an improbable surge in a country wracked by double-digit inflation, shortages of water, power and staple foods, and a dearth of investment — not to mention one of the world’s highest murder rates. But Venezuela’s markets are being moved by a strange but powerful force: the absence of reliable information about the health of President Hugo Chavez — and the growing speculation that his condition is rapidly deteriorating.According to Russell M. Dallen Jr, a banker who produces a newsletter on Venezuela, a rumor that a prominent journalist had tweeted the news of Mr. Chavez’s death caused Venezuelan bond prices to spike by as much as 5 percent Friday. The rumor was false, and Mr. Chavez proved he was alive with a phone call to state television on Monday from Cuba. Yet it is Mr. Chavez who has created the feverish climate, by refusing to tell his people the truth about the cancer he has been battling, even as he insists he will be a candidate for a new six-year presidential term in elections scheduled for October.What Venezuelans know is that Mr. Chavez has had three operations in Cuba since the discovery of what he described as a “baseball-size” tumor in his pelvic area last June, including one on Feb.?26 to remove a new growth. He has had three rounds of chemotherapy and three rounds of radiation treatment, also in Cuba. What the country has not been told is what type of cancer the president suffers from or his prognosis — though Mr. Chavez’s tearful prayers at a pre-Easter service on April 5, in which he pleaded for his life, offered an ominous hint.In the vacuum created by the regime, speculation and reports based on unnamed sources are flourishing. The journalist who was the subject of last week’s rumor, Nelson Bocaranda, has reported that the cancer has spread to other organs and that treatment has been ineffective. That has helped propel Venezuelan markets, which are hoping for an end to Mr. Chavez’s disastrous mismanagement of the country. There is a good alternative: a well-organized opposition has nominated a popular state governor, Henrique Capriles Radonski, to compete in the presidential election; he has promised to rebuild democratic institutions.Yet Venezuela is threatened with much worse outcomes. Mr. Bocaranda reported last week that Venezuelan and Cuban generals met in Cuba to decide on what to do if Mr. Chavez is unable to remain in office or compete in the election — and that a military coup was one option under discussion. Though unconfirmed, that all-too-plausible possibility underlines the urgency for Venezuela’s neighbors — and an inert Obama administration — to focus on the possibility that the country may be headed for a political breakdown and to do what they can to prevent it. As a start, they should encourage Mr. Chavez to disclose his condition.Read more on this issue:Yoani Sanchez: Hugo Chavez’s secret illnessThe Post’s View: Venezuela’s new chanceJackson Diehl: Chavez faces an uprising at the ballot box</td>\n",

       "      <td>The Snowden affair is just the kind of high-wire, global crisis that the bombastic late president of Venezuela, Hugo Chavez, would have loved.The cast of actors in the drama would be perfect for the anti-imperialist leader: There’s the young American whistleblower. Chavez’s Venezuela would have cast him as an idealistic, anti-imperialist truth teller. There are juicy American secrets and furious U.S. officials. There are big countries – Russia and China, both Venezuelan allies – jousting with the colossus Chavez simply called “The Empire,” the United States.Chavez, of course, is gone: felled by cancer in March. But no matter. His successor, Nicolas Maduro, is doing his best to make hay of the Snowden affair at the expense of the Obama administration.In fact, with Maduro and a large Venezuelan delegation in Moscow on Tuesday for an energy conference, many observers of the Snowden affair were taking bets that the former National Security Agency contractor might find his way back to Caracas on the official Venezuelan presidential plane. Maduro did little to dampen such speculation.The Venezuelan leader, who just last week said it was “almost certain” he’d bestow asylum for Snowden, spoke of little else but Snowden’s courage and American malice in one public appearance after another in Moscow.He told reporters early in the day that Snowden is a “young American who has dared to say big truths, that the imperialist elite of the United States want to control the world, that they spy on friends and foes, that they spy on the whole world, that they have created an evil system, halfway Orwellian, that intends to control the communications of the world.”He then said on Venezuelan state television that Snowden “has done humanity a favor.”Then at a theater, attending an event to commemorate Chavez, Maduro said Snowden represented disaffected Americans ready to rise up. “His gesture is a gesture of rebellion of the American youth against those who want to control, the elite from the United States who want to control the world,” Maduro said.The Venezuelan leader, who cut his teeth as a union activist in his youth, said Snowden is now being chased around the world for little reason. “And you have to ask yourself,” Maduro said, “you have a right to ask yourself as a citizen of the world, why do they chase him? How many missiles has Snowden fired against the innocent peoples of the world? Did Snowden plant bombs that killed I don’t know who? What crimes has he committed against humanity?”In interviews, though, Maduro dodged questions about whether Snowden would have a seat on his plane. He didn’t say yes. He didn’t say no.“Those are things that at this moment I can’t respond to,” he told RT, a state-financed TV network in Russia. The interviewer followed up by noting that Maduro had said last Thursday that he would likely give Snowden asylum.“Do you maintain that posture?” Maduro was asked.“Yes, I maintain that posture,” he said. “But I’ll add a new element to that posture: which is, I make a call to the youth of the world: What have you done for Snowden? What have you done for the peace of the world? That’s the question.”There’s a chance, of course, that as Maduro ponders Venezuela’s role in helping Snowden he will consider Venezuela’s relations with the U.S., which are bruised but which State Department diplomats have been trying to resuscitate.Maduro, though, has been a difficult negotiator: While professing to want better relations, he has accused U.S. agents of having caused the cancer that killed Chavez and of stoking protests in his homeland after he barely won the presidency in a disputed election rife with voting irregularities.</td>\n",

       "      <td>ANTICIPATING THE death of Hugo Chavez, the Obama administration began reaching out months ago to his designated successor, Nicolas Maduro, in the hope of bettering U.S.-Venezuelan relations. On Tuesday, that strategy absorbed a body blow: Hours before revealing that Mr. Chavez had died of cancer, Mr. Maduro tried to blame the United States for his illness, and he expelled two U.S. military attaches on charges of “proposing destabilizing plans” to the armed forces.So much for the “reset” with Caracas. The ludicrous and crude propaganda launched by Mr. Maduro was a sign that Mr. Chavez’s successors will be more thuggish and less politically adept than he was — and, if anything, more inclined to scapegoat the United States and Venezuela’s democratic opposition for the horrendous problems the caudillo leaves behind.Those troubles, it should be clear, are staggering, even more so when it is considered that Venezuela, a country of less than 30 million people, collected more than $1 trillion in oil revenue during Mr. Chavez’s 14 years of increasingly autocratic rule. Its inflation is among the highest in the world, power outages are routine and consumers are plagued with shortages of basic goods. The murder rate has more than tripled, making Caracas a more dangerous city than Baghdad. Official corruption is rampant, as is drug trafficking: Seven present or former officials have been designated as narcotics kingpins by the U.S. Treasury.Perhaps most dangerous of all for the motley crew that inherits this legacy, Venezuelans have been grossly and cynically deceived. Mr. Chavez assured them he was healthy when he campaigned for reelection last year, even though he surely knew his illness was terminal. As recently as this month, polls showed that the regime’s propaganda had led a majority of Venezuelans to believe that he would soon resume his duties. The government can no more explain Mr. Chavez’s seemingly sudden demise than it can deliver on the extravagant promises he made in his last months, including a mass giveaway of apartments and appliances.It’s little wonder the United States is being blamed. Since his youth, Mr. Maduro has been a client of the Castro regime in Cuba, which depends on Venezuela for 60 percent of its energy. The Venezuelan transition has been orchestrated from Havana, where Mr. Chavez was secluded from December until two weeks ago; anti-American hysteria is the Castros’ oldest wheeze.The only mystery here is why the Obama administration is focusing its diplomacy on courting Mr. Maduro and his cronies. Venezuela’s constitution says a new presidential election must take place within 30 days, and Mr. Maduro will face a challenge from opposition leader Henrique Capriles, who has twice defeated Chavez lieutenants in gubernatorial elections, most recently in December. Nor is it clear that Mr. Chavez’s followers will unite behind Cuba’s favorite; the Venezuelan military and politicians close to it are said to be resistant to Havana’s tutelage.A sensible U.S. policy in these circumstances would start with insistence on a fair, democratic vote to determine Mr. Chavez’s successor and with the defense of peaceful political actors, such as the Venezuelan students whose protest campground was attacked and burned in the hours after Mr. Chavez’s death. Further wooing of Mr. Maduro should wait until he survives the scrum in his own party, wins a free vote and demonstrates that he is more than a Castro puppet.Read more on this subject:Marie Arana: Hugo Chavez — where Marx met OprahJackson Diehl: Chavez is not going quietly</td>\n",

       "      <td>RIO DE JANEIRO — On every stage where a Latin American leader launched into soaring oratory against the imperialists, Fidel Castro was present.In every lonely jungle hideout where guerrillas in olive-drab plotted their fight, Castro kept them company. In every country where revolutionaries and communists dreamed of creating a workers’ paradise, Castro was a guiding light.No single figure did more to define generations of Latin Americans who sought political upheaval than Castro. His anti-American rants inspired followers in countries that also saw resources sucked away by local elites in cahoots with the mighty United States. In nations with extreme inequality, governments took lessons from his state-run economic model. For modern-day strongmen looking for high-minded justifications to seize control of parliaments, courts and the media, he was the man.These days, many Latin American countries’ political and economic ties with Cuba have weakened because of painful recessions and voters’ rejection of leftist governments. Leftists in Latin America have little interest in armed revolution anymore. Still, Cuba’s influence in the region endures, both because of its advances in education and health care, and because of its example of fierce independence.“Yesterday the greatest of all Latin Americans died,” former Brazilian president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva wrote on his Facebook page Saturday.In the 60 years since Castro and his comrades sailed to Cuba from the coast of Mexico to launch their unlikely rebellion, his story has been an example for leftists in the region who took up arms against their governments.Some, like Castro, transitioned to political leadership and pressed for greater spending on the poor. Dilma Rousseff in Brazil and José Mujica in Uruguay fought against military dictatorships before eventually becoming presidents, while current leaders such as Daniel Ortega in Nicaragua and Salvador Sánchez Cerén in El Salvador were prominent guerrillas in Cold War battles against U.S.-backed regimes.“Dreamers and progressive militants, everyone who fights for social justice and for a less unequal world, we all woke up sad this Saturday,” Rousseff wrote on her blog.Castro’s Cuba provided moral support for small Latin American countries pushing back against institutions such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund that wanted painful austerity measures. When Colombia’s main rebel group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), needed a place to talk peace in recent years with that country’s leaders after a half-century of war, they found it in Cuba. While the “pink tide” of leftist governments that swept across Latin America in the early 2000s has ebbed, with more-conservative leaders taking power in several countries, Castro’s followers and allies are still a force in the region.One can see Castro’s shadow in places such as Evo Morales’s Bolivia and Rafael Correa’s Ecuador. These long-serving South American leaders, who consider Castro an inspiration, have distanced their countries from the United States, overseen constitutional changes that extended their rule, and spent heavily on welfare programs in the name of a “21st-century socialism.”Morales, a former coca grower who rose to prominence opposing U.S.-funded eradication efforts, has described Castro as a “father,” and analysts think the Cuban’s example helped Morales broaden his message beyond the coca fields. On Saturday, Morales choked up as he paid tribute to Castro.“He accompanied us,” Morales said. “He guided us. Fidel oriented us and the Cuban people to raise our voices against those who imposed the politics of domination .?.?. to ransack our natural resources.”While Castro is a symbol across Latin America, few places still try to replicate his Soviet- inspired economic system. One exception is Venezuela, an oil-producing country that instituted its own socialist model after former military officer Hugo Chávez came to power in 1999. When Chávez died in 2013, Castro described him as “the best friend Cuba ever had.”Chávez’s government modeled its health-care and literacy programs on Cuba’s. While Venezuela shipped cheap oil to the island, Cuban doctors and teachers fanned out into poor neighborhoods of Venezuela to teach and provide medical care.“Cuban support was fundamental for developing [these] social programs,” said Nicmer Evans, a Venezuelan political analyst.The Chávez government’s heavy subsidies for such things as milk and corn flour helped poor Venezuelans in times of high oil revenue but are difficult to sustain now that petroleum prices have slumped. The country is suffering extreme shortages of food and medicine, rampant inflation and growing social unrest. Chávez’s successor, Nicolás Maduro, is fighting off an opposition effort to oust him from the presidency.In other parts of Latin America, Castro’s influence has been more symbolic. In Mexico, student activists still wear hats and T-shirts featuring pictures of Cuban revolutionaries. But Castro has generally been seen by Mexican politicians as a convenient friend rather than someone to emulate.Most Latin American countries cut diplomatic ties with Cuba after Castro’s revolution, while Mexico recognized the new regime in the face of stiff U.S. resistance. Mexico, though, was using its diplomatic tools more to gain leverage with the United States than to pursue Cuba-style policies.“There was always this idea in Mexican diplomacy that they supported causes that were against the United States in order to negotiate with the Americans,” said Ilán Semo, a historian at the Ibero-American University in Mexico City.While Cuba helped foment rebellion in other Latin American countries in the 1960s, ’70s and ’80s, Castro resisted doing that in Mexico.Several countries with socialist-inspired leaders, such as Chile’s Michelle Bachelet and Brazil’s Lula and his successor, Rousseff, had good relations with Cuba but pursued more market-friendly economic policies while expanding social programs.While Castro’s economic approach has lost popularity, Latin American countries remember him more for his focus on health care, education and better conditions for the poor.“For the peoples of our continent and the workers of our poorest countries, especially for the men and women of my generation, Fidel was always a voice of struggle and hope,” Lula wrote.Cid Benjamin, a former member of an armed Brazilian leftist group in the 1960s, considers himself part of a generation “formed by the influence of the Cuban revolution.”He now sees Cuba’s health and education systems as Castro’s most important regional legacies.“It has an influence on the whole left,” Benjamin said. For years, Cuba has sent doctors and teachers to provide services in countries such as Venezuela, Brazil and Angola, earning hard currency in the process.Under Rousseff, Brazil brought in 11,000 Cuban doctors to work in gritty suburbs and isolated rural areas, where middle-class Brazilian doctors were often reluctant to practice. It’s a Cuban legacy a generation of poorer Brazilians is unlikely to forget.Partlow reported from Olympia, Wash.

       "      <td>CARACAS, Venezuela — Fighting for his political life, President Hugo Chavez overcame a vigorous challenge by Henrique Capriles in Sunday’s presidential election, receiving another six-year term that will give the populist firebrand the opportunity to complete the consolidation of what he calls 21st century socialism in one of the world’s great oil powers.The victory, announced by the National Electoral Council late Sunday, gave Chavez the win with 54.4 percent of the vote, while Capriles took 44.9 percent. In winning his fourth presidential election since 1998, Chavez captured just over 7.4 million votes to 6.1 million for his adversary, turning back what had been a determined battle by Capriles, a 40-year-old former governor.“I congratulate the opposition and the directors of the opposition, because they recognize the victory of the people,” Chavez told throngs of supporters gathered outside the presidential palace. “That’s why I send them this salute and put out my arms to them, because we are all brothers in the fatherland of Bolivar.”Half an hour later, Capriles conceded at his campaign headquarters. But he signaled that the support of millions of Venezuelans showed that his proposals had struck a chord. And he asked that Chavez, who often mocks his foes as oligarchs and lackeys of U.S. imperialism, take the opposition’s needs into account.“I’m convinced that this country can be better,” Capriles said in a halting, emotional speech. “Being a good president means working for all Venezuelans.”Chavez’s victory touched off wild celebrations in the capital, where crowds of the president’s red-shirted supporters — the “Chavistas” from the poorest barrios who have been the backbone of his movement — set off fireworks and blew horns.“You can’t do better than this president,” said Miguel Guevara, 77, who sells books in the streets and voted in a poor barrio whose support helped bring Chavez to power. “The only one who has helped the country is named Hugo Chavez.”The president of the electoral council, Tibisay Lucena, said more than 80 percent of the country’s nearly 19 million registered voters participated in the election.“To the participants who didn’t get victory, consider yourselves victors, too,” she said in making her announcement to loud cheers among Chavez’s supporters. “To participate in an electoral process like this one, in democracy, is a victory for the whole people of Venezuela. The entire country has won.”Chavez still faces a host of challenges that were highlighted by Capriles’s focused, well-organized campaign, in which the youthful lawyer — known as “Skinny” to his followers — hammered the government daily for the country’s decaying infrastructure, increasing dependence on oil exports and inability to control one of the world’s highest homicide rates.A largely forgotten topic in recent months that may again become a major issue is the tumor in Chavez’s pelvic region that he has said was removed this year. Although he announced that he was cured after months of chemotherapy and radiation therapy, details about his health remain a state secret.The president was clearly slowed by the cancer during the campaign, which served to highlight Capriles’s vigor. The man known as El Comandante to his followers appeared bloated, had to walk gingerly and could no longer speak to crowds for hours at a time, as had been his custom.Carlos Romero, a political analyst here who has closely tracked the election, said that despite Chavez’s victory, his economic model of state interventions has failed. That failure, Romero said, coupled with Chavez’s questionable health, meant that this is likely to be the last major win for the president.“What I am clear about is that this is the last victory for Chavez,” said Romero, who had predicted Chavez’s victory in the election. “The cycle is closing.”After coming to prominence in the 1990s after a failed attempt to seize power, Chavez, a former army paratrooper, won a series of elections: referendums that led to a new constitution and ended term limits and a vote that turned back a recall referendum in 2004.But Chavez lost a 2007 referendum that would have given him a raft of new powers, and the opposition won more votes in elections staged in 2010 for lawmakers in the country’s National Assembly.Venezuelans flooded polling stations Sunday, each side determined to choose between two starkly different candidates: one who offers a powerful state that nationalizes companies and spends freely on social programs with petrodollars and another who offered a more business-friendly government that would rebuild tattered relations with the United States.“It’s not only about a president but about a whole political system — socialism or democratic, so it’s very important for us,” said David Fermin, 44, an economist who voted in a leafy upper-class neighborhood that was supportive of Capriles.The president’s campaign, though, was disciplined and loyal, and well before dawn bugles sounded in the poor barrios that have come out for him in force many times. That got voters to the polls, where lines started to form before 5 a.m. for openings an hour later.For those most fervent of followers, Chavez has been a leader like no other — he has spent heavily, using billions of dollars under his control to start small-scale social programs that provide everything from cheap food to basic medical care in the tumbledown barrios that carpet the hills of this and other cities.Lilian Gonzalez, 60, who takes care of children, praised Chavez and said that the run-up to the election had been anguishing for her because she feared that the president would be defeated and that the country would “go back to the past.”“Here, the poorest people now have meals three times a day,” she said, explaining one reason why she supported Chavez.Chavez has long used his oratorical gifts and the oil money he controls through his office to cast himself as a father figure to the poor, creating a near-religious connection with his followers, one that has never been easy for the opposition to break.In the campaign, he heaped scorn on Capriles, calling him everything from a “fascist” to a “mediocre bootlicker.”“Who’s going to debate with you?” Chavez said in one recent speech, after Capriles challenged him to a debate. “Learn how to talk first.”He argued that Capriles would represent the interests of the United States, not the poor, and that his government would slash popular social programs, a claim that Capriles had to repeatedly deny.The attacks had an impact.Javier Alejandro Piñango, 33, a delivery driver, said he didn’t trust Capriles, arguing that the contender had tried to fashion himself as a populist like Chavez.“The other candidate has no proposal, he has no spark,” Piñango said as he cast his ballot in a poor neighborhood. “That is what I like about El Comandante and what he has done. He has changed things and has also awakened us. And the country is better.”Capriles, noting the government’s heavy spending on the campaign and its overwhelming control of the airwaves, compared himself frequently to David and Chavez to Goliath. “David won over Goliath because he was not afraid,” Capriles told reporters recently. “The Venezuelan people are not afraid.”But the argument did not sway Tailde Salazar, 45, a teacher who had been trained through a government program in the slum where she lives.“Our hope, our leftist movement is in place with this revolution,” she said.</td>\n",

       "      <td>VenezuelaNew treatment for Chavez, official saysAiling Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez has been undergoing “tougher” new treatment for cancer, including chemotherapy, at the military hospital where he has been for the past two weeks, his vice president said.Speaking in Caracas after a Catholic Mass to pray for Chavez’s health, Nicolas Maduro described how the socialist president had personally given the order to leave Cuba in mid-February, two months after his latest cancer surgery there.“He said, ‘I’ve taken the decision to return to Venezuela. I’m going to enter a new phase of complementary treatments, tougher and more intense. I want to be in Caracas,’?” Maduro said Friday.Apart from one set of photos showing Chavez in a Havana hospital bed, he has not been seen or heard from in public since the Dec. 11 surgery in Cuba, his fourth operation since the disease was detected in mid-2011. Chavez had previous rounds of chemo- and radiotherapy, which at times left him bald and bloated. He twice wrongly declared himself cured.Furious about rumors swirling all week that Chavez may have died, Maduro said the new treatment was possible only because the president’s condition had actually improved in January.— ReutersZimbabweMugabe celebrates 89th birthdayZimbabwean President Robert Mugabe, celebrating his 89th birthday, says he believes he will defeat his opponents in elections this year and remain in power at least another five years.Mugabe cut a 40-pound cake Saturday in a sports arena in Bindura. His party’s youth groups said they walked to the bash to celebrate his “walk through a life of struggle against colonialism and Western imperialism.”Mugabe, who came to power in 1987, said he was confident his ZANU-PF party will triumph at the polls and accused his rivals of claiming there’s been a recent increase in political violence so as to blame their upcoming election defeat on unfair polls.— Associated PressUnited NationsU.N. may lift Somalia arms embargoThe U.N. Security Council is considering lifting an arms embargo on Somalia’s government for one year so it can beef up its army to combat Islamist fighters, according to a draft resolution.The Somali government has asked for the arms embargo to be lifted, and the United States has been pushing the council to agree. But Britain and France have been wary of removing the ban in a country already awash with weapons, diplomats say.The draft resolution, drawn up by Britain and obtained by Reuters, appears to propose a compromise: lifting the arms embargo for one year but keeping restrictions in place on heavy weapons such as surface-to-air missiles, howitzers and cannons. The council is expected to vote on the draft Wednesday.The 15-member council imposed the embargo in 1992 to cut the flow of arms to feuding warlords, who a year earlier ousted dictator Mohamed Siad Barre, plunging Somalia into civil war.— ReutersDeveloper ready to demolish Berlin Wall: A property developer behind plans to demolish a remnant of the Berlin Wall to make way for luxury apartments said Saturday that he would carry through with the action despite protests. “On Monday, the work continues,” Maik Uwe Hinkel told Berlin newspaper BZ. “We have the permission and think the building is good for Berlin.” On Friday, protesters at the East Side Gallery, a nearly 1-mile stretch of the Berlin Wall, prevented a crane from removing a section. The major tourist spot features some 120 paintings by international artists. Hinkel, of the Living Bauhaus investment group, said that the demolition would provide an access road to the apartments and allow for the rebuilding of a pedestrian bridge destroyed in World War II. Protesters plan to gather on Sunday at 2 p.m. at that stretch of the Wall, but observers say it’s unlikely the project can be permanently blocked.Colleagues defend hot air balloon pilot: Hot air balloon pilots in Luxor, Egypt, are defending their colleague who survived Tuesday’s crash that killed 19 tourists. Initial reports say the balloon was trying to land when a cable got caught around a gas tube and a fire erupted. Pilots who know the Egyptian pilot, Momin Murad, said in a press conference Saturday that Murad has an eight-year track record of flying balloons without incident. Murad, who suffered severe burns, and a British tourist were the only survivors. The pilots also defended Egypt’s safety measures for the tourist activity, saying the company that operated the balloon that crashed had canceled trips the day before due to bad weather.From wire reports</td>\n",

       "      <td>CARACAS, Venezuela — Hugo Chavez’s fervent followers still assemble in the capital’s main public square, decked in the bright red of their leader’s movement, to chant revolutionary songs that envisage the president leading the country far into the future.But Chavez, who has dominated public life here since the late 1990s, is nowhere to be seen. He no longer gives his trademark bombastic speeches, nor does he hold forth on television like a game-show host. On Sunday, he remained in Cuba, where he has been for nearly a month, presumably convalescing after undergoing surgery to remove what he called “some malignant cells” in his pelvic region, from which doctors have struggled to extricate a cancerous tumor.To Venezuelans, it is becoming clear that Chavez may well not return by Thursday, a key day in the political calendar. The 58-year-old former paratrooper is supposed to be inaugurated that day for a fourth term that would extend his presidency until 2019.Opposition leaders say that would leave a power vacuum that by law should shift authority to an interim leader of the leftist government and trigger fresh elections, a scenario that could end the socialist government that has transformed one of the world’s great oil powers. That is unlikely to happen, however, with the president’s top aides sending strong signals over the weekend that they were scrambling to postpone the inauguration.“I am clear that the president may not be able to take the oath in five days because of his condition, but what’s the problem?” said Javier Ramirez, 54, who works on ideological training in Chavez’s Socialist party and joined the crowds over the weekend at Bolivar Plaza. “If El Comandante cannot be here, we will be the commander. We will be Chavez.”Indeed, Vice President Nicolas Maduro, whom Chavez has said would succeed him if he is unable to return to power, and National Assembly President Diosdado Cabello have gone to great lengths to display a united front, one completely opposed to any interpretation of the constitution that would shift power away from the president.In a sense, that has helped create an air of serenity.But some here say it feels like the calm before the storm that would descend on this country of 29 million should Chavez fail to return to power, as the president himself publicly contemplated before flying to Havana on Dec. 10.“It is a crisis situation that you have an elected leader on his death bed,” said David Smilde, a University of Georgia expert on Venezuelan politics and co-editor of “Venezuela’s Bolivarian Democracy: Participation, Politics, and Culture Under Chavez.”“Chavez is very clearly near the end. You can imagine him recovering, but it appears he is on his death bed.”Since Chavez first announced he had undergone cancer surgeries in June 2011, his condition has been largely cloaked in secrecy. There have been four operations, but he has not said what kind of cancer he has, exactly where it is located or what the prognosis is.Chavez’s aides have only added to the uncertainty over the past month.A day after Chavez’s Dec. 11 operation, Information Minister Ernesto Villegas said on a government Web site that Chavez might not be back for the swearing-in. Then on Christmas Eve, Maduro, the vice president, told state television he had spoken with Chavez by phone and that he was up and walking.By New Year’s Eve, Chavez was suffering from “new complications,” Maduro said in a televised address. Then on Thursday, Villegas said Chavez had a “severe” respiratory infection.“We are always informing, with the truth,” Maduro said in a carefully choreographed interview on state television Friday.But opposition leaders said the government is probably shielding unpleasant details of Chavez’s health, leaving some Venezuelans to conclude that the president may be on life support, or worse.“Trying to make the country believe that the president is governing is absurd to the point of being irresponsible,” Ramon Guillermo Aveledo, head of the Democratic Unity coalition of Chavez opponents, said at a news conference last week.The government’s adversaries say that a commission should be sent to Cuba to determine whether Chavez is fit to remain president.They note that the constitution directs that if the president dies or is too ill to govern, then a new election must be held within 30 days.The constitution says the inauguration of a president should take place on Jan. 10 before the National Assembly. It also says that if the swearing-in cannot take place before the assembly, then it should take place before the Supreme Court.Maduro and Cabello have seized on that second clause to say that the constitution permits the inauguration to be postponed.“Get this into your heads: Hugo Chavez was elected president, and he will continue to be president beyond Jan. 10,” Cabello said Saturday, directing his words to opponents. “You should have no doubt about that.”Maria Corina Machado, an opposition member of the National Assembly, said it has become clear the inauguration is considered by the government’s ruling circle to be a mere formality.“Never in 200 years of our history has the destiny of the country been decided outside of the country,” she said. “What they want is to let January 10th pass like it’s any other day, that it is simply a formality because Chavez was reelected.”For the president’s most zealous followers, though, such criticisms amount to a concerted effort to destabilize the government.“I’m a revolutionary, and from here, my commander, I’ll be in charge,” said Jazmin Fuentes, 56, taking a break from chanting leftist songs in support of Chavez.“I love him, and from here in Bolivar Plaza I send him a revolutionary greeting, with love, to say that the people are standing with you, my commander.”</td>\n",

       "      <td>CARACAS, Venezuela — For more than three hours, he towered before the crowds in the city center — bombastic, fierce, funny, singing songs and promising that rigid socialism would upend the American-style capitalism he abhors.But despite the brief appearance Monday of the president of old, Hugo Chavez’s weeks of ruling via Twitter while recovering from his latest cancer surgery have left even some supporters wondering whether he will live through another six-year term.The fiery leader who survived a coup attempt a decade ago is facing a threat that could end Latin America’s most radical populist movement and remove an antagonist of the United States who has built close ties with Syria, Iran and other despotic governments. His departure could also weaken Cuba, the region’s only communist state, which is led by a gerontocracy heavily dependent on subsidized Venezuelan oil.“We see him, and we know he is sick,” said Evelyn Quevedo, a teacher who, at 57, is the same age as the president. “Something is happening to the president, because if it weren’t that way, he would be on television every day. This is not his style.”A year after Cuban doctors worked to remove a cancerous growth in a complicated surgery, a president who has run his country like a game-show host is rarely on the air and reveals only sketchy details about his condition. Chavez’s Sunday television program, “Hello, Mr. President,” has been suspended for much of the year, and so have once- ubiquitous state tours of destinations as far away as Tehran that had been a staple of the state media apparatus.In their place are smaller but intricately staged events: a brief meeting with officials from Belarus, a halting walk through the presidential palace, cameras panning Chavez head to toe to assure viewers that he is still here and moving without assistance. There are calls from El Comandante to state television programs, and his ministers have taken to reading his tweets at rallies, with the president frequently issuing 140-character missives that substitute for his usual proclamations.Chavez, though, says the swirling speculation about his health is the work of a diabolical counterrevolution intent on ousting him.“They say that I cannot walk, that I walk with two walking sticks, that I have a wheelchair,” Chavez said Monday in a packed square in central Caracas. “Soon, we’ll be playing baseball.”His jowls and body looked swollen, and he walked gingerly, but Chavez used his potent oratory skills and his cultlike status among his followers to try to erase doubts about his health.He told the sea of fervent red-shirted followers: “Here I am, once more in front of you and, in your name and the name of the fatherland, registering as candidate for president.”Such pronouncements — affirmations that the end is far from near — are consumed like gospel by his closest associates, who reveal nothing more about an illness considered a state secret. Chavez, who is the only one authorized to speak publicly about his cancer, has revealed that he has had three operations, as well as chemotherapy and radiation therapy.Asked whether Chavez could be sidelined by the recurring tumor, his campaign organizer, Jorge Rodriguez, quickly tried to dampen any hint that the president could be forced out of his race against a 39-year-old challenger, Henrique Capriles.“Absolutely not,” Rodriguez, who maintained a tense smile, said in an interview last week. “If you like, we’ll see each other on October 8 in the morning, and I’ll confirm what I’m saying now: Chavez is going to give the candidate of the right a tremendous beating.”Oncologists who have been tracking Chavez’s health — and are familiar with the kind of treatments he describes — say he may be suffering from an aggressive tumor, possibly a sarcoma, that is resistant to chemotherapy.“What that indicates to us is that the cancer has a relapse and that that cancer is very likely not a curable cancer,” said Julian Molina, an oncologist at the Mayo Clinic. “For these types of cancers, you know, the best chance is the first chance. That is when you have the best option to cure.”‘Chavez transcends life’Little by little, in a way that is increasingly felt across Venezuela, there are signs that inside Chavismo — the powerful populist movement named after Chavez — some are beginning to at least raise the possibility of a Venezuela without Chavez.In the Popular Tribune, the Communist Party’s newspaper, a recent column said Chavez’s condition “puts over the carpet — like it or not” — the possibility of his demise and how that would negatively affect Venezuela’s socialist transformation.And in a meeting of Chavez’s campaign committee in late April, Wilmar Castro, who heads the planning commission for the campaign, openly spoke of the need to consider electoral scenarios. One included a campaign without Chavez as the ruling party’s candidate.“The president has cancer,” Castro told other regional campaign chiefs. “It’s not just anything.”Loyal allies such as Ramses Reyes, a former congressman and head of a leftist movement called Venezuelan Revolutionary Currents, said it has been hard to imagine a political arena absent Chavez.“We could never fathom that this man of steel could be a human with defects, with the possibility of getting ill,” Reyes said. But Chavez’s followers, he said, now also believe that there is more to Chavez than his “physical presence,” that his philosophy would live on and keep his supporters united long after his departure.“It could be that the man is replaced, but not the Chavez philosophy,” Reyes said. “What I mean is Chavez transcends life. Chavez is the symbol of the revolutionary process.”Foreseeing a rocky transitionLately, the talk of who would replace Chavez — if failing health forces him out before October or after the election should he win — has become a central issue in Venezuelan public life. Chavez’s having been such a powerful and omnipresent leader, with moderates having left government or been forced from service, makes for the likelihood of a rocky transition.“If Chavez is not in a condition to be president, the leadership in his party is not well defined,” said Miguel Otero, editor of El Nacional, a Caracas newspaper that has aggressively explored the machinations inside Chavez’s movement. “It is not like Cuba, where Fidel has his brother. In North Korea, there is the son. Here there is no leader who can substitute for him.”Analysts here say that if illness forces Chavez out before the election, the United Socialist Party would pick another candidate. If Chavez dies in the first four years of a second term, new elections would be called.Those with political power include Adan Chavez, the president’s older brother, who introduced him to radical political thought and is close to Cuba’s leadership. There is also Vice President Elias Jaua, who cut his teeth at university protests, and Foreign Minister Nicolas Maduro, a former bus driver and union organizer.Another loyalist is Diosdado Cabello, a tough former military man who joined Chavez, then an officer in the Venezuelan army, in an ill-fated coup attempt in 1992.Marbella Pineda, 46, a die-hard Chavez follower who wore the movement’s red shirt at Monday’s rally, called those men “serious, focused and having all the support of the people.”But when asked whether any could really replace Chavez, she let out a nervous laugh and said, “Not any of them.”More world news coverage:- Clinton accuses Russia of selling attack helicopters to Syria- A Russian reformer, felled by graft- Burmese refugees in limbo- Read more headlines from around the world</td>\n",

       "      <td>Venezuela bid farewell to President Hugo Chavez in an emotional funeral on Friday and then hours later inaugurated a new president, Nicolas Maduro, who pledges to continue the late leader’s radical economic and political transformation of one of the world’s great oil powers.“I, Nicolas Maduro, militant in Chavez’s cause, assume his sash as the legitimate president, to lift the people, protect them and to follow the path of continuing the revolution,” the former vice president, 50, said after the presidential sash was placed over his shoulder upon taking the oath of office.In keeping with the day’s tone of reverence for El Comandante, Maduro cried when speaking of him and eulogized him as a Christ-like savior who had delivered Venezuela from darkness in 14 years of rule. He didn’t shy away from acknowledging the challenges he faced and stressed that he was thrust into his new role without wanting it.“This sash belongs to Hugo Chavez, our commander in chief,” Maduro said, his voice cracking before a packed congressional hall.The tributes began hours before at the funeral, as left-wing celebrities and heads of state from as far away as Iran filed into a hall in this city’s military academy to hear Chavez celebrated for having countered American influence while giving voice to the poor.“Here you are, unconquered, pure, transparent, unique, true and alive for all times,” Maduro said loudly, nearly breaking down in tears, as many in attendance gasped with grief. “Comandante, they couldn’t bring you down and they will never be able to defeat us, ever.”The government’s glorification of Chavez will extend long beyond the funeral: Chavez’s body is to be preserved and put on display for eternity in a glass coffin, a decision that delighted many of his red-shirted followers.“They will build a mausoleum so we can see him eternally,” said Jose Antonio Muñoz, 62, who was excited at the prospect of visiting the late president whenever he wanted. “That’s the first time that happens in Latin America!”Political analysts said the elaborate ceremony put on by the government and the initiative to display Chavez’s body in perpetuity would help instill in people the idea that they must follow the president’s grand designs for Venezuela, which include heavy state intervention in the economy and leading like-minded countries in opposing American foreign policy.The central beneficiary will be Maduro, whom Chavez handpicked as his successor in his last public speech, on Dec. 8. Maduro will face a presidential campaign in the weeks ahead as mandated by the constitution upon the death of the head of state.“There is an order from Chavez,” said Rafael Romero, a political scientist at the Central University of Venezuela.“Without a doubt, all these manifestations contribute,” Romero said of the deification of Chavez. “It’s a way of saying, ‘We can’t betray him, because we’re talking about continuing his legacy.’?”After being largely silent in the three days since Chavez’s death on Tuesday at age 58, the opposition on Friday rejected a controversial Supreme Court ruling made earlier in the day that declared that Maduro had become acting president when Chavez died. The ruling opens the door for Maduro to be the government’s candidate in an election because the constitution bars sitting vice presidents from running for president.“We are not going to permit that the pain that our people genuinely feel be an excuse for the abuse of power,” said Henrique Capriles, the 40-year-old governor who would likely be the opposition’s candidate.Capriles’s criticism, though, was overshadowed by the pomp that surrounded the send-off for Chavez. The funeral was staged at the same military academy where he had been a cadet decades earlier.Some Venezuelans said the ceremony was befitting of a monarch, with actors like Sean Penn arriving to mourn alongside the presidents of more than 30 countries. The dignitaries included close friends from the region, among them the presidents of Bolivia and Ecuador, and also allies from around the world, such as President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran.The United States, which Maduro earlier this week implied had taken part in a plot to infect Chavez with cancer that killed him, sent an understated delegation that included Rep. Gregory W. Meeks (D-N.Y.) and former Massachusetts congressman William Delahunt (D). The United States does not have an ambassador based in Venezuela, the last one having been ousted by Chavez during one of the frequent spats he had with Washington.Another American who was invited, the Rev. Jesse L. Jackson, led a prayer in which he called on God to help “heal the breach” between Venezuela and the Obama administration.State television provided continuous coverage, with the hosts gushing about Chavez’s legacy, saying that he not only improved the lives of Venezuelans but also forged “a multi- polar” world that challenged American supremacy.“It’s unbelievable, it’s historic — imagine being out there to hear the people say, ‘All of us are Chavez,’?” said one host. “That’s how it is. Chavez has given us a legacy — political, historic, cultural, economic.”To be sure, those who make up Chavez’s political base, many of whom are urban poor, flocked to the academy during the past three days to get in line for the chance to say goodbye to their leader.“It’s not the way you want to see him, but it was good, and I felt a good energy in that moment when I went in there,” said Kelly Garcia, 27. But she added that “he will not be replaced because no one can replace him.”Many said they would take Chavez’s words to heart — and continue to support his self-styled revolution and Maduro.“He did so much for us, and as long as we Venezuelans keep that in mind, then everything that he did hasn’t died,” said Maria Andrade, 54. “Now is the time when we need to keep in mind the values Hugo Chavez gave us.”Emilia Diaz contributed to this report.</td>\n",

       "      <td>CARACAS, Venezuela — The death of President Hugo Chavez on Tuesday after a long fight against cancer led to an outpouring of grief from the poor masses as the country braced for an expected election to determine the future of the socialist system he established in the oil-rich nation.In a brief, somber announcement televised nationally, Vice President Nicolas Maduro, crying while he spoke, said he had “hard and tragic” information — that Chavez had died at 4:25 p.m. The 58-year-old leader had ruled Venezuela for 14 years, becoming a savior to millions but seen as a despot by opponents.The government did not say what caused Chavez’s death, having never revealed what kind of cancer he had been battling since it was detected in June 2011. But the president had been suffering from a severe infection and serious respiratory problems, Maduro had said in an earlier announcement Tuesday when Chavez was still believed to have been alive.News of El Comandante’s death led some of his followers to pour into the streets of Venezuela, which the populist leftist had turned into a socialist state modeled partly on the Cuban regime that he revered.“He was like my father. He had a soul that was very big, and we are very sad,” said Nancy del Nogal, 58, a worker in the state oil company, which Chavez purged of opponents. “He didn’t deserve it. We deserved it more than him. He fought for this country, and we’ll follow him and continue in this battle. Let that be clear to the world. We’ll fight for what he fought for here.”Chavez, though, also deeply divided this country of 29 million.He was able to take control of the courts, the congress and all other institutions, while forcing some of his toughest opponents into exile.He called his critics part of a “corrupt elite” that wanted to sack Venezuela, though polls showed that nearly 50 percent of voters opposed his rule. He also became Latin America’s leading anti-U.S. leader, accusing the United States of plotting incessantly to topple his government.Even on the day of his death, in a speech filled with accusations against the United States, Chavez’s closest associate, Maduro, had announced that there “is no doubt” that the country’s “historic enemies” had found a way to infect him with cancer.After his death was announced, President Obama said in a statement that “the United States reaffirms its support for the Venezuelan people and its interest in developing a constructive relationship with the Venezuelan government.”Under the constitution, Chavez’s death should trigger a presidential election to replace him within a month. Foreign Minister Elias Jaua said in a television interview Tuesday that Maduro will be the interim president until the election.Although no one spoke of a campaign as Venezuelans tried to get a grip on the news, Chavez told his followers in a Dec. 8 televised address that his successor should be Maduro, a former bus driver and union leader with close links to Cuba’s leadership. The opposing candidate, political analysts say, would probably be Henrique Capriles, 40, a governor who lost to Chavez in an Oct. 7 presidential election by more than 10 points but has energized the opposition.Many analysts say the opposition will have an uphill battle to win the presidency, with the sympathy votes playing in Maduro’s favor. The state’s heavy spending during election time, which includes handing out homes to voters, has also created believers who vote for Chavez’s self-styled revolutionary government.“Chavistas,” those who are part of the former president’s movement, said they would ensure that his followers’ government retains power.“The fight continues,” said Mari Pielo Garcia, 42, a hotel worker. “Chavez lives. Wherever they call on us, we’ll be there.”George Ciccariello-Maher, a professor at Drexel University and author of the book “We Created Chavez: A People’s History of the Venezuelan Revolution,” said that “there is no reason to believe that Maduro would lose, given both the popularity of the revolution but also the weakness of the opposition.”“And any government — right or left — will need to take seriously popular demands to continue, and even radicalize, the revolution,” Ciccariello-Maher said.A leading opposition figure said she hopes that Venezuelans will come together now to form a country free of the angry divisions that marked the past 14 years. “A chapter has closed for Venezuela,” said Maria Corina Machado, a congresswoman. “We should take profound lessons from all of this.”Venezuela had been in a state of tension for weeks after Chavez flew to Cuba on Dec. 10 for his fourth and most complicated of four cancer surgeries, which took place the following day.He was never seen publicly again, with only four photos of him issued, showing him lying in a bed in February flanked by two of his daughters. Chavez returned to Venezuela on Feb. 18, spirited into Caracas in a pre-dawn flight, out of the sight of cameras or well-wishers. He was taken to the hospital where he would spend the rest of his days.His poor state of health kept him from showing up to his Jan. 10 inauguration for a fourth term, prompting many Venezuelans to question whether the constitution was not being violated. Maduro and other ministers appeared to be running the day-to-day affairs of state, though their leader had not taken the oath of office.The absence of Chavez from Venezuela’s daily life was an astonishing shift in a country where all things political had revolved around a man who loved the limelight — a loquacious and bombastic leader known to give speeches lasting up to 10 hours. Indeed, an entire state media apparatus — with six television stations, a number of newspapers and dozens of community radio stations — was built to amplify his message.Forero reported from Charleston, W.Va.</td>\n",

       "      <td>IN 13 YEARS of ruling Venezuela, Hugo Chavez has often benefited from his opposition. His first election victory reflected disgust with a complacent and corrupt political order; in his early years, the remnants of that elite played into his hands by boycotting elections while trying to oust him through non-democratic means. In the last presidential election, in 2006, Mr. Chavez faced a respectable but uncharismatic opponent with a history in the old order. He won handily, then forced challenger Manuel Rosales into exile.Six years later Mr. Chavez’s Venezuela is a wretched mess of inflation, food shortages, rampant drug trafficking and one of the world’s highest murder rates. Yet in the opposition, a promising new political generation has emerged whose leaders look a lot like their counterparts in Brazil, Chile or Mexico. They are populist but pragmatic; internationally schooled yet focused on the problems of the poor; and committed to peaceful change. With another presidential election less than nine months away, they are offering Venezuela a path toward rejoining the democratic world.More evidence that Mr. Chavez at last faces a serious domestic challenge came Tuesday, when one of the new leaders, 40-year-old Leopoldo Lopez, stepped out of an opposition competition to choose a presidential candidate in favor of 39-year-old Henrique Capriles Radonski — making the latter the overwhelming favorite in a Feb.?12 primary. Mr. Capriles, who upset one of Mr. Chavez’s closest allies in 2008 to become the governor of the key state of Miranda, styles himself as a Venezuelan version of Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, the immensely popular former Brazilian president who created a new regional model of center-left government. Both Mr. Capriles and Mr. Lopez have worked their way up in Venezuelan politics over the past decade despite constant persecution by Mr. Chavez, while never abandoning the democratic system.Polls show Mr. Capriles in a dead heat with Mr. Chavez, even though the president has benefited from a wave of public sympathy since revealing seven months ago that he had been treated in Cuba for cancer. Any doubt that the strongman is worried about his political future was erased this month when Mr. Chavez shook up his government by appointing two longtime military allies to key posts — most notably, Gen. Henry Rangel Silva as defense minister. Gen. Rangel has been designated by the U.S. Treasury as an international narcotics kingpin for his well-documented involvement in cocaine trafficking in tandem with Colombia’s FARC terrorist group. In Venezuela, he is notorious for declaring that the military would not tolerate an opposition election victory.It’s possible that Mr. Capriles will never get his chance to challenge Mr. Chavez at the ballot box. Though the president claims that he is cured of cancer, he has not revealed the details of his illness, and more than one foreign report has said that he suffers from an incurable malignancy. But no one should wish for Mr. Chavez’s untimely death. Instead, the democratic world should be hoping, and campaigning, for a free and fair presidential vote in October — and a democratic victory by Venezuela’s new opposition.</td>\n",

       "      <td>CARACAS, Venezuela — Sixty-seven days after Venezuelans last saw him, President Hugo Chavez reappeared Friday when government officials televised photographs of him recuperating in Cuba with two of his daughters at his side.The images were the first evidence presented to Venezuelans that Chavez, who was last seen publicly Dec. 10 when he boarded a plane to Cuba for a fourth surgery to remove cancerous tissue, was alive and convalescing.In the photos, Chavez smiles from a hospital bed while flanked by daughters Maria Gabriela and Rosa Virginia. They are pictured looking at Thursday’s edition of Cuba’s state newspaper, Granma, the images serving as a sort of proof of life to those who doubted that El Comandante remained alive. The photos were shown on state television by Science and Technology Minister Jorge Arreaza, Chavez’s son-in-law.The photographs have come as tensions have flared in Venezuela, with opposition leaders increasingly demanding to see evidence that Chavez has been recuperating, as his aides have claimed.Although he had once held forth on television as if he were the host of a reality show, there has been nothing but silence since his December surgery. No photographs or video had been released. Chavez missed his Jan. 10 swearing in for a fourth term, following a bruising reelection campaign last year. He had also stopped posting on Twitter and making late-night phone calls to his favorite state television interviewers.Then on Friday morning, Information Minister Ernesto Villegas said that after a “complicated postoperative process, the patient is conscious, with his intellectual functions intact, in close communication with his government team.”Villegas said that a respiratory infection had been controlled but that Chavez still faced difficulties. “Under these circumstances, which are being treated, the commander is currently breathing through a tracheal tube,” he said.Doctors were “applying energetic treatment for the illness,” he said, adding that there could be complications. The government has not said what kind of cancer Chavez has, whether it is spreading or what the prognosis is.But Villegas struck a hopeful tone in his public comments, saying: “We are confident, along with the Venezuelans and the other peoples of the world, that Chavez will overcome these delicate circumstances sooner rather than later to accompany his people on the path toward new victories.”Who is in charge?The disclosure came a day after Henrique Capriles, the 40-year-old leader of Venezuela’s opposition, demanded that the government present details about the president’s health. Directing his comments at Venezuelan officials, Capriles said that if Chavez did not appear publicly “then you’re lying” about him being in charge of the day-to-day affairs of government.Indeed, some Venezuelans had begun to wonder whether the man who single-handedly ran this country for 14 years was really in charge, even as Chavez’s lieutenants contended that he had been closely involved in every key decision over the past two months.This past week, Arreaza said in public comments that Chavez had so meticulously analyzed images from Venezuela’s new satellite that he was prompted to order spot inspections of untilled land.The president had also ordered increased spending on state factories, another minister reported, and approved a devaluation of the currency that went into effect Wednesday.The wheels of government, to be sure, had still been churning in this oil-rich country.But for some people here, Venezuela has been in a sort of tropical twilight zone, with officials resolutely contending that Chavez is involved in every intricate detail of governance, even though no one outside of a small cadre of ministers and family members had access to him.“We’re living in a fantasy world,” said Aida Barreto, 56, who says that, like other Venezuelans, she’s exasperated by the political uncertainty. “I think what they are telling us are lies, really, because we’re being governed by someone we can’t see. And the only one who we obey and can’t see is God.”Meanwhile, Venezuela is being buffeted by a series of crises that seem magnified because of questions about who really is the central authority in the government.In January, a prison riot left 58 dead, while sky-high inflation is eating into Venezuelans’ earnings. Food shortages, a fact of life for years, seemed to grow worse, with a vast range of items, including chicken, cooking oil and flour, missing from many stores’ shelves. Topping it off was the devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar by 32 percent, a policy move analysts say the government was forced to make because of heavy campaign-related spending last year that nearly tripled the fiscal deficit.This week at the giant Excelsior Gama supermarket, shelves for chicken and turkey were empty; there was no toilet paper or the flour used in cornmeal cakes. The aisles carrying cleaning supplies were mostly empty.“Last week, there was a lot of toilet paper, now there isn’t any. Why?” said Galeazzo Ferrari, 63, an art gallery manager, as he guided his cart through a half-empty aisle.Johanna Hauser, 50, a former bank worker, said it has gotten to the point that when she finds a product that has been missing for weeks — say corn oil — she will call relatives or friends who quickly rush to the store to stock up.“It’s like a carnival,” she said. “It’s like an adventure. You come here, and products are missing, so you go to try to find them wherever you can.”The government had reacted to the criticism by taking a page from Chavez’s playbook — charging that companies hoard products to drive up prices and that political opponents are using Chavez’s absence to destabilize the state and plot an assassination of top administration officials.“They’ve orchestrated a macabre and criminal plot with the purpose of killing us, something they won’t be able to achieve,” Vice President Nicolas Maduro recently told supporters, claiming he was a target.He then promised “an iron fist against the conspiracy of the right,” without providing evidence of the plot or naming the conspirators.The government has also begun legal proceedings against Globovision, the only anti-Chavez television network in the country, saying that its coverage of Chavez’s health crisis is causing “anxiety” in the country.At the same time, state television networks have been playing one after another spot featuring Chavez hugging children or being lauded by older Venezuelans for his social policies.“Get better,” says an elderly woman in one ad. “We need you in the country.” The spots finish with these words: “Now, more than ever, it’s with Chavez.”Only few, vague details releasedBut the few details released about the president’s condition have been vague.And some of those who had released the details surprised Venezuelans. Earlier this week, for instance, the Cuban government issued the transcript of an interview with Fidel Castro, in which Cuba’s ex-president reported that Chavez “is recovering” although it has been “difficult and hard.”Castro’s comments, however, had been made nine days earlier, Feb. 3, and the delay in their publication was not explained.Last Saturday, Venezuela’s foreign minister, Elias Jaua, said Chavez was going through a “slow, slow recovery process.” He added that Chavez is “fighting his battle with great faith, and clinging to Christ and clinging to life.”Then on Wednesday, Maduro said Chavez was “receiving complementary treatments” that he called “extremely complex and tough treatments.” The vice president did not elaborate on what kind of treatments they were.Despite the uncertainty, there is no void of power, said Luis Vicente Leon, a pollster who runs the Caracas firm Datanalisis. He said that Chavez’s illness increased his approval ratings in December, the last month that Datanalisis had completed a political poll in the country.Leon said the personal, almost-mystical connection Chavez has with poor Venezuelan</td>\n",

       "      <td>Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro has had quite a run of it lately.A couple of months ago, his allies in the Supreme Court tried to dissolve the country's opposition-controlled legislative branch. That prompted a swift backlash, with thousands of Venezuelans participating in regular, sustained protest efforts. Over the past few months, more than 120 people have been killed. And now, Maduro has convened a super-assembly to rewrite the constitution. Opposition leaders worry this body will effectively replace the country's legislature and allow Maduro to crack down on dissent.This naked power grab has prompted international condemnation and a threat of massive U.S. sanctions. President Trump said that Maduro has joined an “exclusive club” of dictators. How did this former bus driver and groupie become one of the most reviled leaders in the world?Maduro began his political life as president of the student union at his local high school. He never graduated, but the son of two leftists left an impression. “He would address us during the assembly to talk about students' rights and that sort of thing. He didn't speak much and wasn't agitating people into action but what he did say was usually poignant,” Grisel Rojas, a former classmate who is now the school's principal, told the Guardian.After a brief flirtation with rock music, Maduro became a bus driver in Caracas, Venezuela's capital. Along with his father, he organized a local union. He was also active in the MBR-200, the civilian wing of Hugo Chávez's military movement. He campaigned frequently for Chávez's release from prison.Once Chávez was released, Maduro joined his political operation, helping to rewrite the 1999 constitution and joining the National Assembly. When Chávez became president, he named Maduro foreign minister. In that role, he famously took on the United States, comparing Guantanamo Bay prison to the Holocaust.When Chávez was dying of cancer, he urged Venezuela to elect Maduro, a man he described as “a complete revolutionary, a man of great experience despite his youth, with great dedication and capacity for work, for leading, for handling the most difficult situations.”Maduro campaigned as Chávez's protege. On national television, he recounted how the president came to him from the grave in the form of a song bird. “All of a sudden, a little bird circled three times around me, stopped on a wooden beam, and began to sing a pretty song,” Maduro said. “Then I, too, began to whistle,” he said, whistling like a bird as he talked. “The little bird looked at me in a strange way. He sang, circled me once and flew away. And I felt his spirit. I felt him giving us a blessing, saying now the battle begins, go to victory.”Maduro ran on a socialist platform, saying that it's him or the oligarchy. He was narrowly elected in April 2013 by a margin of just 1.5 percent.Since that narrow win, Maduro has been trying to channel his predecessor. As my colleagues reported: “Maduro often dresses like Chávez, talks like Chávez and has even told Venezuelans that he has slept in Chávez’s tomb. Wednesday’s anniversary events will give him the chance to remind ‘Chavista’ loyalists that he’s the late commandante’s chosen one. “Chávez sets the route, Maduro takes the wheel,” was the campaign slogan he ran on, playing up his blue-collar bus-driver background.”He also mimicked Chávez's tough talk toward enemies, immediately expelling U.S. diplomats and accusing “historical enemies” of poisoning Chávez.Maduro, however, lacks Chávez's chavismo. “While Chavez was a very charismatic leader who was able to maintain cohesion among different groups within the government structure, Maduro doesn't have that ability, and he also doesn't have the money that Chavez had because the price of oil has plummeted,” Taraciuk Broner told NBC news. “He doesn't have the funds to sustain all the social programs that Chavez had.”Maduro has had to deal with an economic crisis that Chávez did not have to face. The country's economy, heavily dependent on petroleum production, began to falter, then entered free fall as the price of crude oil plummeted. During Maduro's four years in office, the country's economy has shrunk by 23 percent. People are starving, and the Venezuelan government cannot get the food or medicine people need. About three-quarters of the country's citizens have lost weight in the past year. And with growing levels of desperation, crime has spiked.The economic crisis has turned into protests and a political crisis that has been exacerbated by Maduro. He has cracked down on his opponents, arresting opposition leaders on “conspiracy” charges. He censored unflattering news coverage and allowed his national guardsmen to club activists in the streets, bloody scenes that are captured on television. He lacks Chávez's gift for language, instead railing against the “fascists” in the street in near nightly speeches. Even his propaganda suffers — Maduro was roundly mocked after he went on a television program and performed a song for Venezuelan unity.As a result, the country's opposition, long derided as weak and disorganized, has grown much stronger. Even members of Maduro's working-class base have begun to question the leader's fitness for office. Last year, a poll showed his approval rating in the low 20s. Time magazine called him the “world's most embattled political leader.”</td>\n",

       "      <td>Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez will undergo his fourth cancer surgery in Cuba in the coming days, the fiery leader said over the weekend, explaining that he had decided to designate a successor in case the illness forces him to resign from the office he has held for nearly 14 years.The announcement was the clearest sign yet that Chavez’s battle with cancer could abruptly end his self-described socialist revolution. It prompted his followers to flock to churches and public squares Sunday to pray and chant slogans supporting him.Saturday night, in a dour address on television, the president said “some malignant cells” had been detected in his pelvic region that would necessitate surgery in Havana’s Cimeq hospital, where he has been treated before. Chavez said he would fly to Cuba on Sunday, although the government did not confirm his departure.Chavez, 58, said his vice president and confidant, Nicolas Maduro, would assume control if he has to step down. The populist leader urged supporters to vote for Maduro, who made his mark as Chavez’s foreign minister, should there be a need for a presidential election.“If something happens that sidelines me, which under the constitution requires a new presidential election, you should elect Nicolas Maduro as president,” Chavez said, sitting at a table with Maduro at his side. “I ask that of you from my heart.”Moises Naim, a former Venezuelan government official who is an analyst at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington, called the announcement “basically a farewell speech.”“He said goodbye to power,” Naim said. “It’s a statement full of resignation and appeals to God. There is no plan. The only talk of the future is that there will be elections and he asks for people to vote for Maduro.”Chavez’s departure would mark the end of a tumultuous rule in which the leftist former army officer harnessed Venezuela’s considerable oil wealth to shower the poor with social programs while engineering a sharp diplomatic shift away from the country’s historical ally, the United States.Chavez’s government forged alliances with some of Washington’s most intransigent adversaries, including Cuba, Iran and Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. He has used his lock on practically all levers of power, from the courts to the congress, to push forward the nationalization of hundreds of private companies and the seizure of wide swaths of farmland.For Venezuela’s opposition, the possible scenarios that Chavez discussed in Saturday’s address amount to the first time the president has publicly acknowledged the severity of his illness and the impact it could have on the future of the country.No one in the government is authorized to discuss Chavez’s medical condition except Chavez himself, who astonished his countrymen in June 2011 by telling them he had gone under the knife twice to remove a malignant growth. A third surgery followed in February.Chavez has never disclosed what kind of cancer he has or where it is located. He has twice pronounced himself cured, without providing details.“It was time to tell the truth to the country,” said Maria Corina Machado, an opposition member of the National Assembly. “Venezuela has been living with a lot of uncertainty. In a democratic country where the constitution is obeyed, the president must talk about his health when it is compromised.”Should Chavez die or have to resign, the constitution calls for Venezuela to stage presidential elections within 30 days. Maduro, a 50-year-old former union organizer and bus driver who has risen through the ranks of Chavez’s movement, would become the candidate of the president’s United Socialist Party.The constitution also requires that the vice president fill in for the president should he be temporarily absent. Chavez has spent many weeks in Cuba in the past 18 months, undergoing chemotherapy and radiation treatments. But he has remained in charge of the government, signing decrees and bills from Havana.Machado said the opposition will call for a strict interpretation of the constitution now that Chavez has suggested the possibility of stepping aside.“Article 233 of the constitution is clear about the only mechanism, an election within 30 days,” she said. “He can’t name a successor. It’s the Venezuelan people who decide.”An election would mean a contest between Maduro and the opposition’s leader, Henrique Capriles.Capriles lost to Chavez in the presidential election held Oct. 7, with the incumbent winning 55 percent of the vote to the challenger’s 44 percent. Polls, though, have shown that Capriles is more popular in Venezuela than all of Chavez’s closest associates, including Maduro.The president’s swearing-in for another six-year term is scheduled for Jan. 10, but his announcement, following weeks in which he remained out of public view, raised questions about whether the inauguration will take place.“This is how life goes,” Chavez said in his televised address. “God willing, I hope to be able to give you good news in the coming days.”</td>\n",

       "      <td>Back in fall 2010, one of those absurd memes began circulating in think tanks, on the Internet and around trading desks regarding the impact of uncertainty. “Oh no!” declared pundits. “The economy cannot recover so long as it is racked with uncertainty.”Not coincidentally, the first go-round was right before the midterm elections in the United States. The “uncertainty trope” is back again, and — what a surprising coincidence! — during another election year.Indeed, Google Trends reveals that there is a pattern to the media use of the term “uncertainty.” It starts high in the beginning of the year, as media outlets trot out their year-in-preview pieces. It hits its nadir over the summer as families vacation and the latest fun and sun articles are de rigueur. It ramps up to a distinct peak in October and November, just as voters head to the polls in state, local and federal elections. In a fairly evenly divided country, there is surely uncertainty about election contests. Then it bottoms out around the holidays. While you may not know what you are getting for Christmas, Google’s not high on “uncertainty” either.Uncertainty has become a news media darling since 2008. The recession, credit crisis and market collapse drive lots of interest in the idea.It does not take much deep thought to recognize the utter nonsense of this. Anyone complaining about a lack of certainty — in policy, in the economy, in markets or even the weather — simply reveals how little they understand about all of these things.From the investor’s perspective, markets require uncertainty to function. Indeed, they thrive on doubt, imperfect information and a lack of consensus. Uncertainty drives the market’s price-discovery mechanism. Investing requires differences of opinion, for when there is broad agreement about an asset’s fair value, trading volume falls.Without uncertainty, who would take the opposite side of your trade?History teaches us that whenever the opposite occurs — when groupthink and consensus overwhelm doubt — the herd tends to be embarrassingly wrong. In those rare instances when there is a near-total lack of uncertainty in the market, the outcome usually is a spectacular disaster.Think of the false certainty surrounding the peak of the dot-com bubble (profits don’t matter!), or the nadir in March 2009 (the abyss awaits!) to validate just how true this is.Indeed, during the dot-com era, everyone knew that profits no longer mattered — it was all about eyeballs and clicks! With uncertainty banished, an epic crash followed.After that implosion, the pendulum swung to the opposite extreme. There were lots of profitable, debt-free tech companies trading for less than book value. I recall that the stock of MicroMuse, a former high-flying telecom that had traded for more than $200 at its peak, was trading at $1.43. That was less than the $2-a-share cash it had on its debt-free balance sheets and far below its $3 book value. Investors had become certain that a dollar was worth only 75 cents. (IBM eventually bought MicroMuse for more than $10 a share).The March 2009 stock-market lows were not so long ago. At the time, nearly everyone was sure the world was falling into the abyss. There was little uncertainty then, causing massive and indiscriminate selling. I wonder whether those certain panicked sellers are happy they followed the consensus on dumping equities ahead of a 109-percent rally.Caroline Baum, the savvy longtime economics observer and Bloomberg columnist, notes: “The future is always uncertain. It was uncertain in 1999, yet investors were buying stocks of Internet companies that had no revenue, no profits and no real business plan. It was uncertain during the condo-flipping frenzy in 2005, as well. And no one mistook irrational exuberance for uncertainty.”Since then, the uncertainty trope has become the general catch-all for explaining (or mis-explaining) a variety of future events. The list of uncertainties is long: The fiscal cliff, U.S. tax policy, health-care laws, what happens in Greece, will we have a recession next year or not, is housing recovering, what happens to the euro zone, will the euro currency collapse, what about the U.S. elections?I recall no one saying that investing was difficult due to the uncertainty caused by a potential nuclear conflagration between the United States and the Soviet Union during the Cold War. The sword of Damocles hung over everyone’s head. Is the Greek situation today more dire or uncertain than the policy of mutually assured destruction ever was?Regardless, all of these unknown events will be resolved one way or another at some point in the future. Which is, of course, how all ambiguities eventually get resolved — at some future unknown date. That is why the uncertainty claim is so absurdist. The lack of understanding today of an unknowable future always gets revealed as the future becomes known to us.This is how things unfold in a linear timeline.It finally dawned on me what the uncertainty trope is all about. It took a conversation with a nervous chief executive to reveal it, but I teased out the answer.Most of the time, people exist in a happy little bubble of self-created delusion. We engage in selective perception, seeing only the things that agree with us. Our selective retention retains the good stuff and disregards most of the rest. In our minds, we are all younger, better-looking, slimmer, with more hair than the camera reveals.In short, we construct a reality that bears only passing resemblance to the objective universe.During those brief instances when the facade fades, the curtain gets pulled back and the ugly reality becomes clear. We get a glimmer of understanding about our own lack of understanding. That’s when the grim reality of the human condition is revealed — and it terrifies us.The next time you hear someone mention uncertainty, ask yourself this: How much less do they actually know about the future today vs. what they knew last week or year? How much less do they think they know?We need only consider the track record of Wall Street’s prognosticators to recognize how little we know about what awaits down the line.Ritholtz is chief executive of FusionIQ, a quantitative research firm.

       "      <td>Weakened from battling cancer and visibly bloated, President Hugo Chavez is fighting for his political life in Sunday’s presidential election, as he faces a charismatic challenger who has energized a once-disunited opposition in a way none of the populist leader’s foes ever has.At stake is the president’s experiment to remake Venezuela, a 14-year transformation characterized by the expropriation of private companies, diplomatic initiatives to counter U.S. influence and a near-mystical bond with the country’s poor masses.Two established pollsters show Chavez, 58, with a substantial advantage, underscoring the loyalty of millions he has commanded since sweeping into power in 1998. But two others have Chavez and Henrique Capriles, 40, a lawyer and former governor who has never lost an election, in a virtual dead heat.“This is seriously competitive,” said Cynthia Arnson, director of the Americas program at the Woodrow Wilson Center in Washington. “I would say it’s the first time since Chavez was elected that the accumulated learning experience of the opposition and the accumulated problems of the country have brought the race to a place where it’s almost too close to call.”The election is almost certainly being watched closely by Iran, which has found an ally in Venezuela, and myriad small countries in Latin America that have received aid in return for opposing Washington.The outcome is also expected to be tracked by energy markets. Venezuela recently surpassed Saudi Arabia as the country with the biggest certified oil reserves, and Chavez is considered a price hawk within the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, or OPEC, an organization Venezuela helped found.Capriles campaign officials said they believe that the large number of undecided voters identified in some polls will back the challenger at the ballot box, leading to Chavez’s defeat. That bold prediction is buttressed by the opposition’s revival after years of uninspired campaigning and the disenchantment many Venezuelans express to pollsters about decaying infrastructure, rampant violent crime and shoddy services.But the president’s advantage is undeniable. State media have delivered fawning campaign coverage while the Chavez administration has doled out refrigerators, new apartments and other gifts to prospective voters.“He has given love and made it easy for the people, the only president we have had who has had anything to do with the poor,” said Soleña Arcila, a nurse who came out Thursday for Chavez’s last pre-election speech. “Chavez will be here forever.”Still, there are signs that things are not as rosy for the president as they have been in the past. Political analysts say Chavez’s campaign has been lackluster, and nagging questions remain about his health, which is a state secret.That has many Venezuelans wondering whether the dashing former army paratrooper who stormed to prominence a generation ago as the leader of a failed coup has mustered the emotional appeal needed to get millions of voters to once more cast ballots for him.Although the president still gives a resounding speech, the Chavez of this campaign has resorted to issuing the kinds of pleas expected from a candidate coming from behind.“This government will be much better than all the governments of Chavez,” the president, who often speaks about himself in the third person, said in a recent speech. “I promise I will be a much better president than I have been.”‘The country needs a change’The Venezuela the two men are battling for is a country awash in historic oil earnings, but one that has the feel of having missed out on the democratic awakening and economic boom that is modernizing much of Latin America.Bridges and highways are decrepit, patients are forced to bring their own medicine to public hospitals, vast state projects are unfinished, rolling blackouts affect much of the country and prison riots kill hundreds each year.Polls show that voters are most concerned about a sharp rise in homicides, with 19,336 people killed last year, up from 4,550 in 1998 when Chavez was first elected president, according to the Venezuelan Violence Observatory, a group that tracks crime.“How could they fail to read what the people were thinking after 14 years?” Capriles asked in a recent speech. “The people are tired of that.”Chavez’s rhetorical flourishes against the United States and his warnings about the bourgeoisie may still electrify radicals. But they fall short for ordinary people whipsawed by problems, said Carlos Romero, a political scientist and co-author of the recent book “U.S.-Venezuela Relations Since the 1990s.”“Most of the people in Venezuela are tired of Chavez’s political speeches, the speeches that are very radical, that try to divide Venezuelans and don’t take into account the most important problems that Venezuelans are facing every day,” Romero said.Standing at the doorway of her home in the Petare hillside slum as the sun went down on a recent day, Maria Uribe, a public school teacher, said she has seen few improvements in the classrooms and worries about her son, Luis Martinez, 9, because of the violence in their neighborhood.“The truth is that the country needs a change,” she said. “This country is completely deteriorated, forgotten, in need of maintenance and of leaders who will truly concern themselves with the country.”As she spoke, others emerged from cinder-block homes to say that they, too, felt new leadership was needed.Joel Hernandez, 26, recounted how gunmen stole his motorcycle on a recent afternoon. Barbara Rodriguez, 32, who benefits from a government job providing maintenance in a community center, said the economy provides her with no other job possibilities.“The candidate Chavez has 14 years at this and hasn’t been able to handle it,” said Eder Granados, 44, who owns a small Internet cafe, ticking off problems in the country. “It’s time to give someone else the chance to see what they can do.”Many here say the president’s campaign manifesto, which is partly focused on countering “savage capitalism” and guaranteeing “planetary peace,” is out of touch with people who have to contend with one of the world’s highest inflation rates.‘The candidate of happiness’Chavez has heaped endless insults on Capriles, calling him a chameleon who would usher in a right-wing government, controlled by Washington and intent on ending popular social programs. Capriles styles himself as a center-left candidate, much like Brazil’s former president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, and says he will make state-sponsored aid more efficient.“Who’s the candidate of the Yankees, of the bourgeoisie, of big business, of the super-rich?” Chavez would ask throngs of supporters in speech after speech, with his followers shouting back a favorite put-down of Capriles.“Who’s the candidate of happiness? Of the future, of the young people, of the fatherland?” he would continue, to shouts of his name. “That is why Chavez wins on October 7.”For many, of course, that message still resonates.Loyalists such as Ismar Mota, 54, who works in a state agency and campaigns for Chavez, said he wants to extend Chavez’s political life.“There’s more to be done to consolidate socialism,” Mota said. “And though it has been 14 years, the president has the will and the desire to make Venezuela a great country, a power, a dignified country.”More world news coverage:- Food prices, inflation rise sharply in Iran- Pakistani politician plans drone attacks protest- Tensions persist between Turkey, Syria- Read more headlines from around the world</td>\n",

       "      <td>CARACAS, Venezuela —Henrique Capriles, a young governor who ran a spirited but unsuccessful effort to unseat President Hugo Chavez in an October election, said Sunday that he will run against the late president’s handpicked successor in a snap vote that will determine the future of the late leader’s self-styled socialist revolution.Capriles, 40, said he will accept the nomination of a coalition of opposition groups to face off on April 14 against Nicolas Maduro, who served Chavez as vice president until Chavez died Tuesday after a long ordeal with cancer. On Friday, Maduro, 50, was inaugurated president and vowed to continue Chavez’s radical agenda to remake this OPEC nation as a show of “the most absolute loyalty to the commander, Hugo Chavez.”Polls show Maduro would win an election against Capriles. The outpouring of emotion for the late president, who is glorified in 24-hour coverage on state television as a mythical visionary who transformed Venezuela for the betterment of its poor masses, is expected to be transferred to Maduro.But Capriles said he will not back down, even though he had been casually told by someone earlier in the day that he was being “led to a slaughterhouse.”“I want to tell our people — from here inside, clinging to God, in whom I believe — that I am going to fight,” Capriles said, in a pointed address in which he accused the government of using Chavez’s death to campaign.“Nicolas,” Capriles said, speaking directly to Maduro, “I am not going to leave you an open road, friend. You will have to defeat me with votes. I am going to fight with these hands. I’ll fight for each vote.”Capriles said the government had known that Chavez was dying and had been laying the groundwork for decisions by the Supreme Court and the electoral board that permitted Maduro to run after the populist leader’s death.“They’ve been lying to the Venezuelans,” Capriles said. “All this was coldly calculated, when they would hold elections, the chronogram for the whole electoral process.”He added: “Who knows when President Chavez died? You had everything fixed.”Maduro, in a live speech, called Capriles’s accusations “a declaration of war.”“What’s been said is grave, very grave,” he said. “It’s the worst that we could have expected.”Chavez’s cancer was a state secret, and the public was never told what kind of tumor he had.Maduro, in his inaugural address, spoke about Chavez’s ordeal and revealed that the president believed as early as June 2011 that the tumor was severe.“He told us, ‘This is worse than what you think or what the doctors say,’ ” Maduro said, recounting discussions in Cuba, where Chavez was treated.Chavez, however, would later announce publicly that he had been cured on two occasions.Maduro also said in his speech that in December, Chavez’s “intuition” was that he was not going to emerge from the operation that awaited him in Havana. Indeed, Chavez never recovered from the Dec. 11 surgery. Still, Maduro and other officials often spoke hopefully about the president’s health in the weeks that followed, even saying he was running the day-to-day affairs of state.Capriles also said the government violated the constitution because the head of congress should have been designated interim leader upon Chavez’s death. The elevation of Maduro to acting president, Capriles said, allowed the government to get around an article in the constitution that bars sitting vice presidents from running for the presidency.It is easy to see why Capriles would not want to face Maduro.For many Venezuelans, El Comandante’s last directive is ingrained: On Dec. 8, Chavez told his countrymen in his final public comments that they should throw their support behind Maduro if Chavez became unable to govern.“I ask you that from my heart,” he said in what turned out to be his farewell to the nation.“He will be our president because our commander gave the order to put him there in power,” said Gregorio Villamizar, 38, who said he worshiped Chavez and would follow any of his orders. “He was a Chavez ally, the successor to Chavez, and he was the only one Chavez prepared to take power.”Luis Vicente Leon, director of a Caracas-based polling company whose surveys show Maduro with more support than Capriles, has said that because the election is coming so soon after Chavez’s death, many will see it as a contest between Capriles and Chavez.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Fidel Castro, who led a Cuban revolution that made his Caribbean island a potent symbol of the 20th-century ideological and economic divisions, and whose embrace of communism and the former Soviet Union put the world at the risk of nuclear war, died Nov. 25. He was 90.His death was announced on Cuban state TV by his younger brother, Raúl Castro, who succeeded Fidel 10 years ago as the country’s leader. The cause of death was not immediately disclosed, but Mr. Castro had been in failing health for several years.The son of a prosperous sugar planter, Mr. Castro took power in Cuba on New Year’s Day 1959, promising to share his nation’s wealth with its poorest citizens, who had suffered under the corrupt quarter-century dictatorship of Fulgencio Batista.Mr. Castro, a romantic figure in olive-drab fatigues and combat boots, chomping monstrous cigars through a bushy black beard, became a spiritual beacon for the world’s political far left.To his legion of followers, Mr. Castro was a hero who demanded a fair deal for the world’s poor and wasn’t afraid to point his pistol at the powerful to get it. His admirers said he educated, fed and provided health care to his own people, as well as to the poor in other countries, more fairly and generously than the world’s wealthy nations, most notably what he called the “Colossus to the north.”He remained one of world’s longest-serving heads of state, controlling his island nation 90 miles from U.S. shores for nearly five decades. In his homeland, Mr. Castro was as loathed as he was beloved. He was among the world’s most repressive leaders, a self-appointed president-for-life who banned free speech, freedom of assembly and a free press, and who executed or jailed thousands of political opponents.He abolished Christmas as an official holiday for nearly 30 years. While he dispatched Cuban-educated doctors and Cuban-developed vaccines to the poorest corners of Latin America, Cubans in central Havana found pharmacy shelves empty of medicine, and many lived in apartments in which they used buckets in their kitchens as toilets.With almost theatrical relish, Mr. Castro taunted 10 successive U.S. presidents, who viewed the Cuban leader variously as a potential courier of Armageddon, a blowhard nuisance, a dangerous dictator, a fomenter of revolution around Latin America, a serial human rights abuser or an irrelevant sideshow who somehow hung on after the collapse of communism almost everywhere else.Mr. Castro’s long reign began to unravel on July 31, 2006, when he temporarily transferred power to his 75-year-old brother, Raúl, after undergoing what he described as intestinal surgery. (The precise nature of Mr. Castro’s health problems was an official state secret.) The transfer of power came weeks before Mr. Castro’s 80th birthday on Aug. 13, and Mr. Castro was not seen in public again for nearly four years.He formally resigned on Feb. 19, 2008, in a statement read on national television by a spokesman, ending his 49-year reign and giving George W. Bush the distinction of being the first U.S. president to outlast Mr. Castro in power.The National Assembly officially — and unanimously — named Raúl Castro, the longtime head of the Cuban armed forces, as the country’s new president. The move was seen as deeply anticlimactic, because Mr. Castro had stage-managed the shift to his brother for the better part of two years.Beginning in the 1960s, the United States maintained a strict trade and diplomatic embargo against Cuba, hoping to drive Mr. Castro from power. In 2014, President Obama — the first U.S. president elected in the post-Fidel era — announced plans to restore full diplomatic relations with Havana. During a visit to Cuba in March 2016, Obama met Raúl Castro but made no effort to meet his brother. Fidel Castro later delivered a speech, dismissing Obama’s overtures and denouncing the idea of cooperation with the United States.Tweaking the “imperialists” was always a passion of Mr. Castro’s. He built an enormous public demonstration space — complete with stage lighting and sound — outside the U.S. diplomatic mission on the Malecon, Havana’s main seaside boulevard. There, he regularly led anti-American rallies and delivered the lengthy speeches for which he was famous.He was a particular thorn to President John F. Kennedy, who approved the clumsy Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba in April 1961 by a ragtag group of CIA-trained fighters, which became a humiliating low point of Kennedy’s presidency.To Mr. Castro’s benefactors in the Kremlin during the height of the Cold War, he was the useful commander of a communist citadel on the doorstep of the United States. That point was drawn in terrifyingly stark terms during the Cuban missile crisis of 1962, when Mr. Castro allowed the Soviets to base on his soil missiles that could carry nuclear warheads to Washington or New York in minutes. The resulting showdown between Kennedy and Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev was the closest the world has come to nuclear war.Unlike many other communist leaders around the world, Mr. Castro did not create monuments to himself or lend his name to streets and buildings. Instead, he erected billboards carrying patriotic slogans of the revolution, such as “We will overcome!,” “Toward victory, always!” and “Motherland or death!”Under his reign, Havana eventually became something of a Marxist Disneyland — a shiny, happy veneer over something much uglier.Mr. Castro personally ordered the restoration of Old Havana, an architectural gem where tourists can savor $300 boxes of Cuban cigars, some of the world’s best music and sweet Havana Club rum — the proceeds of which went to Mr. Castro’s revolution. But just a block behind the restored facades, impoverished Cubans lived in crumbling homes on rationed food. Teenage prostitutes openly offered their services to tourists.In his later years, Mr. Castro enjoyed a resurgence in popularity across much of Latin America, fueled in part by the election of several leaders inspired by his staunch anti-Americanism.In particular, President Hugo Chávez of Venezuela viewed Mr. Castro as a political beacon and father figure to the Latin American left. Sweetheart oil deals from Chávez, until his death in March 2013, were crucial to Cuba’s ability to survive as its state-dominated economy sputtered.While many Cubans expressed genuine and deep loyalty to Fidel — he was never called “Castro” in his homeland — others clearly feared a leader who imprisoned tens of thousands of his enemies over the years, often on little more than a whim.As he aged, Mr. Castro acted more like a man intent on purifying his legacy, returning his revolution to its ideological core, reversing economic openings and stepping up attacks on political dissent. He imprisoned Cubans whose crimes were as simple as passing out books on democracy.Many Cubans would not offer criticism of their leader for fear of being overheard by government informants, who lived on practically every block. To indicate Mr. Castro, they would tug on an imaginary beard. Other residents accepted him as a simple fact of life, like the tropical humidity — what good would it do to complain?The most pointed condemnations came from Cubans who fled Mr. Castro’s rule by the thousands every year. Those with enough money paid for speedboat trips across the Straits of Florida, while the poorest attempted the dangerous trip in rickety boats. Some would-be émigrés refitted Cuba’s aging American-made cars and trucks, transforming them into unlikely boats.After Raúl Castro assumed power, he embarked on a plan of economic liberalization that has been more symbolic than substantial. Private enterprise is permitted in a few small segments, such as food service and repair shops, but the military-led government still controls as much as 80 percent of the economy.Mr. Castro slowed noticeably in his final years. He had long ago given up cigars and rum, and his beard faded from thick and black to scraggly</td>\n",

       "      <td>CARACAS, Venezuela — His loss in Sunday’s presidential election was resounding, but in conceding defeat before tearful followers, Henrique Capriles hinted at an active political future that may yet pose a challenge to President Hugo Chavez’s self-proclaimed socialist revolution.“There are more than 6 million people who are looking for a better future, and I want to tell those more than 6 million Venezuelans to count on me,” Capriles said late Sunday, in reference to the votes he received. “I am at your service.”Capriles’s supporters were crestfallen after Chavez garnered about 55 percent of the vote to about 44 percent for an opposition determined to end 14 years of populist rule in one of the world’s biggest oil exporters. Capriles conceded in a subdued, emotional address, while throngs of red-shirted “Chavistas” rejoiced as El Comandante gave yet another rousing victory speech from the presidential palace’s “people’s balcony.”Capriles did not provide details, but the managers of his campaign on Monday said the opposition would actively engage the government in December’s elections for governorships.And there are lingering doubts about Chavez’s health, although he has declared himself free of cancer. The president, 58, has said he has undergone three operations since June 2011 to remove a tumor, raising questions about whether he will be able to complete the six-year term that begins next year.If he were to die in the first four years of that term, Venezuela would have to call new elections — potentially giving Capriles another chance.“Capriles would have strong possibilities to be elected in that case,” said Margarita Lopez Maya, a Caracas analyst and writer who had once supported the president. “There is not a charismatic leader who could replace Chavez within Chavismo.”Lopez Maya believes that it would be “a grave error for Capriles to think that this was a defeat.”She said the unification of disparate Chavez foes, some of them from the right and others disaffected leftists who believe the president is an autocrat, has matured and prepared the opposition for future political battles. “It’s a strengthening that has been very significant,” she said.Lopez Maya and other analysts see positive signs for the opposition in comparing Sunday’s vote with past elections.The 6.4 million votes Capriles received represented 2.1 million more than went for opposition candidate Manuel Rosales in the 2006 presidential contest. Chavez won that election by 26 percentage points, demolishing Rosales’s political career.This time, the margin was far closer. Chavez also increased his vote count compared with 2006, by about 700,000 ballots. But the number of people who voted Sunday was 3 million higher than in 2006, when fewer than 12 million went to the polls.“What’s changed since those years is not Chavez but the opposition,” said Luis Vicente Leon, whose Caracas polling company, Datanalisis, correctly predicted Sunday’s margin of victory for Chavez.Unlike all the other candidates who have run against Chavez since 1998, Capriles solidified his position as the leader of the opposition by running a focused, well-organized campaign in which he visited most of Venezuela’s towns and cities and generated the kind of support the opposition had never seen before, Leon said.“Capriles generated emotion that you saw in the streets, that you saw in the rallies,” Leon said. “That didn’t lead to a win, but it’s something to capitalize on for the future.”For the government, the win means Chavez will deepen what he has called 21st-century socialism — a mix of state interventions in the economy, including expropriations of private companies, and an activist foreign policy that seeks to use alliances with countries such as Cuba and Iran to counter U.S. objectives.At a news conference Monday afternoon, Diosdado Cabello, who fought alongside Chavez in a failed 1992 army rebellion and is now president of the National Assembly, noted that Chavez had bettered Capriles by more than 1.5 million votes.“That’s not just anything,” he said. “We are very happy that the revolution is going to continue for another six years.”In a polarized country in which the government and its opponents represent two completely different economic and social models, disagreements over Chavez’s plans are likely to lead to pitched political battles.Indeed, Capriles stressed that the president needed to take into account that Sunday’s vote showed that a sizable percentage of Venezuelans remain opposed to his model.“I would expect that a project that’s 14 years old understands that almost half of the country is not in agreement with the option that today has remained in power,” Capriles said. “From those in power, I ask for respect, consideration and recognition of nearly half of the country.”</td>\n",

       "      <td>LOMA LA LATA, Argentina — In a desertlike stretch of scrub grass and red buttes, oil companies are punching holes in the ground in search of what might be one of the biggest recent discoveries in the Americas: enough gas and oil to make a country known for beef and the tango an important energy player.The environment is challenging, with resources trapped deep in shale rock. But technological breakthroughs coupled with a feverish quest for the next major find are unlocking the door to oil and natural gas riches here and in several other countries in the Americas not traditionally known as energy producers.That is quickly changing the dynamics of energy geopolitics in a way that had been unforeseen just a few years ago.From Canada to Colombia to Brazil, oil and gas production in the Western Hemisphere is booming, with the United States emerging less dependent on supplies from an unstable Middle East. Central to the new energy equation is the United States itself, which has ramped up production and is now churning out 1.7 million more barrels of oil and liquid fuel per day than in 2005.“There are new players and drivers in the world,” said Ruben Etcheverry, chief executive of Gas and Oil of Neuquen, a state-owned energy firm that is positioning itself to develop oil and gas fields here in Patagonia. “There is a new geopolitical shift, and those countries that never provided oil and gas can now do so. For the United States, there is a glimmer of the possibility of self-sufficiency.”Oil produced in Persian Gulf countries — notably Saudi Arabia, Iran, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait and Iraq — will remain vital to the world’s energy picture. But what was once a seemingly unalterable truth — that American oil production would steadily fall while the United States remained heavily reliant on Middle Eastern supplies — is being turned on its head.Since 2006, exports to the United States have fallen from all but one major member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, the net decline adding up to nearly 1.8 million barrels a day. Canada, Brazil and Colombia have increased exports to the United States by 700,000 barrels daily in that time and now provide nearly 3.4 million barrels a day.Six Persian Gulf suppliers provide just 22 percent of all U.S. imports, the nonpartisan U.S. Energy Information Administration said this month. The United States’ neighbors in the Western Hemisphere, meanwhile, provide more than half — a figure that has held steady for years because, as production has fallen in the oil powers of Venezuela and Mexico, it has gone up elsewhere.Production has risen strikingly fast in places such as the tar sands of Alberta, Canada, and the “tight” rock formations of North Dakota and Texas — basins with resources so hard to refine or reach that they were not considered economically viable until recently. Oil is gushing in once-dangerous regions of Colombia and far off the coast of Brazil, under thick salt beds thousands of feet below the surface.A host of new discoveries or rosy prospects for large deposits also has energy companies drilling in the Chukchi Sea inside the Arctic Circle, deep in the Amazon, along a potentially huge field off South America’s northeast shoulder, and in the roiling waters around the Falkland Islands.“A range of big possibilities for oil are opening up,” said Juan Carlos Montiel, as he directed a team from the state-controlled company YPF to drill while a whipping wind brought an autumn chill to the potentially lucrative fields here outside Añelo. “With the exploration that is being carried out, I think we will really increase the production of gas and oil.”Because oil is a widely traded commodity, analysts say the upsurge in production in the Americas does not mean the United States will be immune to price shocks. If Iran were to close off the Strait of Hormuz, stopping tanker traffic from Middle East suppliers, a price shock wave would be felt worldwide.But the new dynamics for the United States — an increasingly intertwined energy relationship with Canada and more reliance on Brazil — mean U.S. energy supplies are more assured than before, even if oil from an important Persian Gulf supplier is temporarily halted.The fracking ‘revolution’Perhaps the biggest development in the worldwide realignment is how the United States went from importing 60 percent of its liquid fuels in 2005 to 45 percent last year. The economic downturn in the United States, improvements in automobile efficiency and an increasing reliance on biofuels all played a role.But a major driver has been the use of hydraulic fracturing. By blasting water, chemicals and tiny artificial beads at high pressure into tight rock formations to make them porous, workers have increased oil production in North Dakota from a few thousand barrels a day a decade ago to nearly half a million barrels today.Conservative estimates are that oil and natural gas produced through “fracking,” as the process is better known, could amount to 3 million barrels a day by 2020.“We have a revolution here,” said Larry Goldstein, director of the Energy Policy Research Foundation in New York. “In 47 years in this business, I’ve never seen anything like this. This is the equivalent of a Category 5 hurricane.”All of this has happened as exports from Mexico and Venezuela have fallen in recent years, a trend analysts attribute to mismanagement and lack of investment at the state-owned oil industries in those countries. Even so, there is a possibility that new governments in Mexico and Venezuela — Mexico elects a new president July 1, and Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez has cancer — could open the energy industry to the private investment and expertise needed to boost production, analysts say.“There’s a lot of upside potential in Latin America that will boost the oil supply over the medium term,” said RoseAnne Franco, who analyzes exploration and production prospects in the region for the energy consultant Wood Mackenzie. “So it’s very positive.”Political elementsMuch of the exploration, though, will not be easy, cheap or, as in Argentina’s case, free of political pitfalls. Price controls on natural gas and import restrictions have made doing business in Argentina hard for energy companies. And last month, President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner’s populist government stunned oil markets by expropriating YPF, the biggest energy company here, from Spain’s Repsol.But the prize for energy companies is potentially huge. Repsol estimated this year that a cross section of the vast Dead Cow formation here in Neuquen province could hold nearly 23 billion barrels of gas and oil. That followed a U.S. Energy Information Administration report that said Argentina possibly has the third-largest shale gas resources after China and the United States.“All the top-of-the-line companies are here,” said Guillermo Coco, energy minister of Neuquen province, including ExxonMobil, Chevron and Royal Dutch Shell. Although only about 200 wells have been drilled, Coco said companies here talk of drilling 10,000 or more in the next 15 years.Wells on the horizonOn a recent day here in a dusty spot called Loma La Lata, German Perez oversaw a team of 30 technicians from the Houston-based oil- services giant Schlumberger as they prepared to frack a well.The operation was huge: Trucks lined up with revving generators. Giant containers brimmed with water. Hoses used for firing chemicals into wells littered the ground. Cranes hoisted huge bags of artificial sand into mixers. Then, 1,200-horsepower pumps blasted water, chemicals and sand nearly 9,000 feet into the earth. “This is a hard rock, so we create countless cracks and fissures, for the gas and oil to flow,” Perez said.Staring at the stark landscape, broken up here and there by oil rigs, Perez said he thought many companies would one day arrive in search of oil and gas. “The projections are pretty good,” he said. “In our case, we have been here a ye</td>\n",

       "      <td>BOGOTA, Colombia — Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez will undergo cancer surgery in Cuba for the third time in eight months as early as Monday, an indication that he may be facing an aggressive tumor that could spread throughout his body, oncologists and gastroenterologists say.In a country where Chavez makes all major decisions and pronouncements, details about his illness remain sketchy, with only the maximum leader revealing what he sees fit to disclose. But leading doctors who treat various forms of cancer, including those in the pelvic area where Chavez has been stricken, say the recent discovery of a one-inch formation points to a new, potentially critical stage for the president.“He is facing a delicate situation, one of great uncertainty and everything points to an aggressive tumor,” said Carlos Castro, a Colombian oncologist and scientific director of the Colombian League Against Cancer. “I wouldn’t be surprised if in a few months we hear about a small lesion elsewhere in his body, in a lung, or in the liver. That’s called metastasis.”Like Castro, Floriano Marchetti, a University of Miami professor who treats colon and rectal cancer, does not have direct knowledge of Chavez’s health. But Marchetti, too, has followed the president’s pronouncements about his fight with cancer, including the announcement last week that Cuban doctors would operate once more to remove what could be a malignant growth.“The guy had surgery, he had chemotherapy and less than a year later he is having the same problem in the same area,” Marchetti said, speaking by phone during a break in an operation he was conducting in Miami. “That obviously is a bad prognosticating indicator.”Facing reelection fightChavez, a 57-year-old leftist firebrand who has formed alliances with pariah nations ranging from Syria to Iran to Cuba, has been a political provocateur since he led a failed coup in 1992. But since June, questions about his health have dominated political discussions in oil-rich Venezuela.That was when Chavez announced on national television that he had undergone two operations in Cuba that removed a baseball-size tumor. He never publicly disclosed what kind of cancer he had, nor the site of the original tumor.The president later revealed that he had four chemotherapy sessions. He then pronounced himself cured of cancer and resumed a hard-driving campaign to secure victory in October’s presidential election, in which he faces a 39-year-old challenger, Henrique Capriles.But then Tuesday, Chavez said Cuban doctors had detected “a lesion” with a high probability of being cancerous in the same spot where the first tumor had been removed.On Thursday, his last full day in Venezuela before flying to Cuba, Chavez hosted an event for his staunch followers at a Caracas theater in which he described how Jesus Christ had come to him in a dream. “He told me, ‘Chavez, get up, it is not time to die, it is time to live,’ ” Chavez said.Chavez also sounded contemplative, saying he was “preparing for the worst.” Speaking of the lesion, he said that “the possibility that it is malignant is greater than it not being” malignant.Doctors consulted in Colombia, Venezuela and the United States say Chavez probably has a tumor and that it may have metastasized. The fact that a new growth appeared so soon after his chemotherapy was seen as a sign that it is a stubborn tumor.“It is a new growth from probably the same tumor that was treated before,” said Leon Lapco, a Miami-based kidney specialist who is president of the Venezuelan-American Medical Association. He said that there is “an extremely high possibility” that other cancerous cells “are already in there, at least some cells, some malignant cells.”The spread of the cancerous cell would depend on the type of tumor and the location, said Pedro Jose Greer Jr., a liver and digestive disease specialist in Miami.“Some tumors spread by lymph node,” said Greer, who is also a professor at Florida International University’s medical school. “Those that spread by blood will end up in the liver and in the lungs. And some spread locally,” meaning they invade tissues adjacent to the tumor.‘I will return’Judging from what Chavez has said about his illness, his tumor could be in the bladder, the rectum or the colon, said Marchetti, the Miami doctor who treats rectal and colon cancer.“Particularly, for colo-rectal cancers, 80 percent of the tumor recurs within the first two years after treatment,” Marchetti said. “The bottom line is that whatever it is, it’s a problem because now it’s back.”Marchetti said the operation Chavez faces in Cuba, along with radiation therapy or chemotherapy, will be challenging for his medical team. “The cancer stepped up the fight, and now you have to come up with better forms of treating it,” Marchetti said. “Otherwise there will be no hope.”Chavez, though, is planning to govern from Cuba while planning his return to Venezuela to resume campaigning for a new six-year term to extend his presidency until 2019. “I will return as I always return — with more energy, more enthusiasm and more happiness,” Chavez wrote in a letter to the National Assembly last week.Specialists such as Douglas Leon Natera, a surgeon and urologist in Caracas who is president of the Venezuelan Medical Federation, said the president’s condition calls for him to set aside governing for now. “He wants to transmit a show of strength to all of Venezuela’s people, followers or not, so they believe that he is full of vigor and can continue governing,” Natera said. “You are left with the impression that what predominates is politics over his own health.”</td>\n",

       "      <td>CARACAS, Venezuela – As President Hugo Chavez battles a cancer that has sidelined him for much of the past year, a group of loyal associates has stepped into the spotlight, sparking speculation across a polarized political landscape over who could replace the fiery leader should his condition force him from office.With Chavez running for reelection in October, public talk of relinquishing power is unthinkable in his inner sanctum, where the mantra is “with Chavez everything, without Chavez nothing.” But the uncertainty created by his condition is trumping his efforts to tamp down talk of succession, say those who have had conversations with people in the upper echelon of the populist government.“There are two things they talk about: how the opposition is doing and whether it is growing, and they talk about how sick the chief is and who would replace him,” said Eduardo Semtei, a former government official who had befriended Chavez’s elder brother, Adan, and worked closely with other top officials.Chavez, a messiah-like leader who has amassed broad powers in 13 years of rule, has tried to dispel rumors that his condition would stop him from campaigning, let alone ruling this oil-rich country. This week, he dominated the airwaves, giving three long, rambling speeches spiced with warnings about Western imperialism and American-style capitalism. The appearances began Monday, when he sang folk songs and gave a thunderous speech after registering for his fourth presidential campaign since 1998.He told the crowd that while the opposition was engaged in a “psychological war” by raising questions about his purported successor, his ministers have been focused on ensuring that the government is running smoothly.“They have deployed and demonstrated that there is a collective government here, an efficient government, a government of the people and for the people,” he said.Chavez’s inner circleThe president’s assertions of normalcy aside, Venezuelans have been engrossed in the drama playing out in government circles behind closed doors – discussions over what direction Chavez’s so-called revolution would take should failing health force the maximum leader to cede power and anoint a successor.A handful of the president’s closest aides – as well as his brother Adan and one of his daughters, Rosa Virginia – have become increasingly visible as Chavez has struggled through three surgeries, chemotherapy, radiation therapy and weeks of convalescence in Cuba.Among them is Diosdado Cabello, whose name means “God-given hair.” A beefy former soldier, Cabello participated with Chavez in a failed and bloody military uprising in 1992 against President Carlos Andres Perez, landing the two of them and several other officers in jail.Cabello, though, is best remembered for his allegiance a decade ago, when Chavez was briefly ousted in a 48-hour coup. Cabello was vice president and became the de facto president, feverishly planning Chavez’s successful return to power from an ornate meeting room in the presidential palace.“Diosdado Cabello is one of Chavez’s centaurs,” said Luis Alberto Butto, a former army lieutenant and university professor who has written extensively about the military influence in Chavez’s government. “When they had to cross the desert, they did it together. Later, they have shared the fruits of power, together. This makes one think that Diosdado Cabello’s strength inside the party is nothing trivial.”Chavez rewards that kind of loyalty: Cabello is now president of the National Assembly as well as a pivotal leader in the president’s all-powerful United Socialist Party.More popular with the public are two longtime cabinet members, Vice President Elias Jaua, a former student radical who has built important links with rural groups, and Nicolas Maduro, who as foreign minister has energetically hopscotched the globe. Maduro is also well regarded by Cuba’s communist government, Venezuela’s closest ally and has been at the president’s side in recent months.“Some see that as a sign that he’s being groomed as a successor, that he has Chavez’s ear as things move forward,” said George Ciccariello-Maher, a Drexel University professor whose upcoming book, “We Created Him,” explores Venezuelan social movements and Chavez’s rise.Semtei, who was part of the movement that helped Chavez consolidate power, said the president might be moved to go with family.Adan Chavez introduced a young Hugo Chavez, then more interested in baseball than revolution, to radical political thought and Marxist guerrillas. He has also had close ties to the Castro brothers in Cuba, which has helped Venezuela improve its intelligence apparatus.Turning to familyThe president also has an option in his daughter Rosa Virginia, who frequently stands next to him during speeches and is married to the minister of science, Jorge Arreaza. The two were often with Chavez in Cuba in recent months as he received medical care.“The past shows us that presidents with so much power traditionally choose someone within their family, like Peron,” said Semtei, referring to Argentine strongman Juan Peron, who upon his 1974 death was succeeded by his wife, Isabel.None of those around Chavez, though, has his potent oratorical skills or his ability to connect with the poor masses, a challenge for the United Socialist Party should the president bow out.Indeed, many of those in his inner circle — including Cabello — have lost elections and fared poorly in polls when eligible voters were asked to pick between them and the opposition candidate, Henrique Capriles .“None of them has the leadership, the ability to project with the Venezuelan people with the magnitude, intensity and profound nature that Chavez can,” Butto said. “That is the misfortune and the dilemma for the party.”Some observers intimately familiar with Chavismo — as the president’s movement is known — say that if the president’s situation worsens markedly there could be chaos because Chavez himself may not name a successor. Under that line of thinking, a messiah-like leader cannot fathom leaving power, even with the end staring him in the face.“He will not cede power as long as he is alive,” said Chavez’s first defense minister, Raul Salazar, a former general who had once closely worked with the president. “He will take to the campaign in a wheelchair, on crutches, any way he can. The only thing that will stop him is death.” by Juan Forero CARACAS, Venezuela – As President Hugo Chavez battles a cancer that has sidelined him for much of the past year, a group of loyal associates has stepped into the spotlight, sparking speculation across a polarized political landscape over who could replace the fiery leader should his condition force him from office.With Chavez running for reelection in October, public talk of relinquishing power is unthinkable in his inner sanctum, where the mantra is “with Chavez everything, without Chavez nothing.” But the uncertainty created by his condition is trumping his efforts to tamp down talk of succession, say those who have had conversations with people in the upper echelon of the populist government.“There are two things they talk about: how the opposition is doing and whether it is growing, and they talk about how sick the chief is and who would replace him,” said Eduardo Semtei, a former government official who had befriended Chavez’s elder brother, Adan, and worked closely with other top officials.Chavez, a messiah-like leader who has amassed broad powers in 13 years of rule, has tried to dispel rumors that his condition would stop him from campaigning, let alone ruling this oil-rich country.

       "175   CARACAS, Venezuela — President Hugo Chavez, who has not been seen publicly in a month since undergoing a complex cancer surgery in Cuba, will not be back in Venezuela on Thursday to be sworn in for a fourth term, his government announced Tuesday.Vice President Nicolas Maduro said in a letter read on national television that Chavez would extend his “post-surgery recovery process beyond Jan. 10 of this year,” the date on which the constitution says the president should be inaugurated before the country’s legislature.“Because of this he will not be able to appear on that date before the National Assembly,” said the letter, which was read before lawmakers by the president of the assembly, Diosdado Cabello. The letter went on to say that the circumstances of Chavez’s absence trigger application of a constitutional article permitting him to take the oath at a later, undetermined date.The largely mysterious absence of the firebrand leader has created an increasingly tense political climate in this oil-rich country, with government opponents arguing that the constitution calls for an interim president to take over should Chavez be unable to continue in office. But the president’s supporters have argued that because Chavez was reelected in October, there is “continuity” from one term to the next, making the inauguration a mere formality.“We from the revolutionary bloc say to the president, ‘Take your time, so you can come back in good health to Venezuela,’?” Elvis Amoroso, a Chavez ally in the National Assembly, said soon after the letter from Maduro was read. “Your people are waiting for you.”With little information filtering out about Chavez’s health, however, many in Venezuela are wondering whether he will ever return. Since June 2011, Chavez has had four cancer surgeries, though Venezuelans still have not been told what kind of cancer he has, exactly where in his body the cancerous tissue was detected or what the prognosis for recovery is.Carlos Ayala, a Caracas-based constitutional lawyer, said that if the president cannot take office, then the head of the National Assembly, Cabello, would become the interim leader.Elections could be called, or Chavez could be sworn in later. But Ayala said that a medical board would have to be formed to publicly determine the state of Chavez’s health.“Everything would be cleared up if there were complete, honest information on Hugo Chavez’s health,” Ayala said. “The question is, why not follow the constitutional route?”

       "178   BOGOTA, Colombia — Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez’s revelation that Cuban doctors must remove a possible malignant tumor has thrown his drive for reelection into doubt, raising questions about whether a man famous for his stamina can withstand the rigors of a tough campaign.“In the coming weeks, unfortunately you will not see me, unfortunately I say it, and I say it with much pain,” Chavez said in a long phone interview with Venezuela’s main state television network that aired Tuesday night. “It’s the truth. I will not be able to continue at the same rhythm.”The disclosure, after months in which Chavez insisted that he was cancer-free, prompted Venezuelans to wonder Wednesday whether he would be able to sustain a high-energy campaign of the type that has characterized his rule over the past 13 years. Some political analysts even speculated that he might be forced to drop out, creating a power vacuum in a country where the president’s personality-based reign has meant there is no logical successor.“It creates a very complicated and uncertain political situation that I think helps the opposition in a really unprecedented way,” said Cynthia Arnson, director of the Latin America program at Washington’s Woodrow Wilson Center. “It’s Chavez and his personality and his charisma that have held his movement together.”The president’s delicate health returned to the headlines after Chavez said he will soon return to Cuba for surgery to remove what he called “a lesion” that could be malignant.“If it turns out to be malignant, well, that opens a new phase of radiation therapy that would be more focused,” Chavez said. “That will stop me, stop me, of course.”His comments in the phone interview, along with an earlier announcement Tuesday, come at a difficult time for the ailing 57-year-old leader. The populist firebrand, who delights in taunting the United States, is in his toughest of three reelection battles.This time, his opponent is a popular governor, Henrique Capriles, who has shown himself to be adept on the campaign trail. At just 39, Capriles presents an image of youth and vigor that stands in increasing contrast to the picture of a president hobbled by serious illness.On Feb. 12, more than 3 million voters turned out to overwhelmingly select Capriles as the opposition’s candidate for the October elections from a field of anti-Chavez foes. His emergence has flustered Chavez, who has referred to Capriles as “a low-life pig” and “the loser” and depicted him as a pawn of the United States.“The contrast between the two couldn’t be more dramatic: a young, telegenic Capriles against Chavez, who looks worse all the time,” Arnson said. “This can only help the opposition on the media front.”The president’s condition also highlights the inherent weakness of a government in which Chavez’s power is unrestricted and uncontested, said Demetrio Boersner, a political analyst in Caracas. “All the powers are concentrated in his hands, so if he’s out, then the whole system starts to weaken,” Boersner said.Boersner said that rivalries among Chavez’s associates could begin to percolate while the president’s followers question whether the movement would survive without him. “The people will be more realistic, evaluate the proposals from Capriles, consider the bad government of Chavez and the real situation in the country,” Boersner predicted.In Venezuela, the president’s health has been a state secret since Chavez announced last summer that doctors in Cuba had removed a baseball-size tumor from his pelvic region.The president later said he had recovered completely after four chemotherapy sessions that led to hair loss and caused his body to swell. But he never disclosed what kind of cancer he had or exactly where the tumor was located.On Tuesday, Chavez offered contradictory comments about his health.Earlier in the day, wearing a red hard hat and talking to state television during a factory visit, he said that there was “no metastasis” and that rumors of his ill health were being spread by his political enemies. “No one should be alarmed,” he said.But later, in the phone interview on state television, Chavez signaled that he might be out of sight for a few weeks.“I am obligated to attend to this new circumstance, to rethink my personal agenda, and take care of myself and confront what has to be confronted,” he said.Michael Pishvaian, an oncologist at Georgetown University’s Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center, said the new developments are “ominous.”“I think we can pretty safely say that this is a cancerous tumor that has recurred,” said Pishvaian, who has no direct knowledge of the case but has been following the turn of events in Venezuela. “Anytime there’s a local recurrence of a cancer, particularly after he’s had chemotherapy to kill residual cancer cells, it means that those cancer cells were resistant to the cancer therapy and are back.”Pishvaian said that after surgery, Chavez could undergo anywhere from 10 to 40 radiation therapy sessions over as many as six weeks. Those sessions can cause complications such as nausea, diarrhea and fatigue.The oncologist said that Chavez may be able to carry out some of his duties as president but that campaigning would be a challenge. “He may not be able to withstand the real rigor of a campaign,” Pishvaian said.In the phone interview, Chavez tried to sound upbeat while reflecting on his hopes for the future.“I ask for life,” he said, speaking to his followers. “I want to live with you and fight with you until the last moment of this life that God gave me.”More world news coverage:- Several killed in Koran-burning protests- IAEA concedes failure on Iran mission- Two Western journalists killed in Syria- Read more headlines from around the world                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",
       "475   CARACAS, Venezuela — Olga Fonseca was sent to Kenya on a mission she knew was difficult and possibly even dangerous. She was so worried about the assignment, according to her brother, that she had asked her relatives to go with her. None of them went.The career diplomat had been asked to take charge of the Venezuelan Embassy and fire all the remaining staff, he said. But less than two weeks later, on July 27, she was found dead in the ambassador’s residence in one of Nairobi’s ritziest neighborhoods. Her body was discovered in bed, underneath a blue sheet, and her hands were bound behind her back with sisal rope. Police said she had been strangled.The killing shocked Venezuelans, especially after Kenyan police charged the embassy’s first secretary with the death. Kenyan authorities say they suspect that Fonseca was the victim of a leadership battle at the embassy, but more than a month later, clear answers about the crime remain elusive. Neither the Venezuelan government nor the Kenyan police have explained how Fonseca ended up dead just days after arriving.Meanwhile, her killing has become a political issue back at home, as Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez faces the toughest reelection battle of his political life. His opponents have seized on the case to argue that Venezuela’s diplomatic corps is in shambles.Francisco Fonseca, an older brother of the dead diplomat, said he remembers clearly his last conversation with her at a going-away party a few days before she left for Kenya in mid-July.“She told me she was worried because what they had told her to do was go to Kenya to get rid of the entire staff and organize the embassy again with new staff,” he said. The experienced 57-year-old diplomat, who had last been director for Africa in the Foreign Ministry, was replacing Ambassador Gerardo Carrillo Silva, who had abruptly been relieved of his post.Fonseca’s brother said she didn’t explain why she was instructed to fire employees at the embassy. But in retrospect, he said, her concerns may have been linked to news reports that some Kenyan employees had accused Carrillo of sexual harassment.Carrillo has denied those accusations, telling the Venezuelan newspaper Ultimas Noticias that the Foreign Ministry called him home in May and suspended him from his post without explanation.The spotlight has now focused on Dwight Sagaray, the first secretary charged with Fonseca’s killing.Sagaray, a 35-year-old lawyer, has sat in a Nairobi jail ever since he was arrested, just hours after an embassy worker discovered Fonseca’s body. There was a little blood in the sitting room downstairs, which police said suggested that there might have been a scuffle. Also charged with murder is Mohamed Ahmed Mohamed Hassan, a doctor and friend of Sagaray’s who Kenyan prosecutors say is in hiding.Stephen Biko Ligunya, who is Sagaray’s attorney, said his client was falsely accused. He said that the prosecution is describing the motive behind the killing as a power struggle between Fonseca and Sagaray. — Associated Press

       "511   Some Venezuelans cannot get enough of Nelson Bocaranda, a mild-mannered radio reporter and gossip columnist who has been dishing up inside information on President Hugo Chavez’s cancer.While the government has said little about the president’s ordeal, Bocaranda’s dribs and drabs, via Twitter, a Web site and a newspaper column, have revealed major developments. That has infuriated officials who say the author of the “Murmurs” column in El Universal is destabilizing the country ahead of an October presidential election that Chavez has vowed to win despite his illness.“Despicable rat,” Mario Silva, the caustic host of “The Razor” on state television, said of Bocaranda.“Perhaps someone pays him to write his lies?” asked Diosdado Cabello, the president of the National Assembly.Andres Izarra, the government’s information minister, called Bocaranda’s revelations part of a “psychological war, a war of rumors,” and said that Chavez has dealt with the situation “with total transparency.”And to a degree, the president has, telling the nation he had a tumor removed in June in Cuba, followed by chemotherapy. Chavez also announced he had been cured of cancer — until a recurrence sent him back to Cuba for a third surgery that took place on Feb. 26.On Friday, 19 days later, Chavez returned to Venezuela, sounding optimistic about a future that includes a challenging reelection campaign against a young and spirited opposition candidate, Henrique Capriles.“I am going to live, we are going to live, we are going to continue to overcome,” said Chavez, 57, in a half-hour address televised nationwide.Bocaranda, though, said the government has revealed little, noting that Chavez still has not said what kind of tumor he had or where it was located. He said the president’s health is fair game, explaining that Chavez is an omnipresent figure who controls all Venezuelan institutions.“This is a man who is the whole government, the man who has the whole congress, the whole supreme court, everything, all the powers,” Bocaranda, 66, who wears heavy glasses and slicks his gray hair back, said in an interview after his nightly radio show. “I think that is why his health is most important for us.”With only Chavez himself releasing information about his cancer, the country has become rife with rumors as Venezuelans argue over whether the president will be able to carry out a grueling campaign schedule.“I think this is classic,” said Luis Vicente Leon, a pollster and political analyst. “When a society faces a vacuum of information over an issue that is relevant, then it fills the vacuum with rumors.”In one of the president’s strongholds — a vast neighborhood of towering apartment blocks called 23 of January for the date in 1958 when Venezuela’s last dictator was ousted — residents on a recent day drank beer at an open-air restaurant and argued over how the president should handle his privacy vs. the public’s need to know.“The president’s health worries everyone and more so because he’s the top leader, the No. 1 authority,” said Felix Garcia, a former sportswriter who, like many here, is on a state payroll. “Still, I think, there is a privacy issue, privacy for anyone, even Chavez.”Celia Fernandez, relaxing with Garcia, quickly chimed in: “But he is a public figure, the primary leader, and the people he represents need more information.”And to get some of that information, some say, they closely read Bocaranda.In June, he was the first to reveal that Chavez had cancer, which the president confirmed days later in a dramatic televised speech. Then, in the early morning hours of Feb. 20, Bocaranda issued a series of tweets reporting a recurrence of cancer, which Chavez confirmed the next day.That last scoop generated 80,000 more followers to @NelsonBocaranda, where he now has nearly 570,000 readers.Bocaranda said he uses five phones and 10 SIM cards, as well as his BlackBerry, e-mail and old-fashioned shoe-leather reporting, to collect information from sources. He has said his sources are in Cuba and suggested some are close to the president.Walking into a restaurant on a recent weekend night, Bocaranda was mobbed by diners who wanted to shake his hand and have their pictures taken with him.“He’s like a rock star,” said Mariela Celis, who co-hosts “The Happy Traffic Jam” on Union Radio with Bocaranda. “He has to say hello to people at 10 tables and the waiters and the head waiter. And everyone then asks, ‘Hey what do you know? How’s Chavez? How’s this going to turn out?’ ”Indeed, moments after shaking Bocaranda’s hand, one loyal reader, Manases Capriles, 42, a lawyer, said, “He is the minister of information, working in the shadows. He is the official voice of Venezuela.”His friend Fidel Montanez, 41, also a lawyer, said that “while the government works at disinformation, it is through Nelson Bocaranda that you get to know the truth.”With Venezuela’s government facing a raft of crises, from an oil spill that polluted drinking water to divisions within Chavez’s Socialist Party, the president on the surface appears to be facing a taxing year.That is not lost on his challenger in the upcoming election, Henrique Capriles, who on Thursday appeared to defy Chavez to keep up with him. “Where will I take advantage? What is my strength? Running around the country,” said Capriles, 39, who plays up his hobbies of basketball and long-distance running.Chavez, meanwhile, said in a Saturday speech that he will undergo radiation therapy, which may slow his normally feverish pace on the campaign trail.Even so, the president remains formidable, controlling a large media apparatus and using his considerable charm to appeal to voters on television, said Leon, the analyst. “It is not the same,” Leon said, “but the truth is that for Chavez, it is not as necessary to tour the country as it is for Capriles.”Upon his return to Caracas, Chavez declared his operation a success and said he came home with an “indomitable strength, a celestial strength, a strength that is more than human.”But recounting a conversation with Fidel Castro, whom he considers a father figure, Chavez said he had to be focused on his recuperation.“He told me, ‘Chavez, I know you. Tell your people that you have to be disciplined. They will understand, so no one thinks this has passed,’ ” Chavez said. “We are overcoming, but we need to be rigorously disciplined.”More headlines from around the world:- Two blasts hit security targets in Syrian capital- Sadr’s militia hands over U.S. citizen- In Israel, prospect of war with Iran raises questions about defense- Read more headlines from around the world                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",
       "692   CARACAS, Venezuela — It’s become a well-worn routine here: A news flash about President Hugo Chavez’s battle with cancer is issued, invariably delivered with great fanfare but scant details.But what is increasingly troubling Venezuelans is not just the lack of candor that envelops the president’s condition, but that the news just as often comes from Cuba as it does from government ministries in Caracas. To protest what they call Cuban meddling, university students have chained themselves together in front of the Cuban embassy, and a growing chorus of opposition leaders charge that the Cuban government is calling the shots when it comes to Chavez’s health care.Amid rising tensions over the state’s secrecy, the government issued pictures of Chavez last week, the first time he had been seen publicly in 67 days. In the photos, Chavez is smiling and holding up a copy of Cuba’s state newspaper, Granma, from a hospital bed in Cuba.And just a few days before, revolutionary icon Fidel Castro — whom Chavez has called a father figure and a saint — offered more details than Venezuelan officials had by reporting that he received updates on the Venezuelan leader’s health “every day” and that Cuba’s most famous patient “is recovering.”“Ironically, Fidel Castro knows more about our president than the Venezuelans do,” quipped Federica Romer, 19, a university student who has been among those protesting outside the embassy.For some here, it is a sign that the small, poor island nation has an outsized role in Venezuelan affairs. It’s a role that seems to have grown since June 2011, when Chavez, speaking on national television from Havana, first revealed that he had undergone surgery on the island to remove a tumor.“I have to tell you that my indignation grows every day,” said Adicea Castillo, 75, an economist who helped topple Venezuela’s last dictatorship in 1958 and said she was once supportive of Fidel Castro. “It’s outrageous to see a government and a president so beholden in this way to Cuba.”Drawing closer togetherCuba’s influence on Venezuela is well known here. Over Chavez’s 14 years in power, Cuba has sent sports trainers and doctors to Venezuela’s poor barrios and provided intelligence agents to this country’s military. Venezuela has reciprocated with 100,000 barrels of oil a day at cut-rate prices, an economic lifeline that analysts say has helped keep the Castro regime afloat.Chavez’s government has also worked tirelessly for Cuba to be accepted by other Latin American countries, an effort that paid off last month when President Raul Castro assumed the presidency of a 14-month-old regional bloc called the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States.But Chavez’s cancer has drawn the two countries even closer, with the president spending more and more time in Havana as doctors grapple with a tumor that appears to have fended off four surgeries, chemotherapy and radiation treatments.Indeed, Chavez was last seen in Venezuela on Dec. 10, when he boarded an early-morning flight to Havana. He missed his Jan. 10 swearing-in for a fourth term and, until photographs of him were released Friday, no one aside from a small cabal of aides and family members knew for sure whether he was even alive.What Venezuelans do know is that the country’s top leaders have taken to flying constantly to Cuba to meet with Chavez. Those associates say Chavez has provided them with detailed instructions on running the state.But critics say that Chavez has been in no condition to govern and that Cuba’s government is helping plot Venezuela’s course.“What’s happening in Venezuela has no precedent in our history,” said Maria Corina Machado, an outspoken anti-Chavez lawmaker. “For the first time in 200 years of republican history, the decisions regarding the destiny of our country are being taken abroad.”Such accusations have angered Venezuelan officials, who call the relationship with Cuba “a brotherhood” based on mutual respect.But the government’s annoyance at the criticism has done little to curb growing resentment among some Venezuelans.‘A great uncertainty’In recent days, university students have chained themselves outside the Cuban embassy, which has drawn other protesters angry about Chavez’s long sojourn in Havana. With a phalanx of National Guard troops protecting the embassy, the students have been sleeping on cushions and blankets in the middle of the street.They say they won’t leave until they have clear answers about the president’s health.For the protesters, the photographs issued by Chavez’s aides proved nothing. They noted that the government still has not said what kind of cancer Chavez has nor revealed details about his prognosis or whether he will even return to Caracas.“We Venezuelans are living a great uncertainty, really, because we don’t know the truth,” said Gustavo Frias, 23, who spent the weekend at the embassy with other students. “We don’t know how the president is, if he’s fine, if he’s alive, if he’s dead. The truth is what we want to know.”Emilia Diaz-Struck contributed to this report.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",
       "837   Displaying youthful vigor, Henrique Capriles sprang from his campaign van in the center of this farm-belt town on a recent day, leading his followers on a sprint along narrow streets.Teenage girls mobbed him, mothers wanted to talk about better schools, and unemployed workers asked about jobs. And some even told him: You look like Hugo Chavez did in 1998, the way you energize your followers.It is not a comparison the presidential hopeful easily casts aside as Venezuela’s campaign season kicks into gear. When Chavez came on the political scene as a trim, 44-year-old former army paratrooper, his fresh face and revolutionary ideas made him a viable alternative to the established order. He won big.Now Capriles, who has a wiry athletic build and is 39, is offering a similar break — not only from the aging opposition politicians who came from the two-party system Chavez replaced but also from the president himself.“I think the government is tired,” Capriles said in an interview in the midst of his campaign here. “It’s a government that talks and talks, promises and promises, but you cannot live on that. It is 14 years in power. We have to close the cycle.”Capriles faces an uphill battle, but polls released late last year showed him closer to the president than any other politician who has challenged Chavez. On Sunday, Capriles is expected to emerge from a field of five opposition leaders in a first-ever primary designed to choose one strong candidate who could end Chavez’s long rule in October’s presidential election, according to the Caracas-based pollster Datanalisis.The very fact that a primary is taking place — one in which various parties are represented — demonstrates how a once-fractured opposition has united, political analysts say. Aside from Capriles, two other candidates are younger than 45 and come with new ideas that make it difficult for Chavez to characterize them as part of the old, corrupt order that he smashed in his rise to power.“There was once no unity. There were centrifugal forces but no structure,” said Ramon Guillermo Aveledo, the head of the United Democratic Platform, an anti-Chavez coalition that is organizing the primary. “We have advanced strongly and are now more coherent and more consistent, with a clearer message than before.”Chavez’s recuperationThe primary arrives after a year in which Chavez underwent delicate surgery in Cuba to remove a cancerous tumor. Four chemotherapy sessions followed, leaving him temporarily bald. Chavez says he has recovered, though he has not provided a detailed medical prognosis or disclosed what kind of tumor he had.But since October, his activities have picked up, first with phone calls to state television and later with appearances. He has hosted summits of Latin American leaders, returned to his role as host and central guest of his Sunday television show and joshed around with visitors such as Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.“The management of his health problems has been brilliant,” said Carlos Romero, a political scientist here. “Some people spoke of the possibility of a transition because President Chavez only had a few remaining days left. But six or seven months have passed, and Chavez is not only recuperating his health but also he is recuperating his leadership.”Luis Vicente Leon of Datanalisis said Chavez’s approval rating rose from just above 50 percent in the middle of last year to 56 percent in December and has since inched up more. At the same time, Leon said, the government’s oil-fueled spending machine is in high gear as officials try to build homes for the homeless and start up programs to provide loans for everything from refrigerators to cars.Javier Corrales, co-author of a recent book on Chavez, “Dragon in the Tropics,” said that central to the government’s message is that Chavez is indispensable as leader of the so-called Bolivarian revolution, a man so vital that it would mean chaos if he were to be replaced. Chavez has frequently said he hopes to rule until 2031.Chavez has also worked to solidify his base by promoting hard-line associates — some of whom participated with him in the failed 1992 coup that brought him recognition — to top government posts. They include Gen. Henry Rangel Silva as defense minister, even though U.S. officials accuse him of assisting Colombia’s drug-trafficking guerrillas.Their arrival heralds what will probably be an increasingly bruising campaign season.“They are wolves in sheep’s clothing,” Diosdado Cabello, recently named to head the National Assembly, said in a televised interview Sunday in talking about the president’s foes. “Their proposals are against the people.”‘Vote for the best leader’In a five-hour event he hosted last week in a theater in a poor Caracas neighborhood, Chavez reminded his followers that past leaders provided “hunger, misery, lead and death.”“We’ll never go back. The retrogrades can forget it!” Chavez said, using a new put-down for his foes. “That’s a new way of calling the bourgeoisie, the ones who want to go back to the past. I call them retrogrades, and they will be called retrogrades forever.”Still, the president has yet to face an electoral challenge quite like the one being mounted by Capriles, a former mayor and now the popular governor of Miranda state.Polls show that Venezuelans are increasingly dissatisfied with the government’s handling of rampant crime, rising prices, substandard housing and other issues.Such discontent helped opponents sweep into Congress in 2010 elections and also turn back a referendum that would have handed Chavez more powers. Those same concerns over Venezuela’s deep problems are giving ammunition to Capriles, who avoids direct criticism of Chavez and characterizes himself as a left-of-center progressive similar to former Brazilian leader Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva.“You have to vote for the best leader, the one who will provide the best opportunity for changing the country,” Capriles said as he stopped for a moment during his campaign swing in Acarigua. Reporters thrust microphones in his direction, and Carmen Lucena, a 58-year-old hairdresser, tried to push through the crowd to hear him.She said that she was tired of the political polarization, which she blamed on Chavez, and that her children were having problems finding work.“Capriles represents a change for this country,” she said. “I have always admired Capriles, for his work and because he is young and well prepared.”More world news coverage:- Architect of Egypt’s NGO crackdown is Mubarak holdover- Russia says Assad wants dialogue- Syria resumes shelling of Homs- Read more headlines from around the world                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
       "1274  It was remarkable how many non-Cubans knew the Cuban national anthem well enough to sing along Monday as the flag was raised over the newly re-established embassy on 16th Street NW. Then they joined in the delirious shouts of “Viva Cuba!”But not so surprising really, when you grasp that for many of the several hundred packed into the diplomatic mansion and filling the sidewalk outside, seeing the red, white and blue banner with the single star flapping again in Washington was the culmination of a life’s work and a life’s wait.“It’s an amazing moment,” said Phyllis Bennis, a fellow with the progressive think tank, Institute for Policy Studies. “In the decades-long effort to normalize relations with Cuba, to stop the U.S. attacks and hostility toward Cuba, we have not had so many victories. Suddenly we have a victory. The flag going up — that’s huge.”[Mojitos on the house at the Cuban Embassy’s first party]So it was a victory party then, that mojito-soaked affair that followed the triumphant and somewhat defiant address by Cuba’s foreign minister, Bruno Rodríguez. And yet, for many people drinking before noon, the conversations were rather earnest and sober. That is the nature of these quixotic policy idealists who never gave up. They are so used to the patronizing impatience of the old Cold War realists, not to mention the outright hostility of the Cuba-haters, that their thoughts naturally channel into a hard-shell patois of heavily footnoted emotion.“For those of us who were committed to the values and the aspirations of the Cuban revolution, the flag, as Fidel said in April 1959 when he was in this building, was a reflection of Operation Truth,” said James Early, a Cuba specialist who recently retired from the Smithsonian. Raising that flag again “is a recognition of Cuba’s right to sovereignty and self-determination…and to more freely deal with its own internal self-criticism, its failures, its errors, in the context of its extraordinary achievements.”Peter Kornbluh, who runs the Cuba Documentation Project at the National Security Archive, was carrying around a book he co-authored, “Back Channel to Cuba,” about the twisted secret history of outreach between the nations.“I wouldn’t miss this for the world,” he said. “It’s a flag flying in the winds of change.”[Full diplomatic ties after five decades]Not that there wasn’t plenty unfiltered emotion. Standing near Bennis was Valerie Landau, daughter of the late documentary filmmaker and activist Saul Landau. The elder Landau spent the better part of his life working toward this moment, before cancer cut his work short in the middle of another documentary on Cuba, in 2013. Traveling with Castro through Cuba in the late 1960s, he memorably filmed the revolutionary leader shedding his uniform and playing baseball, shirtless, with peasants. At the embassy Monday, more than one veteran of the struggle for Cuban engagement choked up at the absence of Landau and his camera at such a milestone.“We’re continuing his work in our own way,” said Valerie Landau, who leads tours to Cuba and also works with the Cuban health ministry on education programs. “I think this is a real crossroads, and there’s going to be a lot of change in Cuba. Some of it at their own speed and choice, and some of it as a result of an avalanche of interest on the part of Americans who are hungry to know and see Cuba.”The limestone and marble mansion opened as the Cuban Embassy in 1919 and quickly established itself as a delightful society party venue. Diplomatic relations were broken in 1961, two years after Castro took power. The mansion was shuttered. It re-opened in 1977 as the Cuban Interests Section, parallel with a U.S. Interests Section in Havana. The move to have full-fledged embassies again came after President Obama and President Raúl Castro resolved in December to normalize relations.As they return to their place in Washington’s embassy society, the Cubans will have to learn from the Venezuelans or the British about efficient crowd management. Hundreds were stuck on the sidewalk in a slow-moving line under a Havana-harsh sun without the grace of a breeze from the Malecón. They amused themselves with inside jokes about life in Cuba.“This is Cuban style: always a long line!” one called out in Spanish. Everyone laughed.Code Pink provided entertainment with chants and signs that said, “Salsa sí! Embargo no!”The trade embargo and travel restrictions remain in effect unless Congress votes for a change.“I didn’t know if I’d live to see this day,” said Code Pink organizer Medea Benjamin, who lived in Cuba from 1979 to 1983.She said she was deported for being so outspoken — hence her “love-hate relationship” with Cuba. Lately it’s been more love. She leads large tours of activists to the island and is planning an upcoming teach-in in the city of Guantanamo against continued U.S. control of the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base.“We could learn so much from each other,” Benjamin said.Inside the embassy, actor Danny Glover drifted from room to room. A regular visitor, his ties to Cuba run so deep than when the remaining Cuban Five prisoners were released by the United States in December, one of the first phone calls made by their informal leader Gerardo Hernandez as a free man was to Glover.“I’m excited,” Glover said. “This is the beginning of another narrative….What’s happened in the last 54 years is an insult to our intelligence as human beings and citizens.”Glover found his way over to celebrated Cuban folk singer Silvio Rodríguez, who was one of the bold-faced names from the island included in the Cuban delegation.“There was a time when this confrontation [between the two nations] was so strong that many of us came to think that there was no remedy,” Rodríguez said in Spanish after posing for pictures with Glover and Benjamin. “One of the most curious things I realize today is that yes, there is a remedy. And that now we can begin to work in that direction.”The reception was liberally sprinkled with Democratic senators and members of Congress — bipartisan exception: Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) — some of whom have been toiling at reaching out to Cuba for as long and as hard as the activists and the policy wonks.“I’ve spent 25 years in Congress trying to change this policy,” said Rep. José Serrano (D-N.Y.), who hosted Castro in the Bronx in 1995, and was criticized for it by some. “We gave him a party at a place called Jimmy’s Bronx Café. People who went to that event are texting me now saying, ‘Don’t you feel vindicated?'”Soon it was time for everyone to head back into the blazing sun and the certain knowledge that some of the hardest work is yet to be done.The day before he died in 1895 in the war for independence against Spain, Cuban poet and nationalist José Martí wrote a letter to a friend. He said that he was risking his life for Cuban independence in order to prevent the United States from dominating the region.The wariness of Martí, as well as the poet’s admiration for the United States, were both cited by Rodríguez, the foreign minister, in his remarks at the embassy. You could look at the mojito party as, most of all, a celebration of the original vision of Martí, who imagined the nation where he was born and the one where he sojourned in exile co-existing as equals diplomatically, if not in military and economic might. Accepting the other’s flag, could be a starting point.“There was a war for 56 years, and the war is over,” said Philip J. Brenner, a professor in the School of International Service at American University. “Both Americans and Cubans won….Now the two countries can deal with their disagreements with mutual respect.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",
       "1751  “THIS REVOLUTION doesn’t just depend on one person,” Hugo Chavez told Venezuelans in a television address Saturday night. Sadly for Mr. Chavez, that claim may soon be tested. The 58-year-old caudillo, who has been suffering since early last year from an undisclosed form of cancer, has returned to Cuba for more surgery — and is sick enough to have named a successor in the event he is unable to remain in office.Mr. Chavez’s incapacitation could tip Venezuela, one of the largest U.S. oil suppliers, toward a prolonged period of turmoil or even violence. If so, it will be due not so much to his illness but to the breathtaking irresponsibility with which he has responded to it. Mr. Chavez did not tell Venezuelans he was ill until after he had already undergone at least one cancer surgery in Cuba; to this day he has not said what type of cancer he has or what his prognosis is. Twice he has declared himself fully cured, most recently when he launched this year a campaign for a new six-year term as president. Almost immediately after his victory in the Oct. 7 vote, Mr. Chavez disappeared from view — a strong indication that he deceived the millions of voters who supported him.Mr. Chavez is now saying that his longtime foreign minister, Nicolas Maduro, should succeed him. But he cannot appoint him to office: Venezuela’s constitution says that if the president dies or is forced to leave office, a new election for president must be held within 30 days. There is no guarantee that Mr. Chavez’s populist movement can hold together after his death or that Mr. Maduro could defeat a challenger from the Venezuelan opposition. Polls have consistently shown that the opposition candidate in the October election, Henrique Capriles Radonski, could defeat any government nominee except Mr. Chavez.Mr. Chavez has meanwhile ensured that whoever succeeds him will inherit a daunting mess. To win the election, the government spent wildly, running up a budget deficit of 20 percent of gross domestic product. The next president consequently will be forced to devalue the currency, giving a boost to inflation that is already in double digits and worsening already-severe shortages of consumer goods. That’s not to mention the tidal wave of violence that has overtaken the country: Venezuela’s murder rate is now one of the highest in the world.In 14 years in power, Mr. Chavez has thoroughly wrecked what was once Latin America’s richest country and one of its most enduring democracies. Now, thanks to his dishonesty about his health, he could create a vacuum in which Venezuelans have 30 days to decide on a leader to inherit the catastrophe he created.Read more on this issue:The

       "1765  On Feb. 12, Henrique Capriles Radonski, a 39-year-old Venezuelan state governor, won a primary election to become the opposition’s candidate against Hugo Chavez in October’s presidential election. He won 1.8 million of an astonishing 3 million votes — double the turnout predicted by most analysts.The next day, Capriles, a devout Catholic, was greeted by a commentary on the government-run Web site of Venezuelan National Radio titled “The Enemy Is Zionism.” Capriles, it explained, is the descendant of Jews. (In fact, his grandmother was a Holocaust survivor who emigrated from Poland to Venezuela.)“In order to understand the interests embodied” by Capriles, the commentary declared, “it’s important to know what is Zionism, the Israeli ideology that he sneakily represents. .?.?. It is, without doubt, an ideology of terror, of the most putrefied sentiments of humanity; its supposedly patriotic impetus is based in greed.” And so on.“Zionism,” it concludes, “is owner of the majority of the financial institutions of the planet, controls almost 80 percent of the world economy and virtually all of the communications industry, in addition to maintaining decision-making positions within the U.S. Department of State and European powers.”Thus began the latest — and what will surely be the ugliest — political campaign by Chavez, a ruler who has served as a friend in need to Moammar Gaddafi, Bashar al-Assad and Mahmoud Ahmadinejad — and who now is facing his own homegrown democratic uprising. But Venezuela’s spring differs from those of Libya, Syria or Iran: Instead of pouring into the streets, Venezuelans — fed up with the chaos and violence of Chavez’s 13 years in power — are marching to the polls and trying to restore the country’s crippled and compromised institutions.The opposition Capriles now heads has learned lessons that might benefit some of the revolutionaries of the Middle East. It tried and failed to oust Chavez with mass demonstrations and strikes; it foolishly boycotted elections it believed would be unfair; it indulged in endless internal quarrels. The result was the entrenchment of a strongman who has thoroughly wrecked what was once Latin America’s richest country and who now presides over the highest inflation and murder rates in the Western Hemisphere, shortages of basic goods and power, and a drug-trafficking industry whose kingpins include the defense minister.The opposition could have turned savage; instead it grew civil. Capriles, lanky and somewhat wonky, has insisted on pursuing power peacefully and by electoral means, even when the playing field is tilted. In 2004 Chavez jailed him on bogus charges; he won acquittal and in 2008 stunned Chavez’s hand-picked candidate for governor in Miranda, the populous state that surrounds Caracas. Now some pollsters are giving him even-money odds of beating Chavez himself, if the votes are counted fairly. His campaign has focused not on the caudillo but on the country — how he would begin to piece the economy and democratic institutions back together, while preserving social programs for the poor. His model, he says, is Brazil’s social democratic hero, former president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva.Chavez has responded by importing the rhetoric of the Holocaust-denying Ahmadinejad, whom he recently welcomed to Caracas. He has tried to seize the ballot papers from the opposition primary, probably in order to identify and punish those who participated; such an operation targeted signers of a 2004 recall petition.Meanwhile he is pouring borrowed money into the economy in a frantic effort to buy back support. The government budget calls for a 46 percent increase in spending this year. The state oil company borrowed $17.5 billion last year and is expected to sell another $12 billion to $15 billion in bonds. There is also a $30 billion credit line from China, to be paid back with discounted oil sometime in the future.For Chavez, the future beyond October may not matter much. Operated on for cancer in Cuba last June, he has never disclosed the details of his illness; more than one foreign report suggests that he suffers from an incurable malignancy. Photos of his puffy face are in keeping with reports from opposition sources that he is relying on massive steroid injections to keep himself upright between now and October.A lot of Venezuelans worry that one way or another, the country is headed for an implosion. A Capriles win could be contested by pro-Chavez generals; if Chavez wins and dies, a vacuum will open. Either way the economy will likely crash, once the pre-election spending binge ends.That’s why the very orderliness and moderation of Capriles and the opposition coalition are so striking. Theirs is not so much an ideological or partisan crusade as a desperate effort to restore a semblance of political and social order to a country that is unraveling — a grasp at the modernity they glimpse in Brazil and Chile.

       "1918  With his government increasingly isolated by sanctions and facing the U.S. Navy close to home, Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad flew Sunday to Venezuela to meet with a like-minded leader who shares his goal of challenging the United States, President Hugo Chavez.The arrival of Ahmadinejad in the Venezuelan capital, to be followed by a swing this week through Nicaragua, Cuba and Ecuador, allows Iran to show that it still has friends and economic partners despite sanctions designed to cripple its nuclear program. Back home, Iran’s currency, the rial, has steadily lost ground, buffeting importers, while tensions have risen over the country’s threats to close the Strait of Hormuz, through which 20 percent of the world’s crude oil supply passes.To be sure, in Chavez, Ahmadinejad has an enthusiastic supporter who has vocally backed Iran’s nuclear program, taken sides with Tehran against Israel and adhered to the Iranian government’s line that domestic critics of its policies are little more than CIA stooges.“What the empire does is make you laugh in its desperation to do something they will not be able to do: dominate the world,” Chavez said Sunday as he resumed his weekly television show, “Hello, Mr. President,” which had been suspended since June as he recovered from surgery to remove a cancerous tumor.“We are free,” said Chavez, who told viewers that he would meet with Ahmadinejad on Monday. “The people of Latin America will never again kneel, dominated by the imperial Yankee.”Before departing Tehran on Sunday morning, Ahmadinejad told the semiofficial Fars News Agency that strong ties with Latin America were vital toward “battling the hegemonic systems” of the United States and its European allies.“We will discuss the hegemonic system’s efforts to interfere in countries and establish its military presence there,” he told Fars, using language similar to that employed by Chavez to appeal to his most radicalized followers. Other Iranian officials also have cast the trip as a sign that sanctions had failed.Iran has not been isolated, Esmail Kowsari, a former general who serves on parliament’s national security and foreign policy committee, told Fars on Sunday. He added that “one of the signs is the expansion of trade between Iran and other countries, particularly the Latin American ones.”But Ecuador, Nicaragua and Cuba have small economies with little to offer Tehran as it searches for a tangible way to ease the impact of American sanctions. And Venezuela imports mainly from its neighbors while exporting oil, like Iran, a fellow member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries .Ahmadinejad is not visiting Brazil, the world’s sixth-largest economy, nor the bigger countries in the region, which have diverse economies but also pragmatic diplomatic and economic ties with the United States.“There are a handful of countries, including a small number of countries in Latin America, that have been willing to establish warm relations with the Iranian government because of shared objectives,” said Cynthia Arnson, director of the Latin America program at the Washington-based Woodrow Wilson Center, which has closely followed Iran’s diplomatic initiatives in the region. “Most of that agenda is driven by antipathy toward the United States and a desire to confront U.S. power.”The Obama administration has recently voiced concern about Iran’s efforts to increase its influence in the region.In a rare interview with a Venezuelan newspaper, El Universal, President Obama said in December: “It is up to the Venezuelan people to determine what they gain from a relationship with a country that violates universal human rights.”“Here in the Americas,” he added, “we take Iranian activities, including in Venezuela, very seriously and we will continue to monitor them.”Still, high-ranking administration officials have said that although Iran has made an effort to play a bigger role in the region, it has fallen short. Close diplomatic ties remain limited to Chavez, Cuba’s communist government and countries with little economic clout. Pledges by a cash-strapped Iran to build a range of big-ticket projects in the region, including factories, ports, refineries and dams, have failed to materialize.“We have no evidence that Iran’s efforts to enhance outreach to Latin America is gaining momentum,” a high-ranking Obama administration official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss the matter freely, said in a phone interview. “The record is lots of agreement on paper, little that follows through in terms of concrete results.”When it comes to Venezuela, though, it has not been for lack of trying.Chavez has visited Iran nine times since taking office in 1999, and Ahmadinejad has made five visits to Venezuela since 2005. Washington has been watching the budding relationship closely, taking what Obama told El Universal were “a number of significant and effective steps to indicate our concern to the Venezuelan government.”Those included the imposition of sanctions last year against Venezuela’s state-owned oil company after it shipped reformate, a gasoline blending component, to Iran. The Venezuelan Military Industries Co. also was sanctioned for dealings with Iran. Two years earlier, the U.S. Treasury imposed sanctions on the subsidiary of an Iranian bank in Venezuela, saying it was helping fund Iranian weapons development.Then, on Sunday, the State Department said Venezuela’s top diplomat in Miami, Consul General Livia Acosta, has been told that she must leave the country by Tuesday. No explanation was given. But in December, a documentary on the Spanish-language Univision network presented evidence supporting allegations that Acosta and officials from Iran and Cuba were plotting a cyberattack on the United States. Venezuela has not responded to the expulsion order.“We do pay attention,” the high-ranking U.S. official said. “And the United States has not hesitated to act when there’s evidence of Iranian malfeasance. And the bar is pretty low.”Correspondent Thomas Erdbrink in Tehran contributed to this report.More world news coverage:- Arab League extends Syria mission- Islamists secure lead in Egypt’s parliamentary elections- Tehran praises U.S. Navy rescue operation- Read more headlines from around the world                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",
       "1948  ‘To lead” and “to seduce” have a single root in the Latin language. They are intimately tied in Venezuela, as well. For all of President Hugo Chavez’s failures as a leader, he was a supremely successful politician, a brilliant beguiler.It is a testament to his seductive powers that after 14 tempestuous years of rule — two of them in the clutches of a devastating illness, which finally claimed his life Tuesday— he continues to have a near-mythical hold on the Venezuelan people. Even as the country crumbled around him, even as he leaves a legacy of ruin, the multitudes adore him. Irish journalist Rory Carroll has gone a long way to explaining this leader-seducer in a riveting expose, “Comandante.”Carroll covered Latin America for the Guardian from 2006 to 2012. While reporting on news of the region, he kept returning to his foothold in Caracas, ever more fascinated by the one-man phenomenon unfolding in the place he called home. Chavez was the big story — the only story. “He bestrode society like a colossus, commanding attention, everywhere his voice, his face, his name. It did not matter whether you despised or adored him; you looked. Covering Venezuela was like wandering through a vast, boisterous audience that simultaneously booed and cheered the titan who turned the presidential palace, Miraflores, into a stage.”“Comandante” traces Chavez’s single-minded rise to power, from a humble boyhood in the dusty town of Barinas through a meteoric trajectory in the army and, eventually, to his 1992 military coup attempt that landed him in prison and made him a national hero. But nowhere is Carroll’s portrait more fascinating than in his account of Chavez winning the presidency in 1999, his subsequent, ubiquitous presence on television and his careful fashioning of Chavismo — a ferocious brand of anti-capitalism with a folksy smile — a cult that is unique in the annals of Latin America.Chavez, Carroll takes pains to explain, was no dictator — he was a democratically elected head of state. Nevertheless, he managed to walk a fine line between pop hero and strongman. As Gabriel Garcia Marquez wrote after spending a day in his company: “I was overwhelmed by the feeling that I had just been .?.?. with two opposing men. One to whom the caprices of fate had given an opportunity to save his country. The other, an illusionist, who could pass into the history books as just another despot.” He was magnetic, funny and well-read, and he managed to convince the majority of his countrymen that things were getting better, even as the nation whirled into an abyss.It is that illusionist we get to know in “Comandante”: Here is a consummate performer, a president who projected himself alongside the image of Venezuela’s national hero, Simon Bolivar, then appropriated live television day after day for hours at a time, “mulling, musing, deciding, ordering.” He chatted up the man on the street, turned cameras on himself during palace conversations, worried over the price of milk with mothers, joked with hard-drinking laborers. “He would sing, dance, rap; ride a horse, a tank, a bicycle, aim a rifle, cradle a child, scowl, blow kisses; act the fool, the statesman, the patriarch.”At any given moment of the day, the figure of the president, with a bright, winning smile and a torso “of reinforced concrete,” would be seen flickering in the living rooms of Venezuela like some strange, Orwellian phantom. Eventually, “Hello, President” — a marathon Sunday program in which the chief executive wandered the streets of Caracas dispensing wisdom, history lessons and cash like a talk show host on steroids — “became like the lottery, everyone looking to get a job, a house, something” from a beneficent government. Never had a country been run like this. Never had Latin America had a leader who thought like Marx and dished like Oprah.Chavez called it a revolution.And a revolution it was. In the course of it, he upended the Venezuelan aristocracy — that old, corrupt, entrenched establishment of oil tycoons and beauty queens. He made the poor his cherished children. To keep firm control of his message, he abolished the ministries’ press offices and centralized the news.He renamed the country the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. He forged ties with Fidel Castro and shunted petro-dollars to Cuba. He nationalized Venezuela’s huge reserves of oil, gave away fortunes, created a new class of rich (merrily referred to as the Boligarchy), built miles of housing for the indigent and, when the bills came around, printed more money until the over-leveraged economy foundered. His goal, when all was said and done? To unite Latin America in a firm alliance of revolutionary republics that would serve as a bulwark against the United States.Firmly anti-American, fiercely populist, Chavez devoted his entire career to turning Venezuela upside down. For him, it was the darker races, the marginalized, the needy, who deserved the country’s riches. Carroll shows how Chavez’s shoddy understanding and willful manipulation of the economy rained misery on the very people he meant to save. We see, in this vivid narrative, a government that is Shakespearean in its failings. By 2000, one year after Chavez was installed, a campaign everyone could believe in — rout the corrupt! elevate the poor! invigorate the nation! — had produced a clone of Cuba’s faltering communist state. “Fatherland, socialism or death!” had replaced the old Venezuelan battle cry, “Patria o muerte!,” and Chavez made no secret that he would go to any length to see that things went his way.Little by little, there were defections. His most devoted lieutenants were increasingly discomfited by his shift to bellicosity, his tendency to oust any official who disagreed. By 2002, his massive and very public firing of government officials prompted a march on Miraflores Palace. What began as a protest turned into a full-blown coup and attendant massacre.State television showed none of it; the opposition’s channel broadcast live footage of the corpses and blood.When Chavez surrendered the palace and was shuttled off into captivity, it didn’t take long for his generals to bring him back. He returned to his presidential seat chastened, but not for long. Who was to say that the violence hadn’t been staged to smear an innocent president?By 2007, when Carroll was asking Chavez why he wanted to abolish term limits for himself but claimed to be aghast at officials who strove to become regional caudillos, all pretense appeared to be over. Chavez’s government now intently began eavesdropping on those it considered suspect. Threats were handed out to anyone who grumbled. As the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration was ushered out, cocaine dollars rushed in. A wave of unimaginable crime followed.There was more: Oil money had made it cheaper to import than to manufacture; cheaper to buy other countries’ food than to invest in agriculture. The poor were eating, but the country was suffering a dire anemia. And although it cost a Venezuelan a mere dollar to fill his automobile tank, inflation soared, topping the charts in the hemisphere. A Boligarch boasted that he had paid $25,000 for a watch; his female counterpart, as much for a party dress.By 2011, this faux economy fooled no one. The judicial system had been virtually shut down. The constitution had been rewritten. Disillusionment among officials was rampant. Protests erupted throughout the country, sometimes as many as 10 a day. The vision of Chavismo had slumped into disrepute, and Latin American presidents, even those who claimed to be Chavez’s friends, politely turned away and looked to Brazil for enlightenment.But to the Venezuelan poor, the president continued to be a beacon. For all the country’s problems, they insisted that his heart was in the right place. As a result, he swept the 2012 elections, his loyalists draping the streets with baffling banners: “Long live Chavez! Down with the government!”Carroll’s book ends b   \n",
       "1959  CARACAS, Venezuela — Angie Rivas grew up in a “Chavista” household, one so supportive of President Hugo Chavez that family members participated in the populist leader’s huge rallies and voted with the masses as he fended off challengers in one election after another.But Rivas, 25, is one of an increasing number of young Venezuelans who have grown tired of the rampant crime and moribund economy, the electrical blackouts and Chavez’s bombastic speeches. This group could be decisive in an election Sunday that will determine whether Chavez rules until the end of the decade.“I was only 11 when Chavez got into power,” said Rivas, who is campaigning for opposition leader Henrique Capriles. “But there are holes in the roads, you cannot find a job, there is crime and problems with health care and education. That’s because of 14 years in which the government hasn’t done anything.”In no other presidential election since Chavez’s first successful run in 1998 has he faced a tougher challenge — a vigorous 40-year-old former governor who, in a mad-dash campaign across hundreds of towns, has built a following by appealing to younger voters. Two recent polls put him roughly even with Chavez.“Young people, undoubtedly, may hold the key that decides this election,” said Juan Mijares, a Capriles campaign coordinator who tracks polling data.The two sides are fighting over an ever-expanding and politically energized segment of the population: the estimated 7.5 million Venezuelans between the ages of 18 and 30 who make up 40 percent of the electorate.In previous elections, the young had veered toward the government’s pledges to transform the country. But the Chavez of today is in many ways a far different man from the one who won by 26 percentage points in 2006 over a stodgy politician named Manuel Rosales.Now 58, Chavez is recovering from chemotherapy, radiation therapy and three operations that he said removed a cancerous tumor discovered 15 months ago in his pelvic area. That has left him bloated and moving gingerly.‘We were invisible’But political analysts say that Chavez is a ferocious campaigner and accomplished orator with a keen insight on how to reach voters, as evidenced by other polls that give him at least a 10-point lead over Capriles.And he has, since the beginning of his political life, adeptly cultivated the young. He created a Ministry for Youth, appointed young people to important positions in a sprawling public sector and hugs his daughters in public.“Viva the young people!” Chavez said in a speech before thousands of mostly young followers last week. “From the fight for independence until now, the best generation has been you, the young people of Venezuela of today! And so I say, fight hard to assure the future that will be in your hands.”To be sure, the president draws support from a multitude of young people in poor districts who believe that his policies of nationalizing private industry and spending Venezuela’s oil income on social programs give them possibilities they would otherwise not have had.“We were invisible, we were questioned, we were criminalized in the past,” said Ruben Loiza, 30, among the organizers of a group of artists, musicians and dancers supportive of the president. “We see Chavez, and we note how our families are thankful because those things that happened in the past are now taking place less and less.”On a recent day, a determined group of the president’s young supporters flooded a busy street, passing out fliers and posters with his image to motorists stuck in traffic.Taking a break from shouting slogans, Sony Sanchez, 27, rattled off various state programs — from subsidized markets to neighborhood medical care — that have benefited her family. She noted proudly that she is studying crisis management at a public university tied to the armed forces, for free.“I think this government has given opportunity to young people to realize their dreams,” she said. “Before, a young person couldn’t be sure of having a place in a university.”Still, that kind of solid support has dissipated as Venezuelan companies have closed and the economy has become ever more dependent on oil. The soaring homicide rate also is particularly worrisome to young people, since most of the victims and perpetrators are young men. Just Saturday, three Capriles campaign workers were killed in the rural state of Barinas in a confrontation with Chavez supporters, officials said.After the trouncing Chavez gave Rosales six years ago, in the opposition’s darkest hour, a group of university students rose up when the president pulled the plug on an opposition TV network and tried to push through a constitutional change that would broaden his powers. They held sit-ins and hunger strikes and organized lively street protests.Roberto Patiño, 23, who recently graduated from college, came of age during those protests. He said an increasing number of young people believe Chavez has become an autocrat whose policies are leading Venezuela to ruin.“Capriles represents the leadership of a team in which we have a role and something to give, where we are needed to build the Venezuela we want,” Patiño said. “On the other side, there is a messianic leader, where Chavez is the only leader.”Struggling to earn a livingGenny Zuniga, a sociologist who closely tracks economic data at the Catholic University in Caracas, the capital, said the country’s troubled economy and what she calls the poor prospects for young workers may drive younger voters to Capriles.She said 42 percent of the working population is in the informal sector, often selling food or clothes on the street, uninsured and without a pension or other benefits. Studies show that half of young adults have only nine years of schooling.“Here, to sell hamburgers at McDonald’s, they ask you for a high school degree,” Zuniga said.But she said that government interventions in private business are making things worse, asphyxiating the economy and making it unable to generate high-quality jobs, and that many young Venezuelans are simply leaving the country.“We don’t have a solid labor market,” she said, “nor do we have a working population that is improving itself.”Concern about the future is what has made Angie Rivas put her stock in a future with Capriles.“I think what Chavez had to give he’s given, and so I’m going to vote for progress,” she said. “A young person dreaming of the future with Chavez sees a future in another country. I think the Venezuelans deserve to dream about a future here in Venezuela.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
       "1966  CARACAS, Venezuela —Calling himself the “Son of Chavez,” Nicolas Maduro, the interim president, won a slim victory after a brief but nasty presidential campaign in which he had pledged to complete the socialist transformation of this oil-rich nation that began under the man he served loyally for 20 years, President Hugo Chavez.With nearly all the votes counted, electoral authorities said late Sunday evening that Maduro had taken 50.6 percent of the vote to just under 50 percent for Henrique Capriles, a youthful challenger who had only days to mount a campaign against a powerful and tested electoral machine.The vote in this country of 29 million came less than six weeks after Chavez, 58, died at a Caracas military hospital after a long battle with cancer. His death plunged his fervent followers into mourning and gave Maduro, who had been the vice president, the potent sympathy vote in a country where millions had come to view Chavez as a father figure who never failed to reward them with gifts. The victory gives Maduro a six-year term.Days before the vote, polls showed Maduro, 50, a former union activist with close connections to the Castro brothers in Cuba, holding a double-digit lead over Capriles, 40, a lawyer and governor. Capriles lost to Chavez in an October election, dispatched handily despite a long and hard-fought campaign, and his outlook for victory in the days after Chavez’s death appeared grim.But after running an intense campaign, Capriles closed the gap in recent days — leading to a near tie that the opposition may end up contesting. Maduro appeared to recognize that possibility as he spoke to a throng of supporters outside the presidential palace, just as his boss, Chavez, had after electoral victories.“Yesterday and today I said it — I win with one vote, I win. If I lose with one vote, I turn over [power] immediately,” he said. “The electoral authorities said what the people wanted.”The government’s media apparatus — which includes half a dozen TV stations, newspapers and dozens of community radio outlets — deified Chavez and reminded people that he had proclaimed Maduro as his political heir. Chavez exhorted Venezuelans in a Dec. 8 speech to vote for Maduro should Chavez have to give up power, and the clip was played repeatedly on television and at political rallies.Capriles’s aides complained that Maduro’s campaign was backed by the power of the state — from the military, which made sure voters got to the polls, to the various ministries of Venezuela’s large government, which ensured that hundreds of thousands of state workers voted for the ruling-party candidate.Maduro frequently warned that a vote for Capriles would be akin to treason — supporting a diabolical opposition of oligarchs and swindlers who would pillage the country with their masters from the United States, which the government here calls “the empire.”“These are the people of Chavez. This is Chavez’s place. Chavez continues as an example for us!” Maduro shouted in his closing address atop a stage over Bolivar Avenue in the center of Caracas, the spot where Chavez gave dozens of rousing speeches. “I am ensuring the legacy of my commander, Chavez, the eternal father.”Claudio Aguilera, 63, awoke Sunday as millions of other Chavez loyalists in the capital did, to the sound of pre-dawn bugles rousing them to make their way down from their small cinder-block homes scattered across hillsides to the voting stations.“Yes, I voted at 6 a.m., going for Chavismo,” he said, talking about the socialist movement that bears its founder’s name. “Who else would we vote for? We’re not going to vote for the empire and see everything fall apart.”Another Maduro supporter, Jean Leon, 30, spoke of how Chavez had transformed Venezuela for the better so that people like him in poor districts would have a voice.He said it is up to Maduro to fulfill that legacy. “I want to see Nicolas in that chair of our commander,” he said. “May he take that mandate we’re giving him and work the legacy that our commander, Chavez, left behind.”In middle-class neighborhoods of Caracas, though, voters spoke about a dysfunctional economy with the highest official inflation rate in the hemisphere, food shortages and constant power blackouts in provincial towns.Many also spoke about the rampant crime that has made Caracas one of the world’s most dangerous cities and state interventions in businesses that have made Venezuela more reliant than ever on its oil exports.Maria Blasini, 47, who said she was once mugged outside her house at lunchtime, said she thinks Venezuela has spiraled downward since Chavez was first elected in 1998.“We’ve had 14 years of the same thing — instead of making advances, we’re falling behind,” she said. “I voted because we want change. I want security and that the economy is reactivated, that the kids have a future.”Another pro-Capriles voter, lawyer Maria Sanchez, 40, said she wanted a new government that would end the deep-seated, sometimes violent polarization that was one of Chavez’s legacies. She also said the country will need a dramatic restructuring, something akin to President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s New Deal. And, Sanchez said, all Venezuelans must participate. “It won’t be the work of just one person,” she said.In the campaign, though, Maduro and the well-worn political machine that Chavez rode from one election victory to the next targeted the Chavez loyalists, from the hard-liners to those on the fence.Maduro and other aides frequently accused the opposition of crimes, from planning his assassination to sabotaging electrical power stations to make the government look incompetent. He did not provide proof.“Chavez was expert at polarizing in the campaign, because if the government can polarize, then it has the numbers to win,” said David Smilde, an analyst with the Washington Office on Latin America who has spent years in Venezuela researching Chavez’s revolution. But Chavez, he said, would soften up near the end of a campaign, when victory was assured.“Maduro hasn’t done that second part,” said Smilde, co-editor of the book “Venezuela’s Bolivarian Democracy.” “He’s been polarizing right through the end.”Although State Department officials said earlier this year that they had hoped Maduro would be open to improving tattered relations with the Obama administration, his campaign has frequently used the United States as a foil.On Monday, for instance, Maduro blamed the United States after television cameras filmed a band of government supporters beating and throwing rocks at pro-Capriles youths. Just minutes after images began airing, Maduro called the attack “a strange act of violence where a small, very violent group is involved, financed by the United States government.”Emilia Diaz-Struck contributed to this report.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",

But that's not all -- in his condolences for the former Venezuelan president, Ahmadinejad said he has “no doubt Chavez will return to Earth together with Jesus and the perfect” Imam Mahdi, the most revered figure of Shiite Muslims, according to AP.Ahmadinejad also said the three men will together “establish peace, justice and kindness” in the world, and that he is “suspicious” about the cause of Chavez’s cancer.Intriguingly, Ahmadinejad -- who had close ties with Chavez, and who has coined some colorful quotes before -- is not the only one speaking of Chavez in almost messianic terms.

       "2156  Across Latin America, the pope’s announcement that he will step down at the end of the month is drawing official comment as well as some speculation that the next pope could come from the region. Forty percent of all Catholics are in Latin America, and clergymen from Brazil, Mexico and Argentina are considered contenders for a church that is shrinking in Europe but growing in many developing countries.The president of the Episcopal Conference of Bishops in Venezuela said the move served “as a good example” for having shown that it is best to resign in the face of hobbling incapacity. In public comments, Archbishop Diego Padron also said the pope had the interest of the church and its renovation in mind. “The pope doesn’t usually give out news in pieces,” Padron said.It was not lost on Venezuelans that Padron’s message could have been as easily directed at President Hugo Chavez as to Venezuela’s Catholics. That’s because the ailing Chavez hasn’t been heard or seen by Venezuelans since undergoing a complicated cancer surgery in Cuba two months ago. Since then, the government has only released news on Chavez’s condition in dribs and drabs, delivering few hard facts about the president’s prognosis. That remains a state secret.Meanwhile, Venezuela has been embroiled in an institutional crisis as Chavez’s aides try to deal with a range of crises, from a prison riot that left dozens dead to shortages of toilet paper and milk to sky-high inflation and rampant crime. Chavez’s lieutenants claim Chavez remains in charge, but many Venezuelans do not believe them.The church has long been critical of Chavez’s autocratic rule. And the president has not had kind words for the church, calling the hierarchy in Venezuela “devil's investments.”“This is a luminous moment, a great lesson,” Padron said, speaking of the pope’s announcement. “The pope has been very human, has recognized that he no longer has strength and, with humility, has ended his services. He’s a good example.”Benedict's visit to Mexico in March 2012 is remembered for bringing consolation to a country torn by savage drug violence. Some of the country's criminal gangs even took a break from their murderous ways during his stay. Benedict held a large outdoor mass near the central Mexican city of Leon during the visit, donning a large black sombrero to the delight of the crowds.\"Pope Benedict XVI has always been a friend of Mexico and a messenger for peace and reconciliation,\" Mexican president Enrique Peña Nieto posted to his official Twitter account, offering the \"solidarity and respect of the Mexican government.\"Benedict's March 2012 trip also included a stop in Cuba, marking the first papal visit to the communist-run island since Pope John Paul II's groundbreaking 1998 voyage. Cardinal Jaime Ortega, the country's highest-ranking church official, said Benedict's decision to step down was \"a big surprise,\" but called it \"an invaluable lesson in humility.\"\"The Pope has broken once more with convention, and isn't afraid to tell the world he's too weak and tired to go on with the huge responsibility of governing the Catholic Church,\" Ortega said in a statement.

       "2187  CHUAO, Venezuela — It has been a week since Hugo Chavez’s landslide electoral victory — but that is not why the president’s supporters are still laughing in Chuao, a fishing village on Venezuela’s surf-pounded Atlantic coast.Last Sunday, in the general hilarity and excitement of the results, a carouser popped a wheelie by Chuao’s colonial-era 17th-century church and fell off his motorbike. When the gas tank ignited in the crash, the bystanders’ laughter soared into the night sky alongside the roaring flames.“At least the motorbike didn’t explode!” grinned Elvis Morillo, a burly Afro-Caribbean fisherman.Chuao is a “chavista” stronghold and also one of those semi-mythic Latin American towns that seem to leap from the pages of a novel. It is accessible only by boat, so that even the town’s new school bus had to be brought in by surfing it on the waves.Two hundred years ago, Simon Bolivar, the South American liberator and Chavez’s hero, passed a night of despair here — and, some say, contemplated suicide until the aroma of the cacao drying on the church patio lifted his spirits.Four years ago, Chavez used Chuao’s cobbled streets and palm-fringed bay as a backdrop for his “Al Presidente” television show. “Hello, Chuao!” he exclaimed at the start of the eight hour talk-a-thon, before declaring a series of new socialist projects.Such histories, old and new, make Chuao a folkloric microcosm of modern Venezuela. It is also why the town and its 3,000 inhabitants help illuminate why Chavez has been reelected president for another six years after what many consider 14 ruinous years in power.“Of course I voted for ‘mi presidente,’?” said fisherman Orlando Santana, while tying up at Chuao’s new stone wharf, built thanks to a $698,000 “revolutionary” reconstruction project, as a broken billboard nearby declares. “Why would I vote for anyone else?”However, Chavez’s political success owes less to revolutionary ideology than to a petrodollar-financed love affair with voters.Black gold flows through Venezuela, the Saudi Arabia of South America but with more oil reserves, and over the past decade Chavez has showered it on Venezuela’s poor. The flow has been immense: $1tn of revenues over the past decade. Yet as Chuao shows, Venezuelan history is replete with natural bounty abundantly displayed: It is Latin America’s traditional, some say pre-modern, way of doing things.Chuao’s ancient hacienda still grows a cacao so fine that chocolatiers, such as France’s Valhrona, consider it the “best in the world.” In colonial times, this “premiere cru” cacao turned Chuao into such a font of wealth — the oil gusher of its day — that it financed the first university in Caracas, a white neo-Gothic structure near the Plaza Bolivar.The education that Chuao provided then and that Chavez provides now — he has expanded university enrolment four times — can be a source of both personal self-advancement and revolutionary renewal, as Chavez so often says.Indeed, when the hacienda’s last owner, the pious Dona Catalina Mexia del Castillo died in 1669, she bequeathed Chuao to the slaves who worked there on the condition that they stayed and grew cacao.Which they did, so forging a distinctively rebellious local popular culture.At religious festivals, masked men dressed as laughing devils castigate onlookers while cackling with laughter. It’s a culture in keeping with a gauche brassiness that is peculiarly Venezuelan, and with which Chavez empathizes.“I’m also a devil. We’re all devils — good devils, because there are bad devils, too,” he had joked to his Chuao audience during his TV show.As elsewhere in Venezuela, not everyone is won over by Chavez’s demagoguery or folksy turns.“I voted for the opposition because I’m the only intelligent person here,” said Juan Velocidad, an overweight beach restaurateur.The waste and corruption of Chavez’s extravagant state-sponsored populism is huge. As they say in Caracas: “Any senior chavista who hasn’t made millions is a ‘huevon,’?” or fool. Yet with 300 billion barrels of oil reserves, worth more than $30 trillion at current prices, people’s lives have improved, and the government still enjoys a huge margin of error.That is just as well, because the 58-year-old Chavez, although he says he is cured of cancer, may have just begun a tricky transition by appointing Foreign Minister Nicolas Maduro, a street-sharp former union bus driver, as his vice president and eventual successor.Not that anyone in Chuao seems worried about such distant political concerns. Here, the smooth continuation of Chavez’s presidency has returned life to the way it was four months ago, before the election hysteria, which is why the burning motorcycle, for now, is the only news worth talking about.— Financial TimesMore world news coverage:- E.U. wins Nobel Prize- Chinese activist faces prison term for publishing environmental books- U.S. looks for solution to Mali crisis- Read more headlines from around the world                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",
       "2459  THE LATEST bizarre twist in the drama of Hugo Chavez unfolded Monday when the populist ruler returned to Venezuela in the dead of night after two months of incommunicado treatment in a Cuban military hospital. Apart from a couple of tweets, Mr. Chavez has yet to speak or show himself in Caracas, and it’s not clear if he has returned to rule or die. Either way, Mr. Chavez’s role as leader of the anti-democratic Latin American left appears to be up for grabs — and not for the first time, one of his acolytes is trying to fill the vacuum.That would be Rafael Correa, the 49-year-old president of Ecuador. On Sunday Mr. Correa claimed a landslide victory for a new term that will keep him in office until 2017, a decade after he first took power. Like Mr. Chavez’s own reelection in October, Mr. Correa’s was eased by a steeply tilted playing field. Following the Venezuelan caudillo, Mr. Correa won votes by spending billions in oil revenue in an unsustainable spree.And even more than Mr. Chavez, the Ecuadoran ruler strong-armed his country’s media into becoming his personal propaganda apparatus. Mr. Correa’s government, which inherited one radio station in 2007, now runs five television channels — including two confiscated from private owners — four radio stations, two newspapers and four magazines. If that were not enough, the president regularly employs a law allowing him to commandeer the national airwaves at any time of his choosing, for any purpose.Meanwhile, Mr. Correa has intimidated Ecuador’s independent media into virtual silence. Since May, the government closed 11 other radio stations that did not toe its line. A law forbidding biased reporting on political campaigns and allowing dissatisfied candidates to sue over alleged violations forced the media into pallid and skimpy coverage of the alternatives to Mr. Correa, according to a report by the Committee to Protect Journalists — even as government media blatantly ignored the rules.Journalists who try to oppose Mr. Correa are made to pay. A newsmagazine that urged voters to vote down a referendum giving the government still more control over the media was fined $80,000 for violating the law against electoral propaganda. Last year the Ecuadoran group Fundamedios recorded 173 “acts of aggression” against journalists, including one killing and 13 assaults.With reelection behind him, Mr. Correa clearly intends to step up this crusade. He is pressing yet another new law that would create a board to supervise media and impose fines and other punishment for alleged misdeeds. He’s also pushing the Organization of American States to neuter its independent rapporteur on press freedom, who, not surprisingly, has been critical of Ecuador.Mr. Correa’s defenders like to argue that he is more moderate than Mr. Chavez and unworthy of sanction by the United States — which continues to grant Ecuador free-trade privileges. When it comes to media freedom, that assessment is wrong.More on this debate:The Post’s View: Ecuador gambles on WikiLeaks founder AssangeThe Post’s View: Ecuador’s reasonable recourse to libelThe

       "2491  Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, who went from a young conspiratorial soldier who dreamed of revolution to the fiery anti-U.S. leader of one of the world’s great oil powers, died March 5 in Caracas of complications from an unspecified cancer in his pelvic area.He was 58 and had been president since 1999, longer than any other democratically elected leader in the Americas. Vice President Nicolas Maduro announced the death.Mr. Chavez first revealed in a brief, dramatic television address in June 2011 that he had undergone two surgical procedures in Cuba. He would go under the knife two more times, greatly weakening the once robust leader. Mr. Chavez had been elected in October 2012 to a third six-year term. But he missed his swearing-in ceremony on Jan. 10 while lying gravely ill in a Havana hospital after undergoing what his aides had called a complex operation a month before.(PHOTOS: The charismatic and omnipresent life of Hugo Chavez)The country was plunged into an institutional crisis, with Mr. Chavez’s foes accusing the government of violating the constitution. But Mr. Chavez’s lieutenants managed to buy time until their leader’s pre-dawn return to Venezuela on Feb. 18. He remained at a Caracas military hospital, with his Twitter account bursting out messages such as “Onward toward victory always!! We will live and we will triumph!!”As an obscure 37-year-old lieutenant colonel, Mr. Chavez had led a failed coup in 1992 against President Carlos Andres Perez’s government. Six years later, on Dec. 6, 1998, Mr. Chavez was elected president in a landslide after pledging to replace a broken, corrupt political system and redistribute the country’s substantial oil-fueled wealth.Mr. Chavez left Venezuela deeply polarized, his supporters lionizing him as a courageous rebel determined to take on the elites, and his foes painting him as a dangerous demagogue and strongman.The former army paratrooper promised a revolution and reveled in what he considered a battle to end all vestiges of the power structure then in place in Venezuela, especially its close economic and political ties to the United States.( TIMELINE: The life and rule of Hugo Chavez )Quickly moving to overturn the old order, Mr. Chavez marginalized the traditional power brokers who had held influence in Venezuela, attacked establishment institutions and upended the country’s economy.Combative in olive green uniform and red beret, Mr. Chavez called his opponents “degenerates” and “squealing pigs,” referred to the Catholic Church hierarchy as “devils in vestments” and labeled critics “counterrevolutionaries.”“Oligarchs tremble, because now is when the revolution is going forward,” he warned in 2000, after the constitution had been redrawn and a new legislature dominated by his allies had taken over. “This is going to be delicious; we’re going to deliver a knockout punch to the counterrevolution.”His guiding light was the 19th-century independence liberator Simon Bolivar, whose pronouncements, writings and philosophy found their way into nearly every speech Mr. Chavez gave.The new president renamed the country the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, and he labeled his philosophy Bolivarian. Mr. Chavez sought the unification of South America, reviving Bolivar’s unmet dream. He also called for a rejection of the so-called Washington Consensus, a policy that includes a drop in tariffs, adherence to tight spending, privatizations of state industries and other economic orthodoxy.A gifted, charismatic orator with a keen ability to connect with the poor masses, Mr. Chavez was able to marshal public backing for a series of referendums that created a new constitution and permitted him to bring every important institution — from the legislature to the state oil company — under his control.On the world stage, Mr. Chavez set Venezuela on a collision course with Washington, blaming American foreign policy and U.S.-style capitalism for much of Latin America’s social ills.( PHOTOS: Venezuelans react to death of Hugo Chavez )For an international left that was yearning for a passionate and magnetic leader, Mr. Chavez was a blessing.He criticized the U.S.-led invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan and, in a speech at the United Nations in 2006, said President George W. Bush was “the devil.” He called Tony Blair, then Britain’s prime minister, “an imperialist pawn who attempts to curry favor” with the Americans. He accused Israel of genocide, saying its treatment of the Palestinian people was akin to a “new Holocaust.”Mr. Chavez sought out relationships with assorted rebel groups, rogues and pariah governments. He exchanged letters with Ilich Ramirez Sanchez, a Venezuelan-born terrorist known as Carlos the Jackal, who was held in a French prison. He asserted that Moammar Gaddafi’s Libya was a model of participatory democracy.Closer to home, Mr. Chavez expressed affinity for the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, a potent guerrilla group fighting Colombia’s U.S.-friendly government. His closest aides built a close relationship with FARC commanders, according to Colombian officials, rebel documents seized in army raids and former rebels.Ties to Iran and CubaMr. Chavez particularly irked the United States by building a close alliance with Iran and Fidel Castro’s regime in Cuba, which found in Venezuela a deep- pocketed benefactor to replace the one the communist island lost with the breakup of the Soviet Union.After taking office, Mr. Chavez began providing 100,000 barrels of oil a day to Castro’s government at subsidized rates; in exchange, Castro shipped thousands of Cuban workers, from intelligence agents to doctors and sports trainers, to Venezuela.Drawing from the largest oil deposits in the world, Mr. Chavez embarked on a foreign policy in which oil, provided cheap to prospective allies, was freely used to help build an alliance to counter U.S. influence. In a grandiose plan to unite Latin America, Mr. Chavez formed an alliance he called ALBA, the Bolivarian Alliance for the People of Our America.He bought more than $2.5 billion in Argentine bonds, created a Bank of the South to counter Washington-based multilateral lenders and pledged to build a pipeline across the continent and construct housing, highways and oil refineries.Venezuela’s opaque financing, though, made it difficult to ascertain exactly how many projects were completed. And by 2012, many of Mr. Chavez’s most ambitious projects — a pipeline linking Venezuela to Argentina, the Bank of the South, a refinery in Brazil — had been quietly mothballed, as Venezuela’s economy struggled.Mr. Chavez enjoyed warm ties with most Latin American countries, but his ALBA bloc attracted as members only the anachronistic regime in Cuba and some of the poorest countries in the region, among them Nicaragua and Bolivia.Some officials who worked with Venezuela said they were put off by Mr. Chavez’s revolutionary, anti-U.S., anti-capitalist rhetoric.“His discourse was political, ideological, about the liberation of the Americas, of fighting the forces of imperialism,” said the former governor of Pernambuco state in Brazil’s northeast, Jarbas Vasconcelos, who had tried to obtain Venezuelan financing for an oil refinery. “He imagined commanding a revolution in all the Americas against the United States.”The young ChavezHugo Rafael Chavez Frias was born July 28, 1954, in the sparsely populated plains state of Barinas, the second of six sons of a couple who were teachers. He grew up poor and dreamed of playing major league baseball (he had a gift for pitching).Young Hugo had another passion: reading and listening to stories, his imagination fired by tales about the great battles and the prophetic words of the revolutionaries who had founded modern Venezuela.He had an influential tutor, Jose Esteban Ruiz, a leftist historian who introduced Hugo and his own sons to everything from Machiavelli to Jean Jacques Rousseau’s “The Social Contract.”“Put Marxism in your head, I t   \n",
       "2687  Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez arrived in Cuba in the early morning hours Monday to undergo his fourth cancer surgery in 18 months, after dramatically designating a successor in case his illness forces him to leave office after nearly 14 years.State television images showed Chavez hugging his close associates, including Vice President Nicolas Maduro, the man he says might replace him, before boarding a plane for Havana about 1 a.m.“Long live the fatherland,” Chavez said.One of his closest aides, Elias Jaua, later recounted in his Twitter feed how he had hugged Chavez. “I said, ‘Go and come back,’” Jaua wrote. “And he said, ‘Of course, I’ll be back, Elias.’ Amen!”In his struggle with cancer, Chavez, 58, has returned from treatment in Cuba several times already. But his announcement Saturday that “some malignant cells” had been detected in his pelvic region that would necessitate surgery in Havana’s Cimeq hospital, where he has been treated before, and his instructions that Maduro had his confidence and should take over if necessary, were sober reminders that his illness is proving hard to beat.“If something happens that sidelines me, which under the constitution requires a new presidential election, you should elect Nicolas Maduro as president,” Chavez said, sitting at a table with Maduro at his side. “I ask that of you from my heart.”Moises Naim, a former Venezuelan government official who is an analyst at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington, called the announcement “basically a farewell speech.”“He said goodbye to power,” Naim said. “It’s a statement full of resignation and appeals to God. There is no plan. The only talk of the future is that there will be elections, and he asks for people to vote for Maduro.”Chavez’s departure from office would mark the end of a tumultuous rule in which the leftist former army officer harnessed Venezuela’s considerable oil wealth to shower the poor with social programs while engineering a sharp diplomatic shift away from the country’s historical ally, the United States.Chavez’s government forged alliances with some of Washington’s most intransigent adversaries, including Cuba, Iran and Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. He has used his lock on practically all levers of power, from the courts to the congress, to push forward the nationalization of hundreds of private companies and the seizure of wide swaths of farmland.For Venezuela’s opposition, the possible scenarios that Chavez discussed in Saturday’s address amount to the first time the president has publicly acknowledged the severity of his illness and the impact it could have on the future of the country.No one in the government is authorized to discuss Chavez’s medical condition except Chavez himself, who astonished his countrymen in June 2011 by telling them he had gone under the knife twice to remove a malignant growth. A third surgery followed in February.Chavez has never disclosed what kind of cancer he has or where it is located. He has twice pronounced himself cured, without providing details.“It was time to tell the truth to the country,” said Maria Corina Machado, an opposition member of the National Assembly. “Venezuela has been living with a lot of uncertainty. In a democratic country where the constitution is obeyed, the president must talk about his health when it is compromised.”Should Chavez die or have to resign, the constitution calls for Venezuela to stage presidential elections within 30 days. Maduro, a 50-year-old former union organizer and bus driver who has risen through the ranks of Chavez’s movement, would become the candidate of the president’s United Socialist Party.The constitution also requires that the vice president fill in for the president should he be temporarily absent. Chavez has spent many weeks in Cuba in the past 18 months, undergoing chemotherapy and radiation treatments. But he has remained in charge of the government, signing decrees and bills from Havana.Machado said the opposition will call for a strict interpretation of the constitution now that Chavez has suggested the possibility of stepping aside.“Article 233 of the constitution is clear about the only mechanism, an election within 30 days,” she said. “He can’t name a successor. It’s the Venezuelan people who decide.”An election would mean a contest between Maduro and the opposition’s leader, Henrique Capriles.Capriles lost to Chavez in the presidential election held Oct. 7, with the incumbent winning 55 percent of the vote to the challenger’s 44 percent. Polls, though, have shown that Capriles is more popular in Venezuela than all of Chavez’s closest associates, including Maduro.The president’s swearing-in for another six-year term is scheduled for Jan. 10, but his announcement, following weeks in which he remained out of public view, raised questions about whether the inauguration will take place.“This is how life goes,” Chavez said in his televised address, which prompted his followers to gather in churches and public squares to pray and chant slogans supporting him. “God willing, I hope to be able to give you good news in the coming days.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
       "2699  CARTAGENA, Colombia — President Obama concluded a contentious hemispheric summit on the defensive Sunday as it ended without agreement on whether Cuba’s Communist leaders should be invited to the next meeting, something the United States firmly opposes.The standoff meant that the sixth Summit of the Americas ended without an official declaration — a negotiated statement of shared principles from the hemisphere’s heads of state — and left open the question of whether there would be a seventh such meeting.The ambiguous conclusion underscored the fact that Obama, while pledging a new relationship with the United States’ leery southern neighbors, has had little success in bridging significant policy differences that have divided the region for decades.With the scandal involving a number of Secret Service agents and prostitution coloring the weekend meeting, Obama departed here with the U.S. image mildly blemished and the enduring political differences between the hemisphere’s wealthy north and rising south firmly intact.“I’m not somebody who brings to the table here a lot of baggage from the past, and I want to look at these issues in a new and fresh way,” Obama said during a Sunday news conference with Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos. “I am sometimes puzzled by the degree to which countries that themselves have undergone enormous transformations, that have known the oppression of dictatorships or have found themselves on the wrong side of the ruling elite, and have suffered for it, why we would ignore that same principle here.”Cuba and the decades-old U.S. embargo against it, which Latin American and Caribbean leaders derisively call a “blockade,” has been a traditional bone of contention between the United States and much of the rest of the region.But it emerged here as only one of several issues, including U.S. anti-drug and monetary policy, that together illustrated how far the United States remains outside the hemisphere’s political consensus.The summit was more buttoned up than the previous one three years ago, largely because several of the region’s most anti-American leaders did not attend. The cultural programming around the meetings showcased this lovely seaside city and the progress made by Colombia, where an array of drug-funded armed groups has faded in recent years.Santos attributed Colombia’s success in part to the billions of dollars in U.S. aid over the past decade. But the open criticism directed toward the U.S. approach to several issues also underscored the new confidence felt by Latin American leaders as they guide a region that is improving economically while the United States struggles to find its financial footing.Although Obama has presented the United States as a more equal partner in hemispheric affairs and has spoken forcefully on issues such as inequality that have defined Latin American politics for years, some of his policies fall outside the region’s mainstream. He defended them staunchly, nonetheless.Many leaders here pushed for a new strategy to combat the illicit drug trade, fueled by U.S. demand. Some proposed legalization — for possession and by regulating the trade — but Obama made clear here that he does not believe it would prove more effective than the law enforcement approach funded by the United States.“I think it is wholly appropriate for us to discuss this issue,” Obama said, adding that while Colombia is emerging from a “wrenching period,” several “smaller countries” in Central America are “starting to feel overwhelmed” by drug violence. “It wouldn’t make sense for us not to examine what works and what doesn’t.”New leaders emergingAs the Castro brothers in Cuba grow old, Venezuela’s Hugo Chavez battles cancer and other important regional leaders leave office, Latin America is determining which new leaders will emerge.A tacit competition has shaped up between Brazil and Colombia, both growing economically and benefiting from a skilled business class. The summit showcased their leaders, who were sometimes at odds with Obama.Santos and Brazil’s Dilma Rousseff, who visited the White House last week, publicly criticized U.S. monetary policy for devaluing the currencies of developing countries.And Santos worried aloud whether America is “exporting unemployment” to Latin American countries that have weathered the global economic downturn better than the United States.“We all have the feeling of the enormous opportunities we have to work together,” Santos said at his news conference with Obama, putting the best light on their differences.There were moments of agreement, too. Obama announced here Sunday that Colombia has complied with a key condition of the free-trade agreement passed last year that is designed to better protect labor activists from political violence.The labor certification allows the deal to take effect May 15. U.S. exports to Colombia last year totaled $14.8 billion, and the agreement will eliminate tariffs on 80 percent of U.S. consumer and industrial goods bound for the country and phase the rest out over the next decade.But the election-year decision has angered U.S. labor leaders, who say Colombia has not made enough progress in protecting union activists in Colombia and in punishing those who commit crimes against them.In a letter to Obama last week, AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka wrote that “less than 10 percent of the nearly 3,000 cases of trade unionists murders since 1986 have reached a conviction,” and that “none of the 29 labor activists killed in 2011 had their cases resolved by a successful prosecution.” The labor group endorsed Obama for president last month.“We all know that more work needs to be done, but we have made significant progress,” Obama said of Colombia’s labor rights record.Cuba issue still resonatesCuba, a historic wedge issue between the United States and its closest political allies in the region, overwhelmed the summit’s final day.Under U.S. pressure, Cuba’s Raul Castro was not invited to this meeting, and many influential regional leaders, led by Rousseff and Santos, indicated that they would not attend another without Cuba.Ecuador’s president, Rafael Correa, declined to attend the summit in protest, and other leading leftists close to Cuba, including Nicaragua’s Daniel Ortega, did not show up.Chavez, who usually thrives on the attention of regional forums, was also not present, because of illness.But the issue still resonates throughout Latin America, evoking the Cold War-era political divide between left and right that Obama on Sunday said had ended.“The fact of the matter is that Cuba, unlike the other countries participating, has not moved to democracy, is not respecting human rights,” Obama said. “I’m hoping the transition takes place.”More on this story:Campaign themes resonate at summitObama promotes initiative to connect small businesses in the AmericasColombia presents its new faceHilary Clinton in Colombia dances, drinks beer                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
       "2707  Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad left Tehran today to attend Hugo Chavez's funeral. But that's not all -- in his condolences for the former Venezuelan president, Ahmadinejad said he has “no doubt Chavez will return to Earth together with Jesus and the perfect” Imam Mahdi, the most revered figure of Shiite Muslims, according to AP.Ahmadinejad also said the three men will together “establish peace, justice and kindness” in the world, and that he is “suspicious” about the cause of Chavez’s cancer.Intriguingly, Ahmadinejad -- who had close ties with Chavez, and who has coined some colorful quotes before -- is not the only one speaking of Chavez in almost messianic terms.

       "2860  CNN Chile reported the death of long-ailing Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez last night, news that the country has braced for since he disappeared from the public eye in December. But even as social media erupted with the news, other sources -- including CNN’s corporate parent -- said the report couldn’t be verified. Multiple sources now say that it’s false. These mistakes happen, of course, especially in a news cycle that moves at the speed of tweets. But the mix-up seems especially telling in Venezuela, where very few know Chavez’s health status.The president left the public eye in December, when he went to Cuba for medical treatment. The Post’s Juan Forrero reports from Caracas that while officials have claimed Chavez is closely involved in the government’s day-to-day operations, opposition leaders have grown increasingly suspicious.Venezuelans still don’t know what kind of cancer Chavez has or what his prognosis is. And Chavez was too ill to attend his own inauguration on Jan. 10, leaving a leadership vacuum in his wake. In fact, the president’s most public appearances these days are on Twitter, where he sends messages like this one: “We have returned again to the Venezuelan homeland. Thank God!! Thank you beloved homeland!! Here we continue treatment.” The CNN Chile report relied on the word of Guillermo Cochez, Panama’s ex-ambassador to the regional Organization of American States. According to Cochez, Chavez had been brain-dead and on life support since Dec. 31, and died on Feb. 23 after his daughters asked to remove his breathing tube.“I challenge the Venezuelan government to refute me,” Cochez told CNN Chile, asking them to present Chavez publicly if he is, in fact, still alive.But there are plenty of reasons to doubt Cochez, as Gideon Lichfield has pointed out at Quartz. For one thing, Cochez has made these kinds of claims before. And a photo of Chavez and his daughters released in mid-February doesn’t appear to show a man on life support.This morning, NBC Latino quoted sources in Venezuela saying Chavez is alive and hospitalized in Caracas, with “no change” in his condition. Vice President Nicolas Maduro told the Telegraph that he recently had a five-hour meeting with Chavez, and that the president’s poor health has not stopped him from “giving orders on all aspects of the economic, social and political life of our country.”Cochez had one thing right: Until Chavez makes a public appearance, it's very difficult to know for sure.

       "2907  CARACAS, Venezuela — Venezuela’s government on Monday defended a presidential election that authorities said gave interim leader Nicolas Maduro a six-year term, backtracking on a pledge he had made to permit an audit of ballots demanded by the opposition after the razor-thin victory.Henrique Capriles, who had challenged Maduro in the Sunday election, which was held six weeks after President Hugo Chavez’s death, insisted that he had won the vote and called for a hand count of all the paper ballots.Maduro, though, was proclaimed the winner Monday by the National Electoral Council, which certified the victory in a ceremony broadcast on national television, paving the way for his inauguration Friday.“There is no doubt here about who won the election,” Elias Jaua, the foreign minister and a former vice president, said in a speech in which he defended the election result and characterized the country’s electoral system as the best in the world. “Venezuelans, let’s feel proud of yesterday’s vote.”Soon after Maduro’s victory was announced Sunday night, Vicente Diaz, one of the rectors of the electoral council, called for an audit of the vote.Minutes later, Maduro announced to a crowd of supporters outside the presidential palace, “We’re going to do it.”“We’re not afraid. Let the boxes talk — that the truth be told,” said Maduro, 50, referring to the cardboard boxes that hold ballots.But by Monday morning, the potent state media apparatus played one interview after another of observers and politicians praising Venezuela’s automated voting system.And the electoral council — which is made up of five members, four of them allies of the government — made clear that it would not support a recount.“The Venezuelan electoral system worked perfectly,” said Tibisay Lucena, president of the council. “Venezuela is the country in the Americas with the most lively and vibrant democracy.”On Monday, though, Capriles declined to concede and cited 3,200 instances of irregularities in the voting process, as well as the use of Venezuela’s well-worn electoral machine to get the vote out for Maduro.Capriles, 40, said his campaign had asked electoral authorities not to proclaim Maduro the winner pending a hand count of the ballots. He said the opposition’s estimates of the vote showed that he had secured a narrow victory over Maduro.“Here the fight is not against the people,” said Capriles, a governor and lawyer. “It’s a fight of the people against an illegitimate government.”He called on Venezuelans nationwide to bang pots and pans in protest — and they did. Some students in Caracas also clashed with National Guard troops, who fired tear gas and rubber bullets.Francisco Lopez, 29, was among those who congregated in Altamira Plaza in the heart of opposition country. “I don’t know what’s going to happen,” he said, “but we’re going to defend the vote.”Observers, though, said the opposition’s push had little chance of being heard in a country where the president controls all institutions.“The abuses of this government, the advantages they have, I’ve never seen it anywhere,” said Ignacio Arcaya, a former diplomat in Chavez’s government who is now in the opposition. “In a country with no judicial independence, how could you expect that there will be any change?”And Maduro’s response in a televised news conference was to call opposition leaders part of a cabal designed to replace his government with one that would permit the United States to plunder the country.“Their plan is not a democratic plan but a coup-plotting plan,” Maduro said.The dispute over the election result came a day after he was expected to garner a resounding victory.The former union activist turned vice president had the sympathy vote after Chavez died following a long battle with cancer, and some pollsters put Maduro’s pre-vote lead in double digits.But the margin of victory was less than two percentage points, just six months after Chavez beat Capriles by 11 percentage points to win a third six-year term as president. Maduro won, the electoral council said, by more than 260,000 votesIn Washington, White House spokesman Jay Carney called Capriles’s request for an audit of votes an “important, prudent and necessary step” to ensure that Venezuelans have trust in the election result. The Washington-based Organization of American States offered to help Venezuela with a possible audit.The Venezuelan government rejected such calls as meddling in internal affairs, with officials here instead touting congratulatory messages sent by allies, including Russia, Argentina and Cuba.Still, the narrow margin of victory was a letdown for many in the government, whose leadership had been predicting a landslide, arguing that a vast majority of Venezuelans supported Chavez’s radical transformation of the country into a socialist state. It means that Maduro will begin his term without the mandate that his boss enjoyed.“Teflon was limited to Chavez,” said Michael Shifter, president of the Washington-based Inter-American Dialogue, a policy group. “The sympathy for Chavez proved more fleeting than expected. In the end, absent charisma, issues mattered. So do campaigns. Capriles proved adept in taking advantage of a weak opponent and a nation that Chavez left in sorry shape.”Indeed, even in the high echelons of the Chavista ranks, at least one powerful official appeared troubled by the slim margin of victory. Diosdado Cabello, a former military man with close ties to rich executives who have lucrative state contracts, said, “The results oblige us to make a profound self-criticism.”The comment was significant because analysts and politicians here view Cabello as Maduro’s rival. And his ties to powerful generals in the military are at sharp odds with the alliances that Maduro has with social groups and with the Cuban government.Maduro “has the type of background that the military doesn’t always appreciate,” said Javier Corrales, an Amherst College expert on Venezuela. “Some people say that the military never loved the ties to Cuba, and Maduro is very open about his ties to Cuba.”Corrales said Maduro does not appear to have the kind of ability that Chavez had to hold together the disparate coalition that makes up Chavismo, from the military to radical Marxists, from business executives to armed groups in the slums and the masses of poor.“The Chavistas, especially in the leadership, are going to say, ‘You’re having trouble maintaining the coalition,’ ” Corrales said. “Chavez, to his credit, was able to put together the most successful coalition between radical leftists and the military.”Scott Wilson in Washington contributed to this report.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",
       "2912  CARACAS, Venezuela — With cancer-stricken President Hugo Chavez battling for his life, the Obama administration has embarked on a discreet but concerted weeks-long diplomatic initiative to open channels of communication with his sharply anti-American government.The effort to break through a years-old deep freeze with one of the world’s top oil suppliers comes as Venezuela plunged deeper into an institutional crisis Wednesday over Chavez’s long absence since undergoing surgery Dec. 11 in Cuba.But American officials have been preparing for a post-Chavez scenario, one in which they can engage Caracas on a variety of concerns the State Department has had about the Venezuelan government’s policies. They include the close alliance Venezuela has built with Iran, extensive narco-trafficking through Venezuelan territory and prickly economic issues important to U.S. companies, such as their inability to repatriate earnings from here because of currency controls.“Regardless of what happens politically in Venezuela, if the Venezuelan government and if the Venezuelan people want to move forward with us, we think there is a path that’s possible,” State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said Wednesday. “It is just going to take two to tango.”Nuland spoke with reporters soon after Venezuela plunged deeper into an institutional crisis over Chavez’s absence. The 58-year-old leftist firebrand, who has not been seen publicly in a month, has been so hobbled by his illness that the government announced he would not attend his inauguration Thursday for a fourth term.Opponents say that his latest six-year term ends Thursday and that if he does not appear for his swearing-in, the head of the National Assembly must assume leadership on an interim basis.But Wednesday, the Supreme Court in Venezuela ruled that the inauguration could be postponed and that Chavez actively remains head of state, even though his health status is a mystery.“We have determined that there is not even a temporary absence,” the court’s president, Luisa Estella Morales, told reporters. She said the court also did not see any “merits” in appointing a medical board to determine the state of Chavez’s health, as his opponents have demanded in recent days.Exploratory talksIn the event that he dies or becomes too incapacitated to recover, Chavez has said that Vice President Nicolas Maduro, a confidant of the president and a former union leader, should be the successor.Maduro is considered an ideologue close to Cuba’s Communist leadership and in lock step with Chavez’s long-standing policy of distancing Venezuela from the United States, which had been a close ally until his presidency began in 1999. As foreign minister, a position he still holds, Maduro has led Chavez’s campaign to forge closer ties with U.S. adversaries such as Iran.But Maduro is also seen as a negotiator, and the Americans have begun their exploratory talks in part by seeking him out, said a senior U.S. official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the delicate nature of the talks with Venezuela.In November, Roberta S. Jacobson, the assistant secretary of state for Western Hemisphere affairs, spoke by phone with Maduro, the senior official said. There also have been meetings in Washington between Kevin Whitaker, a deputy assistant secretary of state, and Roy Chaderton, the Venezuelan ambassador to the Organization of American States, which is based in the city.“I would characterize it as a handful of conversations that have taken place,” the U.S. official said. The Obama administration, the official added, has in recent weeks “had more echo and better luck” engaging Venezuela than in the past seven years, when the relationship started to splinter badly.The official, as well as people who have worked with Maduro in Caracas on foreign-policy issues, cautioned that the talks are designed to simply find a channel of communication.“We want to start small and go from that, diplomacy 101,” the official said. The idea is to then go on to broader talks on issues important to the United States, including oil, drug trafficking and terrorism, and, principally, Venezuela’s ties with the Iranian government — which Washington is working to isolate.At this stage, with Venezuela convulsed by a constitutional crisis, the talks are delicate.Last week, Maduro publicly stressed that the contacts with the Americans were not designed to jump-start relations should Chavez die. Maduro said the president had, in fact, authorized the conversations.“We stressed the need for respect for the revolutionary and democratic process in Venezuela,” he told state television.The U.S. official said the talks began because diplomats and the White House thought the moment was apt, with President Obama and Chavez having been reelected in the fall. “We were looking at four years, at least, going forward,” the official said.But moving forward will not be easy.“I don’t think there are great illusions about having some partnerships or of any quick and dramatic change in the relationship,” said Michael Shifter, a policy analyst in Washington.Hostility toward WashingtonA central ideological pillar of Chavez’s rule over 14 years has been to oppose Republican and Democratic administrations in Washington, which he accuses of trying to destabilize his government.“I think they really believe it, that we are out there at some level to do them ill,” said Charles Shapiro, president of the Institute of the Americas, a think tank in San Diego.As ambassador to Venezuela from 2002 to 2004, Shapiro met with Chavez and other high- ranking officials, including Maduro. But the relationship began to fall apart, with Chavez accusing the United States of supporting a coup that briefly ousted him from power. U.S. officials have long denied the charge.Shapiro recalled how Maduro made what he called unsubstantiated accusations about CIA activity in Venezuela, without ever approaching the embassy with a complaint. He said that as time went by, the United States became a useful foil for Chavez and most Venezuelan officials withdrew contact.“A sure way to ruin your career, to become a backbencher, was to become too friendly with the U.S. Embassy,” Shapiro said.On a practical level, the Venezuelan government stopped cooperating with Washington’s counter-drug operations and for years was accused of assisting guerrillas in neighboring Colombia, the closest U.S. ally in the region. Under Maduro’s watch as foreign minister, Venezuela became friendlier with pariah states such as Syria, Libya and Belarus.Roger Noriega, who oversaw the George W. Bush administration’s policies in Latin America from 2003 to 2005, said the U.S. diplomatic initiatives could legitimize Maduro.Noriega said that if Chavez dies, there would be a power struggle between Maduro and the head of the National Assembly, Diosdado Cabello, who is allied with the military and is a power broker among the nouveau riche who benefited from the government’s free-spending ways. Noriega said the United States should wait until the dust settles.“This is an heir to a guy who’s been unrelentingly hostile to the United States and really doing his bidding,” Noriega said of Maduro. “Did they see that this is a very convoluted, complicated succession, a power struggle within Chavismo, and they’re meeting with one of the protagonists in this power struggle?”But two former Chavez loyalists who now oppose the government — former congressman Jose Albornoz and Vladimir Villegas, a former deputy foreign minister — said Maduro’s experience as a diplomat and union negotiator would make him a more promising negotiator for the Americans than Cabello.Albornoz said that although Maduro has a radical edge, he is pragmatic and has a “geopolitical vision.” The former congressman also said that Venezuela’s dire problems require cooperation with the United States and an imaginative approach by diplomats.“The relations with the United States have to be redefined,”    \n",
       "3030  CARACAS, VENEZUELA — All week long, from the moments before President Hugo Chavez died and in the days that followed, the man Chavez picked to succeed him has thundered from the podium against oligarchs, transnational oil companies and the United States.Nicolas Maduro, who was sworn in as president Friday after Chavez lost a battle with cancer, is poised to govern this oil-rich country until at least 2019 and carry on with the same policies as his boss.On Saturday, the country’s electoral board said a presidential election, as mandated by the constitution after the death of a president, would take place April 14.Minutes later, Venezuela’s coalition of opposition groups said it had decided to offer its candidacy to Henrique Capriles, a lawyer and governor of Miranda state who challenged Chavez in the presidential election in October.Pollsters and political analysts say that Capriles’s charisma and seasoning as a campaigner could be too little to defeat Chavez’s chosen successor so soon after his death, which has left the country in an unprecedented state of loss. As Chavez’s loyal aide for a generation, the 50-year-old Maduro not only has the country’s sympathy vote but now controls the purse strings that have given the government a major boost in one election after another.With the outcome of an election nearly foretold, many Venezuelans are asking themselves what kind of president Maduro might be — a conciliator open to healing wounds or a demagogue who uses his position to control all the levers of powers, as critics say Chavez did.Once seen as reserved, Maduro has come out in recent speeches with not only the same bellicose rhetoric as Chavez but also a similar fire-and-brimstone cadence. He has pledged to keep alive El Comandante’s flame by saving the poor from greedy elites operating here and in the United States, which he calls Venezuela’s “historic enemy.”“Sooner rather than later the imperialist elites who govern the United States will have to learn to live with absolute respect with the insurrectional peoples of America,” he said moments after receiving the presidential sash in Friday’s inauguration. “We’ve decided to be free, and nothing and no one will take that independence that was re-conquered with our commander Hugo Chavez at the helm.”As Maduro became more visible in recent weeks, people here wondered if the beefy former bus driver would as president turn out to be the calm apparatchik some diplomats found him to be. That Maduro was said to be pragmatic, a negotiator with the patience to sit down with adversaries, a leader open to resolving the polarization Chavez helped create in 14 years in power.But the picture that is emerging of Maduro — particularly in the past four days of mourning for Chavez, who died Tuesday afternoon — is of a leader who appears to be ready to accelerate the former president’s agenda. That is shaping up to mean insults and threats such as the ones Maduro has issued this past week. And for Venezuela’s beleaguered opposition and the press, it may mean renewed efforts to corral them.“I thought he represents the most orthodox of socialist thought, of the doctrinaire socialist thought that Chavez defended,” said Demetrio Boersner, a historian and columnist. “He’s doing all he can to apparently speak like Chavez and follow Chavez’s style in all its details so that the popular masses see him as a kind of son of Chavez, that he’s saying what the fallen caudillo [strongman] would say.”Maduro, to be sure, was the man chosen by Chavez as his successor, a decision Chavez made public on Dec. 8, when he went on national television to instruct Venezuelans to vote for Maduro should he be forced from the presidency. Chavez never gave another speech.Even before Chavez died, Maduro had begun to fire off incendiary accusations against Venezuelan leaders, the press and the United States. Just before Chavez’s death, he went on national television and implied that the United States was behind Chavez’s cancer, having “infected” him.To a State Department official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the delicate nature of relations with Venezuela, Maduro’s speech was consistent with how Chavez managed relations with Washington. “And in that respect,” the official said, “it wasn’t very encouraging.”It also wasn’t very encouraging to Venezuelans in the opposition or the large segment of the population that pollsters say are tired of the political sectarianism in Venezuela.Maduro has railed against the “rancid oligarchy,” accused Capriles of plotting against the government and warned of hazy destabilization efforts. He also has stressed repeatedly that he is an accidental president with no designs on power and that, as such, will closely follow Chavez’s guiding principles.“I swear, in the name of the most absolute loyalty to commander Hugo Chavez, that we will obey the constitution, with a firm hand of a people who are free. I swear!” he said at the inauguration Friday.Javier Corrales, a Venezuela expert at Amherst College, said that like Chavez, Maduro is finding that blaming others can pay off politically, particularly as serious economic problems mount.“He has discovered, as Chavez did, that seeking to be in the extreme of the ideological spectrum is his safest spot to avoid attacks from the left, provoke the opposition and transform the political arena into a shouting match,” Corrales said.Many observers — among them government opponents and those in Chavez’s movement — say that Maduro appears to be trying hard to appeal to the masses who liked the former president’s rhetoric while ensuring that “Chavismo” holds together.But there are pitfalls, namely that he may not sound authentic to some, particularly if problems such as rampant crime, inflation, food shortages and a dysfunctional economy grow worse.“He’s trying hard to copy him,” said Carlos Berrizbeitia, an opposition lawmaker. “But he doesn’t have the same tone, because he doesn’t have the same discourse and charisma that Chavez did.”This week, many rank-and-file Chavistas — dressed in red, their eyes red from crying — spoke on the street of how they would continue to follow the directions of their dead leader. And all of them remember how Chavez had told them in his last public comments to support Maduro.“Of course I’ll do as El Comandante told us to do,” said Maria Andrade, 54. “So if the elections were tomorrow, well, I’m sure that all the Venezuelans would be in the street going to vote for Maduro.”Emilia Diaz contributed to this report.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",
       "3311  On May 8, 1967, two small boats carrying a dozen heavily armed fighters made landfall near Machurucuto, a tiny fishing village 100 miles east of the Venezuelan capital, Caracas. Their plan was to march inland and recruit Venezuelan peasants to the cause of socialist revolution.The eight Venezuelans and four Cubans who took part in this mad adventure were on a mission from Fidel Castro. It was the heyday of Cuban agitation abroad, with Cuban-backed guerrilla cells spreading throughout Latin America.The fighters sent to Machurucuto had bad luck, though. A local fisherman spotted their abandoned boats and notified the Venezuelan military. An all-night gun battle followed. Little more than 72 hours after landing, nine of the guerrillas were dead and two others captured. Just one got away.The first and only foreign military invasion of Venezuela of the past hundred years was a three-day-long fiasco.The Machurucuto Incident, as this tiny drama came to be known, was the opening salvo in Castro’s decades-long obsession with bringing socialist revolution to Venezuela. With a shared Caribbean culture and vast oil wealth, Venezuela was a tempting target for Fidel from the start.His big break came nearly three decades later, in December 1994, when a Venezuelan lieutenant colonel fresh out of a two-year stint in jail for leading an ill-starred coup attempt landed in Havana for a hero’s welcome.As a clandestine conspirator, like his entire generation of Latin American wannabe revolutionaries, Hugo Chávez had idolized Fidel Castro. Castro sat enraptured as the dissident gave a keynote address to the University of Havana live on state television, raising the young Chávez’s stature immeasurably. The two struck up a famously intimate friendship.In 1998, against all the odds, Castro’s protege was elected to Venezuela’s presidency, and the dream of Machurucuto came roaring back to life. Together, the two men forged an unprecedentedly close relationship. Billions of Venezuelan oil dollars flowed into Castro’s coffers as tens of thousands of Cuban “technical advisers” — doctors, sports trainers and an unknowable number of spies — spread throughout Venezuela. Cuba’s flag flew side by side with our own at Venezuelan military bases. Chávez’s personal security detail was handed over to Cuban intelligence.Finally, in 2007, Chávez declared that Cuba and Venezuela were a single nation. “Deep down,” he said, “we are one single government.”It was simply unprecedented: the virtual invasion of a larger, more powerful country by a smaller, weaker one at the larger country’s behest. Cuban methods for stamping out the free press and snuffing out dissent very gradually began to spread throughout Venezuela.Cuban infiltration of Venezuelan state institutions — both military and civilian — was complete, with Cuban “advisers” watching over virtually every single office, institute, ministry, barrack and embassy of the Venezuelan state. Reporting directly back to Havana, this web of spies led to a bizarre situation where Castro often had a clearer intelligence picture of what was happening inside the Venezuelan state than the Venezuelan state itself. Chávez, by all accounts, simply trusted Castro’s spies more than he did his own.In 2011, the Machurucuto incident cycle was completed when Fernando Soto Rojas, one of just three guerrillas who lived to tell the tale of the 1967 invasion, was elected speaker of Venezuela’s National Assembly. An aging communist without much of a political machine of his own, he had ridden his Cuban revolutionary street cred to the pinnacle of the Venezuelan state.Later that year, when Chávez fell ill with cancer, the full extent of his devotion to Castro was revealed as a matter of life and death. Though the world’s premier cancer specialists in Brazil, France and the United States lined up to offer him cutting-edge treatment, Chávez refused to be seen by anyone other than the Cubans. Absent for long spells in a Havana hospital, Chávez’s health became a state secret — and a Cuban state secret, at that. Castro had detailed knowledge of Chávez’s condition when nobody in Caracas did.If there’s one maxim Castro was devoted to throughout his life, it’s the idea that knowledge is power. Knowing Chávez’s cancer was terminal months before anyone else did allowed the Cubans the decisive edge in the high-stakes jockeying to select his successor.There was no secret whom Castro favored: Nicolás Maduro may have been a gray, uncharismatic politician, but he was a Fidelista through and through. A former radical bus union organizer, Maduro had come up through the ranks of Liga Socialista, a militantly pro-Cuban fringe party he joined as a teenager. The closest thing to a university education he had came in 1986and 1987 when, as a 24-year-old, he undertook two years of intense ideological training at Cuba’s school of political training, along with communist activists from seven other Latin American countries.For years as Chávez’s foreign minister, he had never shown the slightest deviation from Havana’s line. Maduro was the man Castro could trust to secure Cuba’s interests in Venezuela after Chávez’s death. And succeed Chávez he did.In the long history of Castro’s sprawling record of international adventurism — from Nicaragua and Bolivia to Congo, Angola, Israel and beyond — Venezuela is but one chapter.Success came late, but when it did it was complete. On the day he died, Castro left Venezuela the way he had dreamed since his youth: radically unfree and shackled to a Marxist dictator wholly subservient to Cuban interests.Dictatorship in Venezuela is Castro’s greatest foreign policy victory, the cornerstone of his hemispheric legacy.

       "3664  HAVANA — The protests that erupted Friday in Havana at airline offices and outside Ecuador's Embassy were a rare occurrence in this tightly controlled society, where street demonstrations and anti-government activism are essentially forbidden.As such, the protests were an opportunity to see the Cuban government's extensive security apparatus in action. In a part of the world where police often respond to demonstrators with riot shields, tear gas and clubs, the Cuban government showed how it can squelch any disturbance with subtle psychological messaging and a chess-game approach to controlling the streets.The protests flared up after the Ecuadoran government announced a new visa requirement, effective Dec. 1, in an attempt to stop Cubans from using their country as a springboard to the United States. For those who had laid down their life savings for an airline ticket, the rules had suddenly changed, potentially leaving them unable to travel or get a refund. They were incensed.It didn't really matter to Cuban authorities that the immediate target of the protesters' ire was Ecuador, not the communist government. Cuban officials have long insisted they cannot afford any unrest that potentially gets out of hand, lest the Americans use it as an excuse to intervene. The government keeps a tight lid on any anti-Castro activity, and dissident groups like the Ladies in White who attempt weekly protest marches are hauled off and handled roughly.But Friday's event was different because it wasn't planned. And it was loaded with risk, since it was driven by Cubans determined to leave, just like the 1980 occupation of the Peruvian Embassy that led to the Mariel boatlift.By late morning Friday, when it became clear that airlines were not offering refunds, an angry crowd of several hundred gathered outside the Ecuadoran Embassy in the city's Miramar neighborhood, demanding visas and chanting, \"Give us our money back!\"Uniformed Cuban police officers flooded the area, but more impressive was the deployment of plainclothes security agents. They seemed to appear out of nowhere, some dressed in sneakers, ripped jeans and gold jewelry, making them nearly indistinguishable from the protesters. Others appeared to be moving casually among the crowd.Only the uniformed police were armed, and they had no helmets, clubs or other riot gear, let alone armored vehicles. Instead of projecting force with a show of weapons or equipment, the Cuban agents with their sheer numbers gave the impression that they were everywhere, and the situation was never out of their control.Calmly, methodically, Cuban police and security agents began carving up the neighborhood around the Ecuadoran Embassy like a chessboard, closing streets and isolating the cluster of protesters from onlookers or anyone who might consider joining them.Now the protesters were hemmed in. They were free to leave, but not to return. After that it was mostly just a game of attrition.Government trucks arrived with metal barricades to fully seal off the area. More plainclothes officers and security agents poured in, then soldiers and special forces troops, nearly all of them unarmed.By late afternoon, it began to rain, and many of the protesters gave up at that point, knowing the embassy would be closed over the weekend. A smaller number refused to leave.\"We had to go to the bathroom right in the street, in front of the police,\" said Yalena de la Oz, 30, who said she spent Friday night in the street with other protesters who insisted they wouldn't go until they had visas. She has a flight to Quito on Dec. 2.The government kept its barricades and police lines in place through the weekend, knowing it would need them Monday.By Monday before dawn, de la Oz was back along with several hundred others demanding a response from Ecuadoran officials. By then, the barricades were so extensive that the protesters had to stand two blocks from the embassy. There were easily as many police and soldiers as demonstrators. Entire families sat on the sidewalks with their packed suitcases.The crowd finally dispersed Monday afternoon when Ecuadoran Embassy officials said they would begin issuing visas to Cubans who had already purchased flights. Cheers went up as some in the crowd went running to make photocopies of their passports and plane tickets.Cuban migration to the United States has surged to its highest levels in decades this year, partly on fears that better ties with the United States will mean an end to the unique immigration benefits they received under the Cuban Adjustment Act of 1966.U.S. and Cuban officials met in Washington on Monday for regularly scheduled talks on migration issues but remained at an impasse, as the U.S. side said the Adjustment Act isn't up for discussion. The presence of some 3,000 U.S.-bound Cuban migrants stranded in Costa Rica has put new focus on the issue; the migrants were stopped when Nicaragua recently closed its southern border to them.On Tuesday morning, a few hours after the meeting in Washington, Cuban authorities said they will reinstate the exit visa system for many categories of doctors, saying the measure was needed to stop a brain drain that is undermining the island's public health system. Cuban physicians will have to apply for permission to travel abroad starting Dec. 7, just as they did before 2013, when the government lifted its widely despised exit visa requirement.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",
       "3811  CNN Chile reported the death of long-ailing Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez last night, news that the country has braced for since he disappeared from the public eye in December. But even as social media erupted with the news, other sources -- including CNN’s corporate parent -- said the report couldn’t be verified. Multiple sources now say that it’s false. These mistakes happen, of course, especially in a news cycle that moves at the speed of tweets. But the mix-up seems especially telling in Venezuela, where very few know Chavez’s health status.The president left the public eye in December, when he went to Cuba for medical treatment. The Post’s Juan Forrero reports from Caracas that while officials have claimed Chavez is closely involved in the government’s day-to-day operations, opposition leaders have grown increasingly suspicious.Venezuelans still don’t know what kind of cancer Chavez has or what his prognosis is. And Chavez was too ill to attend his own inauguration on Jan. 10, leaving a leadership vacuum in his wake. In fact, the president’s most public appearances these days are on Twitter, where he sends messages like this one: “We have returned again to the Venezuelan homeland. Thank God!! Thank you beloved homeland!! Here we continue treatment.” The CNN Chile report relied on the word of Guillermo Cochez, Panama’s ex-ambassador to the regional Organization of American States. According to Cochez, Chavez had been brain-dead and on life support since Dec. 31, and died on Feb. 23 after his daughters asked to remove his breathing tube.“I challenge the Venezuelan government to refute me,” Cochez told CNN Chile, asking them to present Chavez publicly if he is, in fact, still alive.But there are plenty of reasons to doubt Cochez, as Gideon Lichfield has pointed out at Quartz. For one thing, Cochez has made these kinds of claims before. And a photo of Chavez and his daughters released in mid-February doesn’t appear to show a man on life support.This morning, NBC Latino quoted sources in Venezuela saying Chavez is alive and hospitalized in Caracas, with “no change” in his condition. Vice President Nicolas Maduro told the Telegraph that he recently had a five-hour meeting with Chavez, and that the president’s poor health has not stopped him from “giving orders on all aspects of the economic, social and political life of our country.”Cochez had one thing right: Until Chavez makes a public appearance, it's very difficult to know for sure.

       "3904  Pope Benedict XVI shocked the world Monday morning by announcing that he will step down on Feb. 28, saying he could no longer serve \"due to an advanced age.\" He is the first pontiff to resign since 1415.[liveblog]#liveevent-toolbar { display: none; } When the pope was powerful For centuries, the pope was one of most powerful people in the world. He jockeyed with the kings and monarchs of Europe, who needed his approval – and his church – to rule their own countries. Pope Benedict XVI lives in a very different time, one in which his office has purview over internal Catholic theology and not much else. But how did the pontiff's power subside over the centuries? And could the modern pope carve out a role that encompasses more than the guiding of the Catholic faithful? Read the full story, tracing the rise and fall of the pope's once-great power, here. 5:32 pm Max Fisher 5:20 pm Caitlin Dewey Benedict’s meager political legacy Pope John Paul II with Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger of Munich (later Pope Benedict XVI) in 1979. (AP Photo/File) “I was the first Western journalist inside the KGB headquarters in 1990,” Eric Margolis told PBS, recounting his venture into the heart of the Soviet Union’s once-fearsome intelligence service, which had just collapsed along with the empire that it served. “The generals told me that the Vatican and the Pope, above all, was regarded as their number one, most dangerous enemy in the world,” he said. Mikhail Gorbachev, the final Soviet leader, once said of the Cold War’s peaceful end, “It would have been impossible without the pope.” That pope was John Paul II, Benedict XVI's predecessor, whose reign from 1978 to 2005 saw him assert a remarkably prominent role in global politics. Benedict never quite met John Paul's benchmark, traveling less and playing a smaller role both within and outside of the Catholic world.

Anthony Stevens-Arroyo asked the question on The Post's OnFaith site: Will all popes after Benedict XVI abdicate? It is a most modern idea to view the pope as CEO of a global corporation, rather than as a living saint chosen by God. This perspective defines church authority according to the modernizing influences of the II Vatican Council (1962-1964) and breaks with the feudal traditions of medieval Christendom, when popes - like emperors - ruled until they died. I predict that Pope Benedict XVI’s legacy will be remembered more as a progressive step towards modernity rather than a pontificate with very conservative pronouncements. A scholar and promoter of change at the II Vatican Council where as a young cleric he was afforded the status of peritus or “expert,” Joseph Ratzinger was sometimes liberal and sometimes conservative but always thoughtful. Unlike a purely pragmatic administrator, his papacy demonstrated an academician’s sensitivity to human history and theological nuance. Consider how his encyclical Caritas In Veritate was chock-full of nuance for both sides of every issue. Predictably, some decided to attribute to Pope Benedict only the parts that were conservative (gold), and reject what was liberal (red), and the Web site of the Catholic League lists, much like a cafeteria menu, mostly his conservative stances omitting papal statements for redistribution of wealth and concern for the environment. Thus, as a very complex thinker, Benedict knows that the future church requires more intellectual and physical vigor than he could have mustered. Moreover, the deterioration in the health of his predecessor, Blessed John Paul II, during the pedophilia crisis probably influenced his thinking about papal abdication.

Roughly three-quarters of Catholics (74 percent) said they were satisfied with “the leadership provided by the Pope” according to a 2012 Pew Research Center survey, with 34 percent “very satisfied.” Overall, about one in five were dissatisfied (21 percent). High-level satisfaction with the Pope (34 percent) was a bit lower than for local parish priests (49 percent) and Catholic nuns in the United States (50 percent). Still, the Pope was more popular than American bishops generally (24 percent very satisfied). Catholics offered a more muted personal reaction to Pope Benedict in a May 2010 CBS News/New York Times poll, a survey that detected dissatisfaction with the church’s handling of child sexual abuse scandals. Some 58 percent of Catholics said the Vatican has done a poor job handling reports of past sexual abuse of children by priests, while 31 percent thought they did a good job. In that poll, 43 percent of Catholics had a favorable view of Pope Benedict, 17 percent unfavorable and 38 percent unsure/not heard of him. That was up from a 27 percent favorable rating in March 2010. Only 25 percent of Catholics said Benedict's leadership has helped the Church, while 15 percent said he hurt it, and 48 percent saw mixed results. In 2002, almost twice as many Catholics said Pope John Paul II had helped the church. 4:46 pm Caitlin Dewey Pope defended abdication in 2010 Pope Benedict XVI is the first pope to abdicate in living memory -- a fact that has led many to question whether popes can step down at all. An analysis in the National Catholic Reporter on Monday ruled that abdication is allowed, though there's little historical precedent. The Reporter also found that Benedict has defended the practice himself. In \"Light of the World,\" his 2010 book-length interview with journalist Peter Seewald, the pope said: \"If a Pope clearly realizes that he is no longer physically, psychologically, and spiritually capable of handling the duties of his office, then he has a right and, under some circumstances, also an obligation to resign ... \"When the danger is great one must not run away. For that reason, now is certainly not the time to resign. Precisely at a time like this one must stand fast and endure the situation. That is my view. One can resign at a peaceful moment or when one simply cannot go on. But one must not run away from danger and say someone else should do it.\" Benedict's resignation letter, which discussed his failing health, echoed the 2010 statement. 4:38 pm Caitlin Dewey Papal frontrunners on Twitter When Pope Benedict XVI joined Twitter last year, he generated a huge amount of online buzz for an institution that's often criticized for its approach to the Internet. Benedict's @Pontifex account has attracted more than 1.5 million followers with just 34 tweets. And while that figure is an improvement over no Twitter presence, the pope's account is only the 763rd most popular account on Twitter. So, how might his successors fair?

       "4208  He once drove a bus across the gritty streets of Caracas, Venezuela’s capital, and later rose through the ranks of the trade union movement.Now Nicolas Maduro, Venezuela’s tall, broad-shouldered 50-year-old vice president, has been anointed as the possible successor to President Hugo Chavez, should the populist leader’s recurring cancer force him from power.The president’s decision to name Maduro as his heir astonished the oil-rich country, where many view Chavez as a messiah-like leader with no equal after 14 years in power.In a dramatic televised address Saturday, Chavez extolled Maduro as having the “heart of a man of the people.” With Maduro seated at his left, Chavez said he had proved his mettle by loyally serving the government for years, the past six as foreign minister, hopscotching the globe.“He is a complete revolutionary, a man of great experience despite his youth, with great dedication and capacity for work, for leading, for handling the most difficult situations,” said Chavez, 58, a former lieutenant colonel who took office in 1999. “I’ve seen it. We’ve all seen it.”The president said that it was his “firm opinion, clear like a full moon, irrevocable, absolute, total” that Venezuelans should vote for Maduro should Chavez’s condition sideline him and trigger a new presidential election. The constitution requires an election within 30 days of a president being forced from office.Political analysts said the announcement appeared designed with two purposes in mind: to signal Chavez’s strong support for one man and to quell Maduro’s rivals within the president’s movement, known as Chavismo. Early Monday, 27 hours after his address, Chavez boarded a flight to Cuba, where he is to undergo his fourth operation in 18 months on the stubborn cancer in his pelvic area.“He has to make sure those inside will respect him, that he is able to control and tame the internal monsters,” Luis Vicente Leon, who runs the Datanalisis polling firm in Caracas, said of Chavez. “There are divisions in Chavismo, and strong ones, and they can be dangerous in the future if not managed.”Leon said that in Maduro, the president has a time-tested leader who has risen from street-level socialist activist to president of the National Assembly to foreign minister, a post he continues to hold. In October, Chavez named Maduro his vice president, giving him more prominence in a government where cabinet members are juggled and ousted frequently.“Look where Nicolas is going, the bus driver,” Chavez said at the time.Those who’ve known Maduro describe him as jovial and friendly, a man who enjoys socializing and eating sub sandwiches. But he also apparently has a spiritual side: He used to travel to India with his wife, Cilia Flores, also a Chavez loyalist, to hear the advice of Sathya Sai Babaa, a guru who had a worldwide following until his death in 2011.Chavez, who met Maduro in the 1980s when he led a clandestine group of rebellious army officers, had other options. His older brother, Adan, introduced him to radical politics. His former vice president, Elias Jaua, who rose up from university rabble-rouser, has been a fixture. Then there is National Assembly President Diosdado Cabello, a former military man and coup plotter whose name means “God-given hair.”An old friend and associate of Maduro, Vladimir Villegas, said that choosing the vice president made the most sense.“He is a leader who has credibility on the street, who comes from the union movement, who has been a diplomat, who brings together all the conditions,” said Villegas, a former deputy foreign minister who broke with the government in 2007. “I think it is a good decision by the president. This calms those who fear a military man who’s not Chavez.”Venezuelans are accustomed to seeing a serious-sounding Maduro inaugurate infrastructure projects or make revolutionary pronouncements from foreign capitals. But Maduro can also get emotional about Chavez’s self-described revolution and his loyalty to the president.“Chavez has a people at his side. He has us and he will have us always in this battle, from one victory to another!” Maduro, holding back tears, said Monday in an address in Venezuela. “Beyond this life we’ll be loyal to Hugo Chavez!”Unlike several Chavez associates who served in the military, Maduro was in the Socialist League movement in the 1970s and traveled to Cuba for lessons in union organizing. After serving on the assembly that rewrote Venezuela’s constitution after Chavez took office, Maduro began his rise in government.But it has been as foreign minister that he has won even the respect of some of the government’s adversaries. Maduro worked to build close ties to powers such as Russia and China, which has given billions in loans to Venezuela. Officials in Colombia, meanwhile, say Maduro has played an important role in President Juan Manuel Santos’s nascent peace process with a 48-year-old communist guerrilla movement.Despite Chavez’s public show of confidence, Maduro does not face an easy road to power, should the president resign or die. The most apparent challenge is that he is not Chavez, nor does he have the charisma or same mystical connection with the poor that the president enjoys.“Charisma is something that is earned and it’s not passed down just through an election or tapping someone as your successor,” said Susan Eckstein, director of the Latin America studies program at Boston University. If the cancer forces Chavez aside, Maduro faces an energized opposition led by Henrique Capriles, a 40-year-old lawyer who was defeated handily by Chavez in an October presidential election. But Capriles has done well in past polls against Chavez’s associates, including Maduro.Some observers also say that even with the president’s call on Saturday for “unity, unity, unity” among his associates, Maduro may be unable to hold together the divergent political interests evident in Chavismo.Some of Chavez’s lieutenants – perhaps most notably Cabello, who is close to the powerful military wing – have their own supporters and resources, said Raul Salazar, a former general who once worked closely with the president.“I don’t think it will be very easy for Maduro because groups that had been repressed will awaken,” Salazar said. “The power is concentrated for Chavez and if Chavez is there it’s there for him. But once he’s gone, it dilutes.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",

       "5408  A Spanish-language ad from Mitt Romney's campaign ties President Obama to three Latin American figures hated in Florida's Cuban population: Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, former Cuban leader Fidel Castro and communist revolutionary Che Guevara.The ad has not been released by the campaign; the Miami Herald caught it on Spanish-language TV in Miami, where the paper says it is running frequently. (Update: It is now on Romney's YouTube page.)The ad features clips of Chavez and Mariela Castro (Fidel Castro's niece) saying they would vote for Obama if they could. The narrator adds that \"to top it off, Obama's Environmental Protection Agency sent e-mails for Hispanic Heritage month with a photo of Che Guevara.\" More on that e-mail here; the EPA says it was sent by a staffer without approval. Both Chavez and Castro did say they would vote for Obama. Polls give Romney a slight edge in Florida. He needs strong support from Cuban Americans to win. The full translation, courtesy of the Herald: NARRATOR: Who supports Barack Obama?CHAVEZ: \"If I were American, I'd vote for Obama.\"NARRATOR: Raúl Castro's daughter, Mariela Castro, would vote for Obama.CASTRO: \"I would vote for President Obama.\"NARRATOR: And to top it off, Obama's Environmental Protection Agency sent e-mails for Hispanic Heritage month with a photo of Che Guevara.CHAVEZ:

       "5777  HUGO CHAVEZ may be dead, but the offensive he led against democratic institutions in Venezuela and across Latin America has not slackened. In fact, it may be accelerating, especially with regard to independent media.Last week the beleaguered owner of the last Venezuelan television station not subservient to the government announced that he was selling his shares to a businessman close to the ruling party. Guillermo Zuloaga, the majority owner of the Globovision network, was forced into exile in the United States in 2010 by the Chavez regime; now his network faces financial ruin because of repeated, multimillion-dollar fines levied on its news coverage. “We are in a completely polarized country on the opposite end of an all-powerful government that wants to see us fail,” Mr. Zuloaga explained.The silencing of Globovision will leave Venezuela with nine television networks, including five that are state owned and broadcast nearly incessant government propaganda that the four privately-owned channels won’t dare to challenge. The story of Globovision explains why. The network was charged with “sowing panic” for reporting on an earthquake, fined $2.2 million for its coverage of a bloody prison riot and, most recently, accused again of spreading panic for questioning whether the delay of Mr. Chavez’s presidential inauguration during his final illness violated the constitution — which it clearly did.The assault on the free press is by no means limited to Venezuela. In Argentina, President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner also has been trying to silence critical media, including leading newspapers such as La Nación, Clarín and Perfil. Last month her commerce minister ordered private supermarkets and appliance retailers, including Wal-Mart and Carrefour, to stop their media advertising for two months.The measure was nominally intended to complement a government price freeze, but the biggest victims were the three newspapers, which are known throughout Latin America for their hard-hitting reporting and professionalism. Clarín’s advertising from these private firms fell from 264 pages in January to 61 in February, while the other papers lost 15 to 20 percent of their income. The government long ago withdrew all of its own advertising from the papers; its intent is to force them to adopt the self-censorship that has already overtaken most Argentine media.The pressure on free press is one reason why the most valuable institution of the Organization of American States is its independent Inter-American Commission on Human Rights and its rapporteur on press freedom. The rapporteur’s office has been fearless in reporting on abuses of media freedom by governments in the Western hemisphere, while the commission has issued protective orders to shield threatened journalists.Now, however, the commission and rapporteur are themselves under assault. Ecuadorian President Rafael Correa, who aspires to replace Mr. Chavez at the head of the region’s anti-democratic left, has been campaigning to defund the rapporteur’s office, limit the commission’s authority, and move its headquarters out of Washington. He has announced he will attend an OAS foreign ministers meeting next Friday to press his case. Governments that vote with Mr. Correa will essentially be sanctioning the suppression of independent media across the region; those that are democracies must stand up for free speech.Read more from Opinions: The Post’s View: Ecuador’s president, suppressing the mediaJackson Diehl: The end of a human rights heavyweight?The Post’s View: Human rights in the Western Hemisphere                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",
       "5822  CARACAS, Venezuela — Nicolas Maduro was sworn in Friday as president after a disputed presidential election that has sharply divided the country between Venezuelans who want to continue the socialist system begun by his charismatic predecessor, Hugo Chavez, and those who contend that the ruling party won through a fraudulent vote.The inauguration, which many Latin American leaders but no U.S. diplomat attended, came a day after the National Electoral Council ruled that an audit of Sunday’s voting could take place. The decision mollified opposition leader Henrique Capriles, who said that by reviewing millions of votes “we can show the country the truth.”For Chavistas, as those in government call themselves, the inauguration of Maduro signaled the continuation of Chavez’s self-styled revolutionary government, now in its 15th year in power.“I’m president of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela,” said Maduro, 50, using the name Chavez gave Venezuela to reflect the importance of independence-era hero Simon Bolivar. “I am going to govern this country the next few years. I’ll know what I’m going to do. I have the know-how. The commander, Hugo Chavez, prepared me to assume responsibilities.”But Maduro’s presidency started off shakily, with a man in the ruling party red storming the podium in the National Assembly and grabbing at the microphone as the new leader began his inauguration speech. State television quickly turned the cameras elsewhere for viewers nationwide, and Maduro was unhurt as bodyguards seized the intruder.“The security has failed completely,” Maduro said. “They could have shot me.”He then said that the incident was a reminder of the importance of security — a reference to the larger message he has hammered all week, that his government needs to guard against coup plotters who he says want to oust him with the Obama administration’s help.“Fascists!” Maduro said. “They disguise themselves, but they have very evil intentions against not just our people but against the people of the continent.”Before the presidents of Argentina, Brazil, Cuba, Iran and several other countries, Maduro characterized his government as a peaceful model of hope facing down a threat that he equated with Nazi Germany. He pledged to defeat his opponents, not just for Venezuela’s sake but for the good of Latin America.“We need to act on time,” he said in rambling comments that lasted nearly two hours. “Europe did not act fast enough against the Nazi threat.”Inauguration protestedMaduro’s presidency starts off at a time of intense political crisis, with the opposition claiming that it won the election by a hair, citing hundreds of irregularities in polling booths nationwide. The electoral council said Maduro won by nearly 270,000 votes out of 14.9 million cast, a margin of victory of less than 2 percent.The uncertainty means that Maduro, a former bus driver and union activist, lacks the political mandate that Chavez enjoyed in one electoral victory after another. Chavez, who first won office in 1998, died last month after a battle with cancer, plunging his followers into grief and prompting Sunday’s snap election to decide who would finish his term.“To be able to do anything with the country deeply divided and 49 percent of the population questioning if you even have a right to be president is going into it with your hands tied behind your back,” said Cynthia Arnson, who directs the Latin America program at Washington’s Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars.As Maduro was inaugurated, protesters banged pots and pans from doorways and windows and played salsa music, as Capriles had requested in a Twitter message.Still, the streets were less tense after the electoral council’s decision on the audit, which was a surprising reversal because that body is stacked with government supporters. Earlier in the week, the council insisted that a review of the voting was not necessary, fending off demands by the opposition for a vote-by-vote recount.That led to street demonstrations Monday and Tuesday that government officials said left eight people dead and dozens wounded. Then on Thursday, Tibisay Lucena, the head of the council, said an audit of 12,000 boxes loaded with votes would be conducted, taking a month to complete.The examination by technicians will include comparing the paper receipts that were emitted by voting machines with a registry of the voters who cast ballots at each machine.Though he had initially asked for a more extensive and complex recount, Capriles, 40, a lawyer and governor, said the council’s decision creates a possibility of resolving the crisis. “We know where the problems were,” he said, “in those 12,000 is where the problems were.”The government said 54 percent of the vote had already been checked after the voting Sunday. Now, the council said it will scrutinize the other 46 percent of the votes.Capriles said his campaign had detected 3,200 voting irregularities, including gunmen at polling stations, rolls that included dead voters and polling stations where opposition officials were forced out.Decrying the oppositionMeanwhile, state-run TV and radio stations continued to paint a picture of the opposition as a violent, anti-democratic force whose leaders go to drastic ends to thwart the voice of the people. Broadcasts feature one official after another accusing Capriles and his closest aides of planning violence and threatening legal action.Maduro and other officials have said the opposition has even attacked clinics. “These are crimes that are a product of racism, social racism,” the new president said in his inauguration, adding that his foes targeted Cuban medical personnel in particular.Capriles has shot back that the government staged the violence to blame its adversaries and sway public opinion while launching a crackdown leading to beatings and detentions. “Stop chasing the people, stop,” Capriles said Thursday, directing his comments at Maduro.Arnson, the Woodrow Wilson analyst, said that the electoral council’s decision and Maduro’s acceptance were positive developments. But she also wondered how it would turn out, with Maduro now the president.“Venezuela excels in bizarre situations in governance,” she said. “So you have agreed to an audit that takes a month to do and at the same time you have Maduro being inaugurated.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",
       "5871  CARACAS, Venezuela — On aisle seven, among the diapers and fabric softener, the socialist dreams of the late Venezuelan president Hugo Chávez looked as ragged as the toilet paper display.Employees at the Excelsior Gama supermarket had set out a load of extra-soft six-roll packs so large that it nearly blocked the aisle. To stock the shelves with it would have been pointless. Soon word spread that the long-awaited rolls had arrived, and despite a government-imposed limit of one package per person, the checkout lines stretched all the way to the decimated dairy case in the back of the store.“This is so depressing,” said Maria Plaza, 30, a lawyer, an hour and a half into her wait. “Pathetic.”Depressing, in an otherwise bright, modern supermarket that sells $100 bottles of Spanish wine, Jack Daniel’s whiskey and organic rice puffs.Pathetic, in a country with the world’s largest petroleum reserves and oil prices at nearly $95 a barrel, yet unable to supply basic goods because of its crumbling local currency and a shortage of U.S. dollars.“Soon we’ll be using newspaper, just like they do in Cuba!” said an elderly man nearby, inching forward in line. “Yeah! Like Cuba!” others shouted.The fate of Venezuela’s revolution, it seems, will be decided at the supermarket.Nearly a year after Chávez’s death of complications from cancer at age 58, his handpicked successor, Nicolás Maduro, is struggling to contain food shortages, spiraling inflation and rampant crime.The arrival of basic staples such as cooking oil, chicken, flour or milk brings Venezuelans running to supermarkets and touches off surreal mob scenes, even as the government imposes price caps and rationing to prevent hoarding.Maduro squeaked past opposition candidate Henrique Capriles in April’s presidential election, and Maduro’s United Socialist Party won enough races in Dec. 8 local elections to push back against perceptions that Chávez loyalists were deserting him. Just before the vote, with television cameras rolling, he sent soldiers into an appliance store accused of price gouging and ordered huge markdowns on televisions and microwaves. Apparently it gave his party a final boost at the polls.Only the shortages and overall sense of unraveling seemed to have worsened since then.Each day the arrival of a new item at Excelsior Gama brought Venezuelans flooding into the store: for flour, beef, sugar. Store employees and security guards helped themselves to the goods first, clogging the checkout lines, and then had to barricade the doors to hold back the surge at the entrance.“The store owners are doing this on purpose, to increase sales,” said Marjorie Urdaneta, a government supporter who said she believes Maduro when he accuses businesses of colluding with foreign powers to wage “economic war” against him.“He should tell the stores: Make these items available — or else,” she said.But store managers said they are putting scarce, price-capped supplies out on the floor as soon as they arrive from government-run distribution centers.Venezuela’s real problem, economists say, is that a shortage of U.S. dollars is squeezing the ability of the government and the private sector to import. Even in upscale Caracas shopping malls, international chain stores such as Zara and Gucci are gutted, their employees standing around with nothing to sell and the mannequins left naked.While the government has fixed the exchange rate of the country’s currency, the “strong bolivar,” at 6.3 to the dollar, the widely used street rate is more than 10 times higher. Inflation was 56 percent last year — officially — and in an oil-warped economy that depends heavily on imported goods, businesses can’t get the dollars they need to restock their shelves. Even Venezuelan-made items go scarce as factories struggle to obtain replacement parts and raw materials.Political breathing roomVenezuela’s parliament has granted Maduro temporary decree powers, and analysts say he has the political breathing room this year to make unpopular economic adjustments, such as raising state-regulated gas prices, the lowest in the world. “The distortions have become too large,” said economist Luis Zambrano. “And this year is the first in a long time that there are no elections.”Maduro’s government also plans to grease the wheels by selling at least $5 billion in U.S. money — at nearly twice the official rate — to companies trying to shed bolivars and secure hard currency. Economists liken this to a de-facto devaluation — a recognition that the strong bolivar is, in fact, quite wimpy.After his annual address to parliament last month, Maduro declared 2014 “the year of the ultimate triumph in the economic war,” announced a new team of economic managers and decreed a law capping business profits at 30 percent.“You can be sure we will be inspecting everyone, sooner or later,” Maduro warned, part of the “New Economic Order” he vows to create.‘Too dangerous to go out’But if the president’s fiscal policies are anything like his response to rising crime, the country looks to be in trouble.The Jan. 6 roadside killing of former Miss Venezuela Monica Spear in a botched robbery attempt jolted a country long-numbed by one of the world’s highest homicide rates and near-total criminal impunity. Fear is so widespread that shopping mall kiosks offer “Express Armoring” for motorists who want their vehicles bulletproofed, fast.Despite calls for an overhaul of Venezuela’s woeful police forces, Maduro said violent soap operas were to blame and warned broadcasters to clean up their content.Most Venezuelans are too busy just trying to secure the basics. Residents from the country’s interior say the shortages are even worse outside the capital.“There’s nothing to buy where we live,” said Maria Valencia, a preschool teacher from the oil-producing hub of Maracaibo, near Venezuela’s western border, while shopping at a government-run Bicentenario supermarket where products sold by recently nationalized companies carried little heart symbols and the phrase “Made in Socialism.”Valencia and three family members had filled their cart with corn oil, four bottles each, the maximum. “This stuff is gold,” she said.Shoppers here were more inclined to blame the scarcities on badly behaved countrymen whom they said were trying to profit from the situation.“All Venezuelans are to blame for this,” said Jeanpierre Sifontes with a shrug, his cart loaded with cooking oil, discount beef imported from Brazil and two Sony-brand karaoke machines.“We need something to do at night because it’s too dangerous to go out,” Sifontes said.Maduro, like Chávez, still counts on the broad support of the poor Venezuelans who have benefited from a reallocation of the country’s oil wealth, such as the new government apartment towers all over Caracas, the city’s expanding subway system and even cable-car gondolas to ferry poor favela dwellers high up into the hillside slums.But with the country’s economy wobbling and inflation falling heaviest on the poor, Maduro isn’t taking any chances, and many of his recent moves have put military officers in key government posts.As a former paratrooper, Chávez didn’t need to prove his mettle to the country’s armed forces, said Margarita Lopez, a political analyst in Caracas. But Maduro is less secure and seems to be trying to win loyalty by steering more power and resources to the military.“The military was never this visible under Chávez,” Lopez said. “It’s going to be a very difficult year.”Emilia Diaz-Struck contributed to this report.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",
       "5974  CARACAS, Venezuela — A vast crowd of red-clad Venezuelans filled the streets of the capital Wednesday to mourn President Hugo Chavez, as governments across Latin America began looking ahead to an election that will determine his successor and the direction of the South American energy giant.Chavez’s flag-draped coffin was slowly carried through the streets of Caracas over the course of the day, on a route winding toward the military academy where he started his career as a young cadet from a poor rural family. His body will lie in state there until his official burial on Friday.Chanting “Chavez lives!” the mourners poured into central Caracas from rough hillside barrios and rural towns, vowing that their hero’s self-styled socialist revolution would endure beyond his death.“He gave us the instructions and we will all follow them. We are all Chavez,” said Elia Cuba, a 59-year-old accountant.Specifically, Chavez instructed his supporters to vote for Nicolas Maduro, the country’s interim president and the man now tapped to carry forth the leftist blend of socialism, nationalism and electoral patronage known as “Bolivarianism,” after 19th-century independence hero Simon Bolivar, Chavez’s idol.Even as several of Chavez’s closest allies arrived in Caracas to bid farewell, governments were scrambling to calculate what his death might mean beyond Venezuela. Although he irritated the United States with his alliance with Iran, Chavez built many relationships through his leftist ideology and multibillion-dollar oil diplomacy, which injected Venezuela and its shaky politics into many economies.Chavez forged particularly close ties to Cuba, providing Havana with about 100,000 barrels of subsidized oil a day, and receiving in return thousands of Cuban workers, from intelligence agents to doctors and sports trainers.“Latin America has never had a more generous benefactor than Chavez,” said Michael Shifter, president of the Washington think tank Inter-American Dialogue.“His death doesn’t mean an abrupt cutoff of such aid, but it will probably result in a gradual reduction, especially as economic difficulties and fiscal pressures become more acute in Venezuela,” Shifter said, citing the country’s huge debts, soaring inflation and chronic shortages.Chavez was the first of a wave of Latin American leftist leaders who have won and held on to office since the Cold War era, and now figures such as Ecuador’s Rafael Correa, Bolivia’s Evo Morales and Argentina’s Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner say they will carry on Chavez’s goals for regional integration.The government has announced that an election will be held within a month, but with no date set, speculation is growing that Maduro could try to schedule the vote for as soon as possible, capitalizing on the emotions unleashed by Chavez’s death after a nearly two-year bout with cancer.Maduro is expected to face opposition leader Henrique Capriles, who lost to Chavez by 11 percentage points in October’s presidential election.‘He awoke a people’Among Chavez followers there are also fears of a potential power struggle between Maduro and another Chavez loyalist, National Assembly President Diosdado Cabello. “We want Nicolas [Maduro],” said Nelly Leticia Castillo, 50, choking up with emotion as she said her farewell. “I hope he and Diosdado can come together.”David Smilde, a Venezuela expert at the University of Georgia, said he did not expect significant changes to come to Latin America following Chavez’s death, given that the leader’s endorsement is likely to boost Maduro at the polls.“First, Maduro, who will likely win the presidency in the coming elections, was his foreign minister for the past six years and architect of Venezuela’s involvement in the region,” Smilde said.“Chavez’s legacy is his legacy, and there will likely be continuity,” he said.Throughout the day Wednesday, Venezuela’s vast state television apparatus played Chavez’s speeches and ran footage of him hugging followers and saluting adulatory crowds. State newspapers declared that even in death he remained “the guiding light” of this country of 29 million.Chavez underwent a fourth cancer surgery in Cuba on Dec. 11 and never recovered, nor did he appear publicly again. He died at a military hospital here at 4:25 p.m. Tuesday, two weeks after arriving from Havana, where he was being treated, in the middle of the night.Marlenis Vanegar, 75, said she had prayed for the president outside the military hospital, where groups of Chavistas — as Chavez’s followers call themselves — had gathered for vigils. “He left a legacy for us,” she said. “He awoke a people. Don’t anyone think that this revolution will now be lost. We will continue with the candidate that he left for us.”Unofficial campaignThe death of the leader seemed, at least for the moment, to bring a sense of relative calm to Venezuela, with the volume turned down on the political vitriol that had characterized the discourse of government officials and Chavez opponents in recent days.“In the immense pain of this historic tragedy that has affected our fatherland, we call on all the compatriots to be vigilant for peace, love, respect and tranquility,” Maduro said on national TV. “We ask our people to channel this pain into peace.”Capriles told the country that now was “not the time to highlight what separates us.”Still, as Chavez lay in agony in recent days, it had begun to appear as if an unofficial campaign had already begun, with Maduro and Capriles directing highly personal attacks against each other. In a tense political environment, much of the country was talking about what would come after Chavez’s death. Now, Venezuelans are awaiting word on when the election will be held.In the meantime, the Interior Ministry ordered a ban on alcohol sales and the carrying of guns in public through Tuesday.The country is also wondering where Chavez will be buried. The leader had ordered a huge modernist mausoleum built for Bolivar — a structure that critics say looks like a skateboard ramp — in the center of Caracas. And now, many wonder whether Chavez’s body will wind up there.“For his political brilliance and commitment to the country, Commander Chavez has earned his place beside the Liberator Simon Bolivar in the Pantheon,” said a longtime Chavez associate, Freddy Bernal, in comments quoted by the Reuters news agency.Nick Miroff contributed to this report                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",
       "6220  Questions are swirling as to whether President Hugo Chavez will make it back to Venezuela in time for his scheduled Jan. 10 inauguration -- or at all.While the opposition is advocating for a transfer of power to the head of the National Assembly, many Venezuelans are still praying for Chavez's swift recovery from cancer surgery, the reason he flew to Cuba on Dec. 11.[Click here for a timeline of Chavez's life]\"We have no idea what to expect. I pray for his recovery but I am expecting the worst,\" Joaquín Cavarcas told the Guardian.Formula One driver Pastor Maldonado told the Associated Press that he and millions of other Chavez supporters have \"much faith that he's recovering.\"Although Chavez's popularity has waned in recent years, he still won his most recent election by 9 percentage points. So how did Chavez, arguably an autocrat who presides over one of the most dangerous countries in South America, get so popular? Basically, welfare programs, and plenty of them. Foreign Affairs recently tallied them up:During his 14 years as president, Chávez has launched more than 27 missions, his government's name for social programs. The missions were sold as helping the poor, but no one in government ever worried much about whether the returns justified the investments, or whether the main beneficiaries really were the worst-off.Chavez has helped Venezuela's poor, but his vast stores of money seem to be reaching their limits. As the New York Times points out, \"He has given away tens of thousands of homes, but the rush to build meant that many were plagued by construction flaws or other problems. He has used price controls to make food affordable for the poor, but that has contributed to shortages in basic goods. He created a popular program of neighborhood clinics often staffed by Cuban doctors, but hospitals frequently lack basic equipment.\"Over time, these \"missions\" have amounted to billions in spending, and during election season, Chavez both piled on the money and threatened the programs' disappearance should he lose.The programs' substantial social benefits have also earned Chavez praise from international bodies, even those who otherwise criticize Venezuela for human rights infringement and high rates of violence:\"In terms of economic, social, and cultural rights, the IACHR recognizes the State's achievements with regard to the progressive observance of these rights, including, most notably, the eradication of illiteracy, the reduction of poverty, and the increase in access by the most vulnerable sectors to basic services such as health care,\" the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights wrote in 2010.“Venezuela loves Chávez with guts, heart and mind,” Ramona Caño, a Chavez supporter, told the Economist in September. Venezuela blogger Francisco Toro drew a comparison to a blissful marriage in which the husband pampers his wife while covering up household financial information, much as Toro believes Chavez has hidden the size and expenditures of his oil-revenue-filled secret state funds.In the story, Populus, or the public, is the wife, and Hugo is -- well, you guessed it:Over the years, Populus has grown accustomed to a certain lifestyle, and Hugo has made all kinds of promises that that lifestyle is built on solid rock. Populus knows Hugo had a run of good luck in recent years: he made a big windfall from his backyard mining business. But since Hugo won’t show her the statements for his savings account, she has no way of knowing how much of the windfall he saved, how much he has since spent, or how much is left on hand. Hugo likes to brag about the lovely gifts he’s bought her with the savings from that Fonden savings account, but when Populus asks to see the statements he just clams up, flat out refuses her requests. In fairness to Hugo, she doesn’t ask very often. As long as her lifestyle is sustained, she’s happy to not know. Sure, there are some signs that things may not be all that rosy. Those credit card statements are coming back fatter and fatter each month. Insofar as Populus worries about that, which isn’t actually very far at all, she’s puzzled. She knows he pays 12% interest on that credit card debt, and only gets 2 or 3% interest on his savings out of Fonden Bank. But, again, she doesn’t ask too many questions; she’s minded to trust him. And why shouldn't she? Life is great! They have this thing they do in their family where every six-years they renew their vows and boy, Hugo really makes it rain at those times. Some of Populus’s curmudgeonly uncles, though, can’t help but question her: is their lifestyle really sustainable?Now, Venezuela is left with high debt, skyrocketing inflation and a fiscal and trade deficit, a situation either Chavez or whoever succeeds him will eventually have to fix.If Chavez doesn't recover and assume a fourth term, there's no assurance that the popular programs that kept him in office will survive without him. Vice President Nicolas Maduro would likely succeed him.\"Chavez presumably selected Maduro as his vice president because he was confident that the former bus driver would continue his Bolivarian revolution,\" James Lindsay, of the Council on Foreign Relations, writes. \"Maduro may turn out to be a loyal lieutenant. But history offers up many examples of proteges who abandoned their mentor’s course or lacked the political skills to remain in power.\"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",
       "6366  A VENEZUELAN government statement Thursday said that President Hugo Chavez, who has been secreted inside a Cuban hospital since undergoing surgery on Dec. 11, was facing “complications” from “a severe lung infection.” As has been the case throughout his nearly two-year bout with cancer, details of the strongman’s condition, treatment and prognosis are unavailable. But Venezuelans are bracing themselves for the death of the caudillo who has ruled them — and wrecked their once-prosperous country — over the past 13 years. The United States and its Latin American allies need to prepare, as well.Mr. Chavez’s critical condition arrived at a critical moment: He is due to be sworn in next Thursday for another six-year term in office. Having won reelection in October after assuring Venezuelans that he was fully cured, the president disappeared soon afterward; in his last appearance before departing for Cuba, he appointed foreign minister Nicolas Maduro as his vice president and political successor. If Mr. Chavez is too ill to attend his inauguration, authorities are saying, they will simply delay it — a stretch of the constitution’s ambiguous wording. But when and if he dies, the constitution is clear: A new election for president should be held within 30 days.That will be a critical test of Venezuela’s post-Chavez direction. The ruler’s inner circle, which has been gathering around him in Cuba, may consider postponing the election or even calling it off. Their fear — and that of the Castro regime in Cuba — is that a fair vote would be won by opposition leader Henrique Capriles, who lost the October presidential ballot but is more popular than Mr. Maduro. Mr. Maduro is Cuba’s candidate, the successor most likely to ensure continued deliveries of the heavily subsidized Venezuelan oil that is keeping the Communist regime afloat.That’s why the first responsibility of the United States and Venezuelan neighbors such as Brazil should be to insist that the presidential election be held and that it be free and fair. The State Department rightly made that demand public on Thursday, following recent private contacts between officials of the two governments. The administration should be prepared to respond quickly if Mr. Chavez’s followers or military leaders — some of whom are under U.S. sanction for drug trafficking — attempt a coup.Whoever succeeds Mr. Chavez will face a catastrophic economic situation. To win reelection, Mr. Chavez spent wildly last year, increasing the budget deficit to 20 percent of gross domestic product; his successor will be forced to order a sharp and painful devaluation. That will only worsen already high inflation and shortages of staple foods. When poor Venezuelans realize that lavish pre-election promises of new apartments and appliances won’t be delivered, anger toward the new leader may swell.Sadly, the economic pain caused by Mr. Chavez could, after his death, help create a political movement that will revere his memory. Forty years after the death of Juan Peron, Peronism still haunts and holds back Argentina. If Venezuela is to escape a similar curse, Mr. Chavez’s successors will have to balance economic stabilization against the need to build a political system where democracy, and not autocratic populism, can thrive.More on this debate:The Post’s View: Hugo Chavez’s legacy: Failing to prepare Venezuela for the next leaderThe Post’s View: Chavez’s days are numberedThe Post’s View: Venezuela on fireThe Post’s View: Venezuela has a new chance                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",

November’s rate was revised higher from an initially reported 7.7 percent.” (Washington Post)Winning ugly: Obama and the fiscal cliff: “To his credit, Obama never said raising taxes on the “rich” will solve all of our problems. What he did say, however, is that he couldn’t in good conscience ask seniors and college students to take a hit from budget cuts without asking the wealthy to pay their fair share. He wanted “shared sacrifice” and a “balanced approach” because we’re “all in it together,'” writes AEI’s Jonah Goldberg. (National Review)CAP’s Matt Miller: Making future cliffs count. (Washington Post) With Karzai, taking the good with the bad: “As he prepares to visit Washington in the coming days, Afghanistan President Hamid Karzai is completing 10 years in office. His relationship with America began with mutual affection and infatuation, and deteriorated gradually over the years, first under President George W. Bush, then even more so during the early part of the Obama administration. But as in a bad marriage that stays together for the kids, both sides have continued to cooperate for the sake of their common interest in building a stable Afghanistan,” writes Brookings’ Michael O’Hanlon. (Politico)Room for Debate asks: President Hugo Chávez of Venezuela, who has led his resource-rich country with his own brand of socialism, Chavismo, for 14 years, has been indeteriorating health since his cancer surgery last month. It is not clear whether he will be able to be inaugurated for a fourth term on Jan. 10, and his chosen successor waits in the wings. If Chávez steps down or dies, what will become of Venezuela? Will Chavismo survive? What sorts of social, economic and political issues must the next president confront? Would the nation’s contentious relationship with the United States improve? (New York Times)Iran should be key topic at hearings: “It is to be hoped that the forthcoming Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearings regarding the president’s nominations for secretary of state and secretary of defense produce a wide-ranging debate regarding this country’s role in today’s very unsettled world. The hearings almost certainly will provoke searching questions regarding the strategic wisdom of potential U.S. military action against Iran. Recent Israeli media reports have cited a former member of President Obama’s National Security Council staff predicting a U.S. attack by about midyear,” writes Zbigniew Brzezinski.

       "6490  WHAT IS the hottest global market so far in 2012? How about socialist Venezuela — where stocks rose 99 percent between Jan. 1 and this week. That might seem like an improbable surge in a country wracked by double-digit inflation, shortages of water, power and staple foods, and a dearth of investment — not to mention one of the world’s highest murder rates. But Venezuela’s markets are being moved by a strange but powerful force: the absence of reliable information about the health of President Hugo Chavez — and the growing speculation that his condition is rapidly deteriorating.According to Russell M. Dallen Jr, a banker who produces a newsletter on Venezuela, a rumor that a prominent journalist had tweeted the news of Mr. Chavez’s death caused Venezuelan bond prices to spike by as much as 5 percent Friday. The rumor was false, and Mr. Chavez proved he was alive with a phone call to state television on Monday from Cuba. Yet it is Mr. Chavez who has created the feverish climate, by refusing to tell his people the truth about the cancer he has been battling, even as he insists he will be a candidate for a new six-year presidential term in elections scheduled for October.What Venezuelans know is that Mr. Chavez has had three operations in Cuba since the discovery of what he described as a “baseball-size” tumor in his pelvic area last June, including one on Feb.?26 to remove a new growth. He has had three rounds of chemotherapy and three rounds of radiation treatment, also in Cuba. What the country has not been told is what type of cancer the president suffers from or his prognosis — though Mr. Chavez’s tearful prayers at a pre-Easter service on April 5, in which he pleaded for his life, offered an ominous hint.In the vacuum created by the regime, speculation and reports based on unnamed sources are flourishing. The journalist who was the subject of last week’s rumor, Nelson Bocaranda, has reported that the cancer has spread to other organs and that treatment has been ineffective. That has helped propel Venezuelan markets, which are hoping for an end to Mr. Chavez’s disastrous mismanagement of the country. There is a good alternative: a well-organized opposition has nominated a popular state governor, Henrique Capriles Radonski, to compete in the presidential election; he has promised to rebuild democratic institutions.Yet Venezuela is threatened with much worse outcomes. Mr. Bocaranda reported last week that Venezuelan and Cuban generals met in Cuba to decide on what to do if Mr. Chavez is unable to remain in office or compete in the election — and that a military coup was one option under discussion. Though unconfirmed, that all-too-plausible possibility underlines the urgency for Venezuela’s neighbors — and an inert Obama administration — to focus on the possibility that the country may be headed for a political breakdown and to do what they can to prevent it. As a start, they should encourage Mr. Chavez to disclose his condition.Read more on this issue:Yoani Sanchez: Hugo Chavez’s secret illnessThe Post’s View: Venezuela’s new chanceJackson Diehl: Chavez

       "6892  The Snowden affair is just the kind of high-wire, global crisis that the bombastic late president of Venezuela, Hugo Chavez, would have loved.The cast of actors in the drama would be perfect for the anti-imperialist leader: There’s the young American whistleblower. Chavez’s Venezuela would have cast him as an idealistic, anti-imperialist truth teller. There are juicy American secrets and furious U.S. officials. There are big countries – Russia and China, both Venezuelan allies – jousting with the colossus Chavez simply called “The Empire,” the United States.Chavez, of course, is gone: felled by cancer in March. But no matter. His successor, Nicolas Maduro, is doing his best to make hay of the Snowden affair at the expense of the Obama administration.In fact, with Maduro and a large Venezuelan delegation in Moscow on Tuesday for an energy conference, many observers of the Snowden affair were taking bets that the former National Security Agency contractor might find his way back to Caracas on the official Venezuelan presidential plane. Maduro did little to dampen such speculation.The Venezuelan leader, who just last week said it was “almost certain” he’d bestow asylum for Snowden, spoke of little else but Snowden’s courage and American malice in one public appearance after another in Moscow.He told reporters early in the day that Snowden is a “young American who has dared to say big truths, that the imperialist elite of the United States want to control the world, that they spy on friends and foes, that they spy on the whole world, that they have created an evil system, halfway Orwellian, that intends to control the communications of the world.”He then said on Venezuelan state television that Snowden “has done humanity a favor.”Then at a theater, attending an event to commemorate Chavez, Maduro said Snowden represented disaffected Americans ready to rise up. “His gesture is a gesture of rebellion of the American youth against those who want to control, the elite from the United States who want to control the world,” Maduro said.The Venezuelan leader, who cut his teeth as a union activist in his youth, said Snowden is now being chased around the world for little reason. “And you have to ask yourself,” Maduro said, “you have a right to ask yourself as a citizen of the world, why do they chase him? How many missiles has Snowden fired against the innocent peoples of the world? Did Snowden plant bombs that killed I don’t know who? What crimes has he committed against humanity?”In interviews, though, Maduro dodged questions about whether Snowden would have a seat on his plane. He didn’t say yes. He didn’t say no.“Those are things that at this moment I can’t respond to,” he told RT, a state-financed TV network in Russia. The interviewer followed up by noting that Maduro had said last Thursday that he would likely give Snowden asylum.“Do you maintain that posture?” Maduro was asked.“Yes, I maintain that posture,” he said. “But I’ll add a new element to that posture: which is, I make a call to the youth of the world: What have you done for Snowden? What have you done for the peace of the world? That’s the question.”There’s a chance, of course, that as Maduro ponders Venezuela’s role in helping Snowden he will consider Venezuela’s relations with the U.S., which are bruised but which State Department diplomats have been trying to resuscitate.Maduro, though, has been a difficult negotiator: While professing to want better relations, he has accused U.S. agents of having caused the cancer that killed Chavez and of stoking protests in his homeland after he barely won the presidency in a disputed election rife with voting irregularities.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",
       "6993  ANTICIPATING THE death of Hugo Chavez, the Obama administration began reaching out months ago to his designated successor, Nicolas Maduro, in the hope of bettering U.S.-Venezuelan relations. On Tuesday, that strategy absorbed a body blow: Hours before revealing that Mr. Chavez had died of cancer, Mr. Maduro tried to blame the United States for his illness, and he expelled two U.S. military attaches on charges of “proposing destabilizing plans” to the armed forces.So much for the “reset” with Caracas. The ludicrous and crude propaganda launched by Mr. Maduro was a sign that Mr. Chavez’s successors will be more thuggish and less politically adept than he was — and, if anything, more inclined to scapegoat the United States and Venezuela’s democratic opposition for the horrendous problems the caudillo leaves behind.Those troubles, it should be clear, are staggering, even more so when it is considered that Venezuela, a country of less than 30 million people, collected more than $1 trillion in oil revenue during Mr. Chavez’s 14 years of increasingly autocratic rule. Its inflation is among the highest in the world, power outages are routine and consumers are plagued with shortages of basic goods. The murder rate has more than tripled, making Caracas a more dangerous city than Baghdad. Official corruption is rampant, as is drug trafficking: Seven present or former officials have been designated as narcotics kingpins by the U.S. Treasury.Perhaps most dangerous of all for the motley crew that inherits this legacy, Venezuelans have been grossly and cynically deceived. Mr. Chavez assured them he was healthy when he campaigned for reelection last year, even though he surely knew his illness was terminal. As recently as this month, polls showed that the regime’s propaganda had led a majority of Venezuelans to believe that he would soon resume his duties. The government can no more explain Mr. Chavez’s seemingly sudden demise than it can deliver on the extravagant promises he made in his last months, including a mass giveaway of apartments and appliances.It’s little wonder the United States is being blamed. Since his youth, Mr. Maduro has been a client of the Castro regime in Cuba, which depends on Venezuela for 60 percent of its energy. The Venezuelan transition has been orchestrated from Havana, where Mr. Chavez was secluded from December until two weeks ago; anti-American hysteria is the Castros’ oldest wheeze.The only mystery here is why the Obama administration is focusing its diplomacy on courting Mr. Maduro and his cronies. Venezuela’s constitution says a new presidential election must take place within 30 days, and Mr. Maduro will face a challenge from opposition leader Henrique Capriles, who has twice defeated Chavez lieutenants in gubernatorial elections, most recently in December. Nor is it clear that Mr. Chavez’s followers will unite behind Cuba’s favorite; the Venezuelan military and politicians close to it are said to be resistant to Havana’s tutelage.A sensible U.S. policy in these circumstances would start with insistence on a fair, democratic vote to determine Mr. Chavez’s successor and with the defense of peaceful political actors, such as the Venezuelan students whose protest campground was attacked and burned in the hours after Mr. Chavez’s death. Further wooing of Mr. Maduro should wait until he survives the scrum in his own party, wins a free vote and demonstrates that he is more than a Castro puppet.Read more on this subject:Marie Arana: Hugo Chavez — where Marx met OprahJackson Diehl: Chavez is not going quietly                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
       "7061  RIO DE JANEIRO — On every stage where a Latin American leader launched into soaring oratory against the imperialists, Fidel Castro was present.In every lonely jungle hideout where guerrillas in olive-drab plotted their fight, Castro kept them company. In every country where revolutionaries and communists dreamed of creating a workers’ paradise, Castro was a guiding light.No single figure did more to define generations of Latin Americans who sought political upheaval than Castro. His anti-American rants inspired followers in countries that also saw resources sucked away by local elites in cahoots with the mighty United States. In nations with extreme inequality, governments took lessons from his state-run economic model. For modern-day strongmen looking for high-minded justifications to seize control of parliaments, courts and the media, he was the man.These days, many Latin American countries’ political and economic ties with Cuba have weakened because of painful recessions and voters’ rejection of leftist governments. Leftists in Latin America have little interest in armed revolution anymore. Still, Cuba’s influence in the region endures, both because of its advances in education and health care, and because of its example of fierce independence.“Yesterday the greatest of all Latin Americans died,” former Brazilian president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva wrote on his Facebook page Saturday.In the 60 years since Castro and his comrades sailed to Cuba from the coast of Mexico to launch their unlikely rebellion, his story has been an example for leftists in the region who took up arms against their governments.Some, like Castro, transitioned to political leadership and pressed for greater spending on the poor. Dilma Rousseff in Brazil and José Mujica in Uruguay fought against military dictatorships before eventually becoming presidents, while current leaders such as Daniel Ortega in Nicaragua and Salvador Sánchez Cerén in El Salvador were prominent guerrillas in Cold War battles against U.S.-backed regimes.“Dreamers and progressive militants, everyone who fights for social justice and for a less unequal world, we all woke up sad this Saturday,” Rousseff wrote on her blog.Castro’s Cuba provided moral support for small Latin American countries pushing back against institutions such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund that wanted painful austerity measures. When Colombia’s main rebel group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), needed a place to talk peace in recent years with that country’s leaders after a half-century of war, they found it in Cuba. While the “pink tide” of leftist governments that swept across Latin America in the early 2000s has ebbed, with more-conservative leaders taking power in several countries, Castro’s followers and allies are still a force in the region.One can see Castro’s shadow in places such as Evo Morales’s Bolivia and Rafael Correa’s Ecuador. These long-serving South American leaders, who consider Castro an inspiration, have distanced their countries from the United States, overseen constitutional changes that extended their rule, and spent heavily on welfare programs in the name of a “21st-century socialism.”Morales, a former coca grower who rose to prominence opposing U.S.-funded eradication efforts, has described Castro as a “father,” and analysts think the Cuban’s example helped Morales broaden his message beyond the coca fields. On Saturday, Morales choked up as he paid tribute to Castro.“He accompanied us,” Morales said. “He guided us. Fidel oriented us and the Cuban people to raise our voices against those who imposed the politics of domination .?.?. to ransack our natural resources.”While Castro is a symbol across Latin America, few places still try to replicate his Soviet- inspired economic system. One exception is Venezuela, an oil-producing country that instituted its own socialist model after former military officer Hugo Chávez came to power in 1999. When Chávez died in 2013, Castro described him as “the best friend Cuba ever had.”Chávez’s government modeled its health-care and literacy programs on Cuba’s. While Venezuela shipped cheap oil to the island, Cuban doctors and teachers fanned out into poor neighborhoods of Venezuela to teach and provide medical care.“Cuban support was fundamental for developing [these] social programs,” said Nicmer Evans, a Venezuelan political analyst.The Chávez government’s heavy subsidies for such things as milk and corn flour helped poor Venezuelans in times of high oil revenue but are difficult to sustain now that petroleum prices have slumped. The country is suffering extreme shortages of food and medicine, rampant inflation and growing social unrest. Chávez’s successor, Nicolás Maduro, is fighting off an opposition effort to oust him from the presidency.In other parts of Latin America, Castro’s influence has been more symbolic. In Mexico, student activists still wear hats and T-shirts featuring pictures of Cuban revolutionaries. But Castro has generally been seen by Mexican politicians as a convenient friend rather than someone to emulate.Most Latin American countries cut diplomatic ties with Cuba after Castro’s revolution, while Mexico recognized the new regime in the face of stiff U.S. resistance. Mexico, though, was using its diplomatic tools more to gain leverage with the United States than to pursue Cuba-style policies.“There was always this idea in Mexican diplomacy that they supported causes that were against the United States in order to negotiate with the Americans,” said Ilán Semo, a historian at the Ibero-American University in Mexico City.While Cuba helped foment rebellion in other Latin American countries in the 1960s, ’70s and ’80s, Castro resisted doing that in Mexico.Several countries with socialist-inspired leaders, such as Chile’s Michelle Bachelet and Brazil’s Lula and his successor, Rousseff, had good relations with Cuba but pursued more market-friendly economic policies while expanding social programs.While Castro’s economic approach has lost popularity, Latin American countries remember him more for his focus on health care, education and better conditions for the poor.“For the peoples of our continent and the workers of our poorest countries, especially for the men and women of my generation, Fidel was always a voice of struggle and hope,” Lula wrote.Cid Benjamin, a former member of an armed Brazilian leftist group in the 1960s, considers himself part of a generation “formed by the influence of the Cuban revolution.”He now sees Cuba’s health and education systems as Castro’s most important regional legacies.“It has an influence on the whole left,” Benjamin said. For years, Cuba has sent doctors and teachers to provide services in countries such as Venezuela, Brazil and Angola, earning hard currency in the process.Under Rousseff, Brazil brought in 11,000 Cuban doctors to work in gritty suburbs and isolated rural areas, where middle-class Brazilian doctors were often reluctant to practice. It’s a Cuban legacy a generation of poorer Brazilians is unlikely to forget.Partlow reported from Olympia, Wash.

       "7214  CARACAS, Venezuela — Fighting for his political life, President Hugo Chavez overcame a vigorous challenge by Henrique Capriles in Sunday’s presidential election, receiving another six-year term that will give the populist firebrand the opportunity to complete the consolidation of what he calls 21st century socialism in one of the world’s great oil powers.The victory, announced by the National Electoral Council late Sunday, gave Chavez the win with 54.4 percent of the vote, while Capriles took 44.9 percent. In winning his fourth presidential election since 1998, Chavez captured just over 7.4 million votes to 6.1 million for his adversary, turning back what had been a determined battle by Capriles, a 40-year-old former governor.“I congratulate the opposition and the directors of the opposition, because they recognize the victory of the people,” Chavez told throngs of supporters gathered outside the presidential palace. “That’s why I send them this salute and put out my arms to them, because we are all brothers in the fatherland of Bolivar.”Half an hour later, Capriles conceded at his campaign headquarters. But he signaled that the support of millions of Venezuelans showed that his proposals had struck a chord. And he asked that Chavez, who often mocks his foes as oligarchs and lackeys of U.S. imperialism, take the opposition’s needs into account.“I’m convinced that this country can be better,” Capriles said in a halting, emotional speech. “Being a good president means working for all Venezuelans.”Chavez’s victory touched off wild celebrations in the capital, where crowds of the president’s red-shirted supporters — the “Chavistas” from the poorest barrios who have been the backbone of his movement — set off fireworks and blew horns.“You can’t do better than this president,” said Miguel Guevara, 77, who sells books in the streets and voted in a poor barrio whose support helped bring Chavez to power. “The only one who has helped the country is named Hugo Chavez.”The president of the electoral council, Tibisay Lucena, said more than 80 percent of the country’s nearly 19 million registered voters participated in the election.“To the participants who didn’t get victory, consider yourselves victors, too,” she said in making her announcement to loud cheers among Chavez’s supporters. “To participate in an electoral process like this one, in democracy, is a victory for the whole people of Venezuela. The entire country has won.”Chavez still faces a host of challenges that were highlighted by Capriles’s focused, well-organized campaign, in which the youthful lawyer — known as “Skinny” to his followers — hammered the government daily for the country’s decaying infrastructure, increasing dependence on oil exports and inability to control one of the world’s highest homicide rates.A largely forgotten topic in recent months that may again become a major issue is the tumor in Chavez’s pelvic region that he has said was removed this year. Although he announced that he was cured after months of chemotherapy and radiation therapy, details about his health remain a state secret.The president was clearly slowed by the cancer during the campaign, which served to highlight Capriles’s vigor. The man known as El Comandante to his followers appeared bloated, had to walk gingerly and could no longer speak to crowds for hours at a time, as had been his custom.Carlos Romero, a political analyst here who has closely tracked the election, said that despite Chavez’s victory, his economic model of state interventions has failed. That failure, Romero said, coupled with Chavez’s questionable health, meant that this is likely to be the last major win for the president.“What I am clear about is that this is the last victory for Chavez,” said Romero, who had predicted Chavez’s victory in the election. “The cycle is closing.”After coming to prominence in the 1990s after a failed attempt to seize power, Chavez, a former army paratrooper, won a series of elections: referendums that led to a new constitution and ended term limits and a vote that turned back a recall referendum in 2004.But Chavez lost a 2007 referendum that would have given him a raft of new powers, and the opposition won more votes in elections staged in 2010 for lawmakers in the country’s National Assembly.Venezuelans flooded polling stations Sunday, each side determined to choose between two starkly different candidates: one who offers a powerful state that nationalizes companies and spends freely on social programs with petrodollars and another who offered a more business-friendly government that would rebuild tattered relations with the United States.“It’s not only about a president but about a whole political system — socialism or democratic, so it’s very important for us,” said David Fermin, 44, an economist who voted in a leafy upper-class neighborhood that was supportive of Capriles.The president’s campaign, though, was disciplined and loyal, and well before dawn bugles sounded in the poor barrios that have come out for him in force many times. That got voters to the polls, where lines started to form before 5 a.m. for openings an hour later.For those most fervent of followers, Chavez has been a leader like no other — he has spent heavily, using billions of dollars under his control to start small-scale social programs that provide everything from cheap food to basic medical care in the tumbledown barrios that carpet the hills of this and other cities.Lilian Gonzalez, 60, who takes care of children, praised Chavez and said that the run-up to the election had been anguishing for her because she feared that the president would be defeated and that the country would “go back to the past.”“Here, the poorest people now have meals three times a day,” she said, explaining one reason why she supported Chavez.Chavez has long used his oratorical gifts and the oil money he controls through his office to cast himself as a father figure to the poor, creating a near-religious connection with his followers, one that has never been easy for the opposition to break.In the campaign, he heaped scorn on Capriles, calling him everything from a “fascist” to a “mediocre bootlicker.”“Who’s going to debate with you?” Chavez said in one recent speech, after Capriles challenged him to a debate. “Learn how to talk first.”He argued that Capriles would represent the interests of the United States, not the poor, and that his government would slash popular social programs, a claim that Capriles had to repeatedly deny.The attacks had an impact.Javier Alejandro Piñango, 33, a delivery driver, said he didn’t trust Capriles, arguing that the contender had tried to fashion himself as a populist like Chavez.“The other candidate has no proposal, he has no spark,” Piñango said as he cast his ballot in a poor neighborhood. “That is what I like about El Comandante and what he has done. He has changed things and has also awakened us. And the country is better.”Capriles, noting the government’s heavy spending on the campaign and its overwhelming control of the airwaves, compared himself frequently to David and Chavez to Goliath. “David won over Goliath because he was not afraid,” Capriles told reporters recently. “The Venezuelan people are not afraid.”But the argument did not sway Tailde Salazar, 45, a teacher who had been trained through a government program in the slum where she lives.“Our hope, our leftist movement is in place with this revolution,” she said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
       "7231  VenezuelaNew treatment for Chavez, official saysAiling Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez has been undergoing “tougher” new treatment for cancer, including chemotherapy, at the military hospital where he has been for the past two weeks, his vice president said.Speaking in Caracas after a Catholic Mass to pray for Chavez’s health, Nicolas Maduro described how the socialist president had personally given the order to leave Cuba in mid-February, two months after his latest cancer surgery there.“He said, ‘I’ve taken the decision to return to Venezuela. I’m going to enter a new phase of complementary treatments, tougher and more intense. I want to be in Caracas,’?” Maduro said Friday.Apart from one set of photos showing Chavez in a Havana hospital bed, he has not been seen or heard from in public since the Dec. 11 surgery in Cuba, his fourth operation since the disease was detected in mid-2011. Chavez had previous rounds of chemo- and radiotherapy, which at times left him bald and bloated. He twice wrongly declared himself cured.Furious about rumors swirling all week that Chavez may have died, Maduro said the new treatment was possible only because the president’s condition had actually improved in January.— ReutersZimbabweMugabe celebrates 89th birthdayZimbabwean President Robert Mugabe, celebrating his 89th birthday, says he believes he will defeat his opponents in elections this year and remain in power at least another five years.Mugabe cut a 40-pound cake Saturday in a sports arena in Bindura. His party’s youth groups said they walked to the bash to celebrate his “walk through a life of struggle against colonialism and Western imperialism.”Mugabe, who came to power in 1987, said he was confident his ZANU-PF party will triumph at the polls and accused his rivals of claiming there’s been a recent increase in political violence so as to blame their upcoming election defeat on unfair polls.— Associated PressUnited NationsU.N. may lift Somalia arms embargoThe U.N. Security Council is considering lifting an arms embargo on Somalia’s government for one year so it can beef up its army to combat Islamist fighters, according to a draft resolution.The Somali government has asked for the arms embargo to be lifted, and the United States has been pushing the council to agree. But Britain and France have been wary of removing the ban in a country already awash with weapons, diplomats say.The draft resolution, drawn up by Britain and obtained by Reuters, appears to propose a compromise: lifting the arms embargo for one year but keeping restrictions in place on heavy weapons such as surface-to-air missiles, howitzers and cannons. The council is expected to vote on the draft Wednesday.The 15-member council imposed the embargo in 1992 to cut the flow of arms to feuding warlords, who a year earlier ousted dictator Mohamed Siad Barre, plunging Somalia into civil war.— ReutersDeveloper ready to demolish Berlin Wall: A property developer behind plans to demolish a remnant of the Berlin Wall to make way for luxury apartments said Saturday that he would carry through with the action despite protests. “On Monday, the work continues,” Maik Uwe Hinkel told Berlin newspaper BZ. “We have the permission and think the building is good for Berlin.” On Friday, protesters at the East Side Gallery, a nearly 1-mile stretch of the Berlin Wall, prevented a crane from removing a section. The major tourist spot features some 120 paintings by international artists. Hinkel, of the Living Bauhaus investment group, said that the demolition would provide an access road to the apartments and allow for the rebuilding of a pedestrian bridge destroyed in World War II. Protesters plan to gather on Sunday at 2 p.m. at that stretch of the Wall, but observers say it’s unlikely the project can be permanently blocked.Colleagues defend hot air balloon pilot: Hot air balloon pilots in Luxor, Egypt, are defending their colleague who survived Tuesday’s crash that killed 19 tourists. Initial reports say the balloon was trying to land when a cable got caught around a gas tube and a fire erupted. Pilots who know the Egyptian pilot, Momin Murad, said in a press conference Saturday that Murad has an eight-year track record of flying balloons without incident. Murad, who suffered severe burns, and a British tourist were the only survivors. The pilots also defended Egypt’s safety measures for the tourist activity, saying the company that operated the balloon that crashed had canceled trips the day before due to bad weather.From wire reports                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",
       "7236  CARACAS, Venezuela — Hugo Chavez’s fervent followers still assemble in the capital’s main public square, decked in the bright red of their leader’s movement, to chant revolutionary songs that envisage the president leading the country far into the future.But Chavez, who has dominated public life here since the late 1990s, is nowhere to be seen. He no longer gives his trademark bombastic speeches, nor does he hold forth on television like a game-show host. On Sunday, he remained in Cuba, where he has been for nearly a month, presumably convalescing after undergoing surgery to remove what he called “some malignant cells” in his pelvic region, from which doctors have struggled to extricate a cancerous tumor.To Venezuelans, it is becoming clear that Chavez may well not return by Thursday, a key day in the political calendar. The 58-year-old former paratrooper is supposed to be inaugurated that day for a fourth term that would extend his presidency until 2019.Opposition leaders say that would leave a power vacuum that by law should shift authority to an interim leader of the leftist government and trigger fresh elections, a scenario that could end the socialist government that has transformed one of the world’s great oil powers. That is unlikely to happen, however, with the president’s top aides sending strong signals over the weekend that they were scrambling to postpone the inauguration.“I am clear that the president may not be able to take the oath in five days because of his condition, but what’s the problem?” said Javier Ramirez, 54, who works on ideological training in Chavez’s Socialist party and joined the crowds over the weekend at Bolivar Plaza. “If El Comandante cannot be here, we will be the commander. We will be Chavez.”Indeed, Vice President Nicolas Maduro, whom Chavez has said would succeed him if he is unable to return to power, and National Assembly President Diosdado Cabello have gone to great lengths to display a united front, one completely opposed to any interpretation of the constitution that would shift power away from the president.In a sense, that has helped create an air of serenity.But some here say it feels like the calm before the storm that would descend on this country of 29 million should Chavez fail to return to power, as the president himself publicly contemplated before flying to Havana on Dec. 10.“It is a crisis situation that you have an elected leader on his death bed,” said David Smilde, a University of Georgia expert on Venezuelan politics and co-editor of “Venezuela’s Bolivarian Democracy: Participation, Politics, and Culture Under Chavez.”“Chavez is very clearly near the end. You can imagine him recovering, but it appears he is on his death bed.”Since Chavez first announced he had undergone cancer surgeries in June 2011, his condition has been largely cloaked in secrecy. There have been four operations, but he has not said what kind of cancer he has, exactly where it is located or what the prognosis is.Chavez’s aides have only added to the uncertainty over the past month.A day after Chavez’s Dec. 11 operation, Information Minister Ernesto Villegas said on a government Web site that Chavez might not be back for the swearing-in. Then on Christmas Eve, Maduro, the vice president, told state television he had spoken with Chavez by phone and that he was up and walking.By New Year’s Eve, Chavez was suffering from “new complications,” Maduro said in a televised address. Then on Thursday, Villegas said Chavez had a “severe” respiratory infection.“We are always informing, with the truth,” Maduro said in a carefully choreographed interview on state television Friday.But opposition leaders said the government is probably shielding unpleasant details of Chavez’s health, leaving some Venezuelans to conclude that the president may be on life support, or worse.“Trying to make the country believe that the president is governing is absurd to the point of being irresponsible,” Ramon Guillermo Aveledo, head of the Democratic Unity coalition of Chavez opponents, said at a news conference last week.The government’s adversaries say that a commission should be sent to Cuba to determine whether Chavez is fit to remain president.They note that the constitution directs that if the president dies or is too ill to govern, then a new election must be held within 30 days.The constitution says the inauguration of a president should take place on Jan. 10 before the National Assembly. It also says that if the swearing-in cannot take place before the assembly, then it should take place before the Supreme Court.Maduro and Cabello have seized on that second clause to say that the constitution permits the inauguration to be postponed.“Get this into your heads: Hugo Chavez was elected president, and he will continue to be president beyond Jan. 10,” Cabello said Saturday, directing his words to opponents. “You should have no doubt about that.”Maria Corina Machado, an opposition member of the National Assembly, said it has become clear the inauguration is considered by the government’s ruling circle to be a mere formality.“Never in 200 years of our history has the destiny of the country been decided outside of the country,” she said. “What they want is to let January 10th pass like it’s any other day, that it is simply a formality because Chavez was reelected.”For the president’s most zealous followers, though, such criticisms amount to a concerted effort to destabilize the government.“I’m a revolutionary, and from here, my commander, I’ll be in charge,” said Jazmin Fuentes, 56, taking a break from chanting leftist songs in support of Chavez.“I love him, and from here in Bolivar Plaza I send him a revolutionary greeting, with love, to say that the people are standing with you, my commander.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",
       "7297  CARACAS, Venezuela — For more than three hours, he towered before the crowds in the city center — bombastic, fierce, funny, singing songs and promising that rigid socialism would upend the American-style capitalism he abhors.But despite the brief appearance Monday of the president of old, Hugo Chavez’s weeks of ruling via Twitter while recovering from his latest cancer surgery have left even some supporters wondering whether he will live through another six-year term.The fiery leader who survived a coup attempt a decade ago is facing a threat that could end Latin America’s most radical populist movement and remove an antagonist of the United States who has built close ties with Syria, Iran and other despotic governments. His departure could also weaken Cuba, the region’s only communist state, which is led by a gerontocracy heavily dependent on subsidized Venezuelan oil.“We see him, and we know he is sick,” said Evelyn Quevedo, a teacher who, at 57, is the same age as the president. “Something is happening to the president, because if it weren’t that way, he would be on television every day. This is not his style.”A year after Cuban doctors worked to remove a cancerous growth in a complicated surgery, a president who has run his country like a game-show host is rarely on the air and reveals only sketchy details about his condition. Chavez’s Sunday television program, “Hello, Mr. President,” has been suspended for much of the year, and so have once- ubiquitous state tours of destinations as far away as Tehran that had been a staple of the state media apparatus.In their place are smaller but intricately staged events: a brief meeting with officials from Belarus, a halting walk through the presidential palace, cameras panning Chavez head to toe to assure viewers that he is still here and moving without assistance. There are calls from El Comandante to state television programs, and his ministers have taken to reading his tweets at rallies, with the president frequently issuing 140-character missives that substitute for his usual proclamations.Chavez, though, says the swirling speculation about his health is the work of a diabolical counterrevolution intent on ousting him.“They say that I cannot walk, that I walk with two walking sticks, that I have a wheelchair,” Chavez said Monday in a packed square in central Caracas. “Soon, we’ll be playing baseball.”His jowls and body looked swollen, and he walked gingerly, but Chavez used his potent oratory skills and his cultlike status among his followers to try to erase doubts about his health.He told the sea of fervent red-shirted followers: “Here I am, once more in front of you and, in your name and the name of the fatherland, registering as candidate for president.”Such pronouncements — affirmations that the end is far from near — are consumed like gospel by his closest associates, who reveal nothing more about an illness considered a state secret. Chavez, who is the only one authorized to speak publicly about his cancer, has revealed that he has had three operations, as well as chemotherapy and radiation therapy.Asked whether Chavez could be sidelined by the recurring tumor, his campaign organizer, Jorge Rodriguez, quickly tried to dampen any hint that the president could be forced out of his race against a 39-year-old challenger, Henrique Capriles.“Absolutely not,” Rodriguez, who maintained a tense smile, said in an interview last week. “If you like, we’ll see each other on October 8 in the morning, and I’ll confirm what I’m saying now: Chavez is going to give the candidate of the right a tremendous beating.”Oncologists who have been tracking Chavez’s health — and are familiar with the kind of treatments he describes — say he may be suffering from an aggressive tumor, possibly a sarcoma, that is resistant to chemotherapy.“What that indicates to us is that the cancer has a relapse and that that cancer is very likely not a curable cancer,” said Julian Molina, an oncologist at the Mayo Clinic. “For these types of cancers, you know, the best chance is the first chance. That is when you have the best option to cure.”‘Chavez transcends life’Little by little, in a way that is increasingly felt across Venezuela, there are signs that inside Chavismo — the powerful populist movement named after Chavez — some are beginning to at least raise the possibility of a Venezuela without Chavez.In the Popular Tribune, the Communist Party’s newspaper, a recent column said Chavez’s condition “puts over the carpet — like it or not” — the possibility of his demise and how that would negatively affect Venezuela’s socialist transformation.And in a meeting of Chavez’s campaign committee in late April, Wilmar Castro, who heads the planning commission for the campaign, openly spoke of the need to consider electoral scenarios. One included a campaign without Chavez as the ruling party’s candidate.“The president has cancer,” Castro told other regional campaign chiefs. “It’s not just anything.”Loyal allies such as Ramses Reyes, a former congressman and head of a leftist movement called Venezuelan Revolutionary Currents, said it has been hard to imagine a political arena absent Chavez.“We could never fathom that this man of steel could be a human with defects, with the possibility of getting ill,” Reyes said. But Chavez’s followers, he said, now also believe that there is more to Chavez than his “physical presence,” that his philosophy would live on and keep his supporters united long after his departure.“It could be that the man is replaced, but not the Chavez philosophy,” Reyes said. “What I mean is Chavez transcends life. Chavez is the symbol of the revolutionary process.”Foreseeing a rocky transitionLately, the talk of who would replace Chavez — if failing health forces him out before October or after the election should he win — has become a central issue in Venezuelan public life. Chavez’s having been such a powerful and omnipresent leader, with moderates having left government or been forced from service, makes for the likelihood of a rocky transition.“If Chavez is not in a condition to be president, the leadership in his party is not well defined,” said Miguel Otero, editor of El Nacional, a Caracas newspaper that has aggressively explored the machinations inside Chavez’s movement. “It is not like Cuba, where Fidel has his brother. In North Korea, there is the son. Here there is no leader who can substitute for him.”Analysts here say that if illness forces Chavez out before the election, the United Socialist Party would pick another candidate. If Chavez dies in the first four years of a second term, new elections would be called.Those with political power include Adan Chavez, the president’s older brother, who introduced him to radical political thought and is close to Cuba’s leadership. There is also Vice President Elias Jaua, who cut his teeth at university protests, and Foreign Minister Nicolas Maduro, a former bus driver and union organizer.Another loyalist is Diosdado Cabello, a tough former military man who joined Chavez, then an officer in the Venezuelan army, in an ill-fated coup attempt in 1992.Marbella Pineda, 46, a die-hard Chavez follower who wore the movement’s red shirt at Monday’s rally, called those men “serious, focused and having all the support of the people.”But when asked whether any could really replace Chavez, she let out a nervous laugh and said, “Not any of them.”More world news coverage:- Clinton accuses Russia of selling attack helicopters to Syria- A Russian reformer, felled by graft- Burmese refugees in limbo- Read more headlines from around the world                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",
       "7435  Venezuela bid farewell to President Hugo Chavez in an emotional funeral on Friday and then hours later inaugurated a new president, Nicolas Maduro, who pledges to continue the late leader’s radical economic and political transformation of one of the world’s great oil powers.“I, Nicolas Maduro, militant in Chavez’s cause, assume his sash as the legitimate president, to lift the people, protect them and to follow the path of continuing the revolution,” the former vice president, 50, said after the presidential sash was placed over his shoulder upon taking the oath of office.In keeping with the day’s tone of reverence for El Comandante, Maduro cried when speaking of him and eulogized him as a Christ-like savior who had delivered Venezuela from darkness in 14 years of rule. He didn’t shy away from acknowledging the challenges he faced and stressed that he was thrust into his new role without wanting it.“This sash belongs to Hugo Chavez, our commander in chief,” Maduro said, his voice cracking before a packed congressional hall.The tributes began hours before at the funeral, as left-wing celebrities and heads of state from as far away as Iran filed into a hall in this city’s military academy to hear Chavez celebrated for having countered American influence while giving voice to the poor.“Here you are, unconquered, pure, transparent, unique, true and alive for all times,” Maduro said loudly, nearly breaking down in tears, as many in attendance gasped with grief. “Comandante, they couldn’t bring you down and they will never be able to defeat us, ever.”The government’s glorification of Chavez will extend long beyond the funeral: Chavez’s body is to be preserved and put on display for eternity in a glass coffin, a decision that delighted many of his red-shirted followers.“They will build a mausoleum so we can see him eternally,” said Jose Antonio Muñoz, 62, who was excited at the prospect of visiting the late president whenever he wanted. “That’s the first time that happens in Latin America!”Political analysts said the elaborate ceremony put on by the government and the initiative to display Chavez’s body in perpetuity would help instill in people the idea that they must follow the president’s grand designs for Venezuela, which include heavy state intervention in the economy and leading like-minded countries in opposing American foreign policy.The central beneficiary will be Maduro, whom Chavez handpicked as his successor in his last public speech, on Dec. 8. Maduro will face a presidential campaign in the weeks ahead as mandated by the constitution upon the death of the head of state.“There is an order from Chavez,” said Rafael Romero, a political scientist at the Central University of Venezuela.“Without a doubt, all these manifestations contribute,” Romero said of the deification of Chavez. “It’s a way of saying, ‘We can’t betray him, because we’re talking about continuing his legacy.’?”After being largely silent in the three days since Chavez’s death on Tuesday at age 58, the opposition on Friday rejected a controversial Supreme Court ruling made earlier in the day that declared that Maduro had become acting president when Chavez died. The ruling opens the door for Maduro to be the government’s candidate in an election because the constitution bars sitting vice presidents from running for president.“We are not going to permit that the pain that our people genuinely feel be an excuse for the abuse of power,” said Henrique Capriles, the 40-year-old governor who would likely be the opposition’s candidate.Capriles’s criticism, though, was overshadowed by the pomp that surrounded the send-off for Chavez. The funeral was staged at the same military academy where he had been a cadet decades earlier.Some Venezuelans said the ceremony was befitting of a monarch, with actors like Sean Penn arriving to mourn alongside the presidents of more than 30 countries. The dignitaries included close friends from the region, among them the presidents of Bolivia and Ecuador, and also allies from around the world, such as President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran.The United States, which Maduro earlier this week implied had taken part in a plot to infect Chavez with cancer that killed him, sent an understated delegation that included Rep. Gregory W. Meeks (D-N.Y.) and former Massachusetts congressman William Delahunt (D). The United States does not have an ambassador based in Venezuela, the last one having been ousted by Chavez during one of the frequent spats he had with Washington.Another American who was invited, the Rev. Jesse L. Jackson, led a prayer in which he called on God to help “heal the breach” between Venezuela and the Obama administration.State television provided continuous coverage, with the hosts gushing about Chavez’s legacy, saying that he not only improved the lives of Venezuelans but also forged “a multi- polar” world that challenged American supremacy.“It’s unbelievable, it’s historic — imagine being out there to hear the people say, ‘All of us are Chavez,’?” said one host. “That’s how it is. Chavez has given us a legacy — political, historic, cultural, economic.”To be sure, those who make up Chavez’s political base, many of whom are urban poor, flocked to the academy during the past three days to get in line for the chance to say goodbye to their leader.“It’s not the way you want to see him, but it was good, and I felt a good energy in that moment when I went in there,” said Kelly Garcia, 27. But she added that “he will not be replaced because no one can replace him.”Many said they would take Chavez’s words to heart — and continue to support his self-styled revolution and Maduro.“He did so much for us, and as long as we Venezuelans keep that in mind, then everything that he did hasn’t died,” said Maria Andrade, 54. “Now is the time when we need to keep in mind the values Hugo Chavez gave us.”Emilia Diaz contributed to this report.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",
       "7464  CARACAS, Venezuela — The death of President Hugo Chavez on Tuesday after a long fight against cancer led to an outpouring of grief from the poor masses as the country braced for an expected election to determine the future of the socialist system he established in the oil-rich nation.In a brief, somber announcement televised nationally, Vice President Nicolas Maduro, crying while he spoke, said he had “hard and tragic” information — that Chavez had died at 4:25 p.m. The 58-year-old leader had ruled Venezuela for 14 years, becoming a savior to millions but seen as a despot by opponents.The government did not say what caused Chavez’s death, having never revealed what kind of cancer he had been battling since it was detected in June 2011. But the president had been suffering from a severe infection and serious respiratory problems, Maduro had said in an earlier announcement Tuesday when Chavez was still believed to have been alive.News of El Comandante’s death led some of his followers to pour into the streets of Venezuela, which the populist leftist had turned into a socialist state modeled partly on the Cuban regime that he revered.“He was like my father. He had a soul that was very big, and we are very sad,” said Nancy del Nogal, 58, a worker in the state oil company, which Chavez purged of opponents. “He didn’t deserve it. We deserved it more than him. He fought for this country, and we’ll follow him and continue in this battle. Let that be clear to the world. We’ll fight for what he fought for here.”Chavez, though, also deeply divided this country of 29 million.He was able to take control of the courts, the congress and all other institutions, while forcing some of his toughest opponents into exile.He called his critics part of a “corrupt elite” that wanted to sack Venezuela, though polls showed that nearly 50 percent of voters opposed his rule. He also became Latin America’s leading anti-U.S. leader, accusing the United States of plotting incessantly to topple his government.Even on the day of his death, in a speech filled with accusations against the United States, Chavez’s closest associate, Maduro, had announced that there “is no doubt” that the country’s “historic enemies” had found a way to infect him with cancer.After his death was announced, President Obama said in a statement that “the United States reaffirms its support for the Venezuelan people and its interest in developing a constructive relationship with the Venezuelan government.”Under the constitution, Chavez’s death should trigger a presidential election to replace him within a month. Foreign Minister Elias Jaua said in a television interview Tuesday that Maduro will be the interim president until the election.Although no one spoke of a campaign as Venezuelans tried to get a grip on the news, Chavez told his followers in a Dec. 8 televised address that his successor should be Maduro, a former bus driver and union leader with close links to Cuba’s leadership. The opposing candidate, political analysts say, would probably be Henrique Capriles, 40, a governor who lost to Chavez in an Oct. 7 presidential election by more than 10 points but has energized the opposition.Many analysts say the opposition will have an uphill battle to win the presidency, with the sympathy votes playing in Maduro’s favor. The state’s heavy spending during election time, which includes handing out homes to voters, has also created believers who vote for Chavez’s self-styled revolutionary government.“Chavistas,” those who are part of the former president’s movement, said they would ensure that his followers’ government retains power.“The fight continues,” said Mari Pielo Garcia, 42, a hotel worker. “Chavez lives. Wherever they call on us, we’ll be there.”George Ciccariello-Maher, a professor at Drexel University and author of the book “We Created Chavez: A People’s History of the Venezuelan Revolution,” said that “there is no reason to believe that Maduro would lose, given both the popularity of the revolution but also the weakness of the opposition.”“And any government — right or left — will need to take seriously popular demands to continue, and even radicalize, the revolution,” Ciccariello-Maher said.A leading opposition figure said she hopes that Venezuelans will come together now to form a country free of the angry divisions that marked the past 14 years. “A chapter has closed for Venezuela,” said Maria Corina Machado, a congresswoman. “We should take profound lessons from all of this.”Venezuela had been in a state of tension for weeks after Chavez flew to Cuba on Dec. 10 for his fourth and most complicated of four cancer surgeries, which took place the following day.He was never seen publicly again, with only four photos of him issued, showing him lying in a bed in February flanked by two of his daughters. Chavez returned to Venezuela on Feb. 18, spirited into Caracas in a pre-dawn flight, out of the sight of cameras or well-wishers. He was taken to the hospital where he would spend the rest of his days.His poor state of health kept him from showing up to his Jan. 10 inauguration for a fourth term, prompting many Venezuelans to question whether the constitution was not being violated. Maduro and other ministers appeared to be running the day-to-day affairs of state, though their leader had not taken the oath of office.The absence of Chavez from Venezuela’s daily life was an astonishing shift in a country where all things political had revolved around a man who loved the limelight — a loquacious and bombastic leader known to give speeches lasting up to 10 hours. Indeed, an entire state media apparatus — with six television stations, a number of newspapers and dozens of community radio stations — was built to amplify his message.Forero reported from Charleston, W.Va.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",
       "7532  IN 13 YEARS of ruling Venezuela, Hugo Chavez has often benefited from his opposition. His first election victory reflected disgust with a complacent and corrupt political order; in his early years, the remnants of that elite played into his hands by boycotting elections while trying to oust him through non-democratic means. In the last presidential election, in 2006, Mr. Chavez faced a respectable but uncharismatic opponent with a history in the old order. He won handily, then forced challenger Manuel Rosales into exile.Six years later Mr. Chavez’s Venezuela is a wretched mess of inflation, food shortages, rampant drug trafficking and one of the world’s highest murder rates. Yet in the opposition, a promising new political generation has emerged whose leaders look a lot like their counterparts in Brazil, Chile or Mexico. They are populist but pragmatic; internationally schooled yet focused on the problems of the poor; and committed to peaceful change. With another presidential election less than nine months away, they are offering Venezuela a path toward rejoining the democratic world.More evidence that Mr. Chavez at last faces a serious domestic challenge came Tuesday, when one of the new leaders, 40-year-old Leopoldo Lopez, stepped out of an opposition competition to choose a presidential candidate in favor of 39-year-old Henrique Capriles Radonski — making the latter the overwhelming favorite in a Feb.?12 primary. Mr. Capriles, who upset one of Mr. Chavez’s closest allies in 2008 to become the governor of the key state of Miranda, styles himself as a Venezuelan version of Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, the immensely popular former Brazilian president who created a new regional model of center-left government. Both Mr. Capriles and Mr. Lopez have worked their way up in Venezuelan politics over the past decade despite constant persecution by Mr. Chavez, while never abandoning the democratic system.Polls show Mr. Capriles in a dead heat with Mr. Chavez, even though the president has benefited from a wave of public sympathy since revealing seven months ago that he had been treated in Cuba for cancer. Any doubt that the strongman is worried about his political future was erased this month when Mr. Chavez shook up his government by appointing two longtime military allies to key posts — most notably, Gen. Henry Rangel Silva as defense minister. Gen. Rangel has been designated by the U.S. Treasury as an international narcotics kingpin for his well-documented involvement in cocaine trafficking in tandem with Colombia’s FARC terrorist group. In Venezuela, he is notorious for declaring that the military would not tolerate an opposition election victory.It’s possible that Mr. Capriles will never get his chance to challenge Mr. Chavez at the ballot box. Though the president claims that he is cured of cancer, he has not revealed the details of his illness, and more than one foreign report has said that he suffers from an incurable malignancy. But no one should wish for Mr. Chavez’s untimely death. Instead, the democratic world should be hoping, and campaigning, for a free and fair presidential vote in October — and a democratic victory by Venezuela’s new opposition.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",
       "7786  CARACAS, Venezuela — Sixty-seven days after Venezuelans last saw him, President Hugo Chavez reappeared Friday when government officials televised photographs of him recuperating in Cuba with two of his daughters at his side.The images were the first evidence presented to Venezuelans that Chavez, who was last seen publicly Dec. 10 when he boarded a plane to Cuba for a fourth surgery to remove cancerous tissue, was alive and convalescing.In the photos, Chavez smiles from a hospital bed while flanked by daughters Maria Gabriela and Rosa Virginia. They are pictured looking at Thursday’s edition of Cuba’s state newspaper, Granma, the images serving as a sort of proof of life to those who doubted that El Comandante remained alive. The photos were shown on state television by Science and Technology Minister Jorge Arreaza, Chavez’s son-in-law.The photographs have come as tensions have flared in Venezuela, with opposition leaders increasingly demanding to see evidence that Chavez has been recuperating, as his aides have claimed.Although he had once held forth on television as if he were the host of a reality show, there has been nothing but silence since his December surgery. No photographs or video had been released. Chavez missed his Jan. 10 swearing in for a fourth term, following a bruising reelection campaign last year. He had also stopped posting on Twitter and making late-night phone calls to his favorite state television interviewers.Then on Friday morning, Information Minister Ernesto Villegas said that after a “complicated postoperative process, the patient is conscious, with his intellectual functions intact, in close communication with his government team.”Villegas said that a respiratory infection had been controlled but that Chavez still faced difficulties. “Under these circumstances, which are being treated, the commander is currently breathing through a tracheal tube,” he said.Doctors were “applying energetic treatment for the illness,” he said, adding that there could be complications. The government has not said what kind of cancer Chavez has, whether it is spreading or what the prognosis is.But Villegas struck a hopeful tone in his public comments, saying: “We are confident, along with the Venezuelans and the other peoples of the world, that Chavez will overcome these delicate circumstances sooner rather than later to accompany his people on the path toward new victories.”Who is in charge?The disclosure came a day after Henrique Capriles, the 40-year-old leader of Venezuela’s opposition, demanded that the government present details about the president’s health. Directing his comments at Venezuelan officials, Capriles said that if Chavez did not appear publicly “then you’re lying” about him being in charge of the day-to-day affairs of government.Indeed, some Venezuelans had begun to wonder whether the man who single-handedly ran this country for 14 years was really in charge, even as Chavez’s lieutenants contended that he had been closely involved in every key decision over the past two months.This past week, Arreaza said in public comments that Chavez had so meticulously analyzed images from Venezuela’s new satellite that he was prompted to order spot inspections of untilled land.The president had also ordered increased spending on state factories, another minister reported, and approved a devaluation of the currency that went into effect Wednesday.The wheels of government, to be sure, had still been churning in this oil-rich country.But for some people here, Venezuela has been in a sort of tropical twilight zone, with officials resolutely contending that Chavez is involved in every intricate detail of governance, even though no one outside of a small cadre of ministers and family members had access to him.“We’re living in a fantasy world,” said Aida Barreto, 56, who says that, like other Venezuelans, she’s exasperated by the political uncertainty. “I think what they are telling us are lies, really, because we’re being governed by someone we can’t see. And the only one who we obey and can’t see is God.”Meanwhile, Venezuela is being buffeted by a series of crises that seem magnified because of questions about who really is the central authority in the government.In January, a prison riot left 58 dead, while sky-high inflation is eating into Venezuelans’ earnings. Food shortages, a fact of life for years, seemed to grow worse, with a vast range of items, including chicken, cooking oil and flour, missing from many stores’ shelves. Topping it off was the devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar by 32 percent, a policy move analysts say the government was forced to make because of heavy campaign-related spending last year that nearly tripled the fiscal deficit.This week at the giant Excelsior Gama supermarket, shelves for chicken and turkey were empty; there was no toilet paper or the flour used in cornmeal cakes. The aisles carrying cleaning supplies were mostly empty.“Last week, there was a lot of toilet paper, now there isn’t any. Why?” said Galeazzo Ferrari, 63, an art gallery manager, as he guided his cart through a half-empty aisle.Johanna Hauser, 50, a former bank worker, said it has gotten to the point that when she finds a product that has been missing for weeks — say corn oil — she will call relatives or friends who quickly rush to the store to stock up.“It’s like a carnival,” she said. “It’s like an adventure. You come here, and products are missing, so you go to try to find them wherever you can.”The government had reacted to the criticism by taking a page from Chavez’s playbook — charging that companies hoard products to drive up prices and that political opponents are using Chavez’s absence to destabilize the state and plot an assassination of top administration officials.“They’ve orchestrated a macabre and criminal plot with the purpose of killing us, something they won’t be able to achieve,” Vice President Nicolas Maduro recently told supporters, claiming he was a target.He then promised “an iron fist against the conspiracy of the right,” without providing evidence of the plot or naming the conspirators.The government has also begun legal proceedings against Globovision, the only anti-Chavez television network in the country, saying that its coverage of Chavez’s health crisis is causing “anxiety” in the country.At the same time, state television networks have been playing one after another spot featuring Chavez hugging children or being lauded by older Venezuelans for his social policies.“Get better,” says an elderly woman in one ad. “We need you in the country.” The spots finish with these words: “Now, more than ever, it’s with Chavez.”Only few, vague details releasedBut the few details released about the president’s condition have been vague.And some of those who had released the details surprised Venezuelans. Earlier this week, for instance, the Cuban government issued the transcript of an interview with Fidel Castro, in which Cuba’s ex-president reported that Chavez “is recovering” although it has been “difficult and hard.”Castro’s comments, however, had been made nine days earlier, Feb. 3, and the delay in their publication was not explained.Last Saturday, Venezuela’s foreign minister, Elias Jaua, said Chavez was going through a “slow, slow recovery process.” He added that Chavez is “fighting his battle with great faith, and clinging to Christ and clinging to life.”Then on Wednesday, Maduro said Chavez was “receiving complementary treatments” that he called “extremely complex and tough treatments.” The vice president did not elaborate on what kind of treatments they were.Despite the uncertainty, there is no void of power, said Luis Vicente Leon, a pollster who runs the Caracas firm Datanalisis. He said that Chavez’s illness increased his approval ratings in December, the last month that Datanalisis had completed a political poll in the country.Leon said the personal, almost-mystical connection Chavez has with poor Venezuelan   \n",
       "7871  Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro has had quite a run of it lately.A couple of months ago, his allies in the Supreme Court tried to dissolve the country's opposition-controlled legislative branch. That prompted a swift backlash, with thousands of Venezuelans participating in regular, sustained protest efforts. Over the past few months, more than 120 people have been killed. And now, Maduro has convened a super-assembly to rewrite the constitution. Opposition leaders worry this body will effectively replace the country's legislature and allow Maduro to crack down on dissent.This naked power grab has prompted international condemnation and a threat of massive U.S. sanctions. President Trump said that Maduro has joined an “exclusive club” of dictators. How did this former bus driver and groupie become one of the most reviled leaders in the world?Maduro began his political life as president of the student union at his local high school. He never graduated, but the son of two leftists left an impression. “He would address us during the assembly to talk about students' rights and that sort of thing. He didn't speak much and wasn't agitating people into action but what he did say was usually poignant,” Grisel Rojas, a former classmate who is now the school's principal, told the Guardian.After a brief flirtation with rock music, Maduro became a bus driver in Caracas, Venezuela's capital. Along with his father, he organized a local union. He was also active in the MBR-200, the civilian wing of Hugo Chávez's military movement. He campaigned frequently for Chávez's release from prison.Once Chávez was released, Maduro joined his political operation, helping to rewrite the 1999 constitution and joining the National Assembly. When Chávez became president, he named Maduro foreign minister. In that role, he famously took on the United States, comparing Guantanamo Bay prison to the Holocaust.When Chávez was dying of cancer, he urged Venezuela to elect Maduro, a man he described as “a complete revolutionary, a man of great experience despite his youth, with great dedication and capacity for work, for leading, for handling the most difficult situations.”Maduro campaigned as Chávez's protege. On national television, he recounted how the president came to him from the grave in the form of a song bird. “All of a sudden, a little bird circled three times around me, stopped on a wooden beam, and began to sing a pretty song,” Maduro said. “Then I, too, began to whistle,” he said, whistling like a bird as he talked. “The little bird looked at me in a strange way. He sang, circled me once and flew away. And I felt his spirit. I felt him giving us a blessing, saying now the battle begins, go to victory.”Maduro ran on a socialist platform, saying that it's him or the oligarchy. He was narrowly elected in April 2013 by a margin of just 1.5 percent.Since that narrow win, Maduro has been trying to channel his predecessor. As my colleagues reported: “Maduro often dresses like Chávez, talks like Chávez and has even told Venezuelans that he has slept in Chávez’s tomb. Wednesday’s anniversary events will give him the chance to remind ‘Chavista’ loyalists that he’s the late commandante’s chosen one. “Chávez sets the route, Maduro takes the wheel,” was the campaign slogan he ran on, playing up his blue-collar bus-driver background.”He also mimicked Chávez's tough talk toward enemies, immediately expelling U.S. diplomats and accusing “historical enemies” of poisoning Chávez.Maduro, however, lacks Chávez's chavismo. “While Chavez was a very charismatic leader who was able to maintain cohesion among different groups within the government structure, Maduro doesn't have that ability, and he also doesn't have the money that Chavez had because the price of oil has plummeted,” Taraciuk Broner told NBC news. “He doesn't have the funds to sustain all the social programs that Chavez had.”Maduro has had to deal with an economic crisis that Chávez did not have to face. The country's economy, heavily dependent on petroleum production, began to falter, then entered free fall as the price of crude oil plummeted. During Maduro's four years in office, the country's economy has shrunk by 23 percent. People are starving, and the Venezuelan government cannot get the food or medicine people need. About three-quarters of the country's citizens have lost weight in the past year. And with growing levels of desperation, crime has spiked.The economic crisis has turned into protests and a political crisis that has been exacerbated by Maduro. He has cracked down on his opponents, arresting opposition leaders on “conspiracy” charges. He censored unflattering news coverage and allowed his national guardsmen to club activists in the streets, bloody scenes that are captured on television. He lacks Chávez's gift for language, instead railing against the “fascists” in the street in near nightly speeches. Even his propaganda suffers — Maduro was roundly mocked after he went on a television program and performed a song for Venezuelan unity.As a result, the country's opposition, long derided as weak and disorganized, has grown much stronger. Even members of Maduro's working-class base have begun to question the leader's fitness for office. Last year, a poll showed his approval rating in the low 20s. Time magazine called him the “world's most embattled political leader.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",
       "7962  Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez will undergo his fourth cancer surgery in Cuba in the coming days, the fiery leader said over the weekend, explaining that he had decided to designate a successor in case the illness forces him to resign from the office he has held for nearly 14 years.The announcement was the clearest sign yet that Chavez’s battle with cancer could abruptly end his self-described socialist revolution. It prompted his followers to flock to churches and public squares Sunday to pray and chant slogans supporting him.Saturday night, in a dour address on television, the president said “some malignant cells” had been detected in his pelvic region that would necessitate surgery in Havana’s Cimeq hospital, where he has been treated before. Chavez said he would fly to Cuba on Sunday, although the government did not confirm his departure.Chavez, 58, said his vice president and confidant, Nicolas Maduro, would assume control if he has to step down. The populist leader urged supporters to vote for Maduro, who made his mark as Chavez’s foreign minister, should there be a need for a presidential election.“If something happens that sidelines me, which under the constitution requires a new presidential election, you should elect Nicolas Maduro as president,” Chavez said, sitting at a table with Maduro at his side. “I ask that of you from my heart.”Moises Naim, a former Venezuelan government official who is an analyst at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington, called the announcement “basically a farewell speech.”“He said goodbye to power,” Naim said. “It’s a statement full of resignation and appeals to God. There is no plan. The only talk of the future is that there will be elections and he asks for people to vote for Maduro.”Chavez’s departure would mark the end of a tumultuous rule in which the leftist former army officer harnessed Venezuela’s considerable oil wealth to shower the poor with social programs while engineering a sharp diplomatic shift away from the country’s historical ally, the United States.Chavez’s government forged alliances with some of Washington’s most intransigent adversaries, including Cuba, Iran and Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. He has used his lock on practically all levers of power, from the courts to the congress, to push forward the nationalization of hundreds of private companies and the seizure of wide swaths of farmland.For Venezuela’s opposition, the possible scenarios that Chavez discussed in Saturday’s address amount to the first time the president has publicly acknowledged the severity of his illness and the impact it could have on the future of the country.No one in the government is authorized to discuss Chavez’s medical condition except Chavez himself, who astonished his countrymen in June 2011 by telling them he had gone under the knife twice to remove a malignant growth. A third surgery followed in February.Chavez has never disclosed what kind of cancer he has or where it is located. He has twice pronounced himself cured, without providing details.“It was time to tell the truth to the country,” said Maria Corina Machado, an opposition member of the National Assembly. “Venezuela has been living with a lot of uncertainty. In a democratic country where the constitution is obeyed, the president must talk about his health when it is compromised.”Should Chavez die or have to resign, the constitution calls for Venezuela to stage presidential elections within 30 days. Maduro, a 50-year-old former union organizer and bus driver who has risen through the ranks of Chavez’s movement, would become the candidate of the president’s United Socialist Party.The constitution also requires that the vice president fill in for the president should he be temporarily absent. Chavez has spent many weeks in Cuba in the past 18 months, undergoing chemotherapy and radiation treatments. But he has remained in charge of the government, signing decrees and bills from Havana.Machado said the opposition will call for a strict interpretation of the constitution now that Chavez has suggested the possibility of stepping aside.“Article 233 of the constitution is clear about the only mechanism, an election within 30 days,” she said. “He can’t name a successor. It’s the Venezuelan people who decide.”An election would mean a contest between Maduro and the opposition’s leader, Henrique Capriles.Capriles lost to Chavez in the presidential election held Oct. 7, with the incumbent winning 55 percent of the vote to the challenger’s 44 percent. Polls, though, have shown that Capriles is more popular in Venezuela than all of Chavez’s closest associates, including Maduro.The president’s swearing-in for another six-year term is scheduled for Jan. 10, but his announcement, following weeks in which he remained out of public view, raised questions about whether the inauguration will take place.“This is how life goes,” Chavez said in his televised address. “God willing, I hope to be able to give you good news in the coming days.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",
       "7994  Back in fall 2010, one of those absurd memes began circulating in think tanks, on the Internet and around trading desks regarding the impact of uncertainty. “Oh no!” declared pundits. “The economy cannot recover so long as it is racked with uncertainty.”Not coincidentally, the first go-round was right before the midterm elections in the United States. The “uncertainty trope” is back again, and — what a surprising coincidence! — during another election year.Indeed, Google Trends reveals that there is a pattern to the media use of the term “uncertainty.” It starts high in the beginning of the year, as media outlets trot out their year-in-preview pieces. It hits its nadir over the summer as families vacation and the latest fun and sun articles are de rigueur. It ramps up to a distinct peak in October and November, just as voters head to the polls in state, local and federal elections. In a fairly evenly divided country, there is surely uncertainty about election contests. Then it bottoms out around the holidays. While you may not know what you are getting for Christmas, Google’s not high on “uncertainty” either.Uncertainty has become a news media darling since 2008. The recession, credit crisis and market collapse drive lots of interest in the idea.It does not take much deep thought to recognize the utter nonsense of this. Anyone complaining about a lack of certainty — in policy, in the economy, in markets or even the weather — simply reveals how little they understand about all of these things.From the investor’s perspective, markets require uncertainty to function. Indeed, they thrive on doubt, imperfect information and a lack of consensus. Uncertainty drives the market’s price-discovery mechanism. Investing requires differences of opinion, for when there is broad agreement about an asset’s fair value, trading volume falls.Without uncertainty, who would take the opposite side of your trade?History teaches us that whenever the opposite occurs — when groupthink and consensus overwhelm doubt — the herd tends to be embarrassingly wrong. In those rare instances when there is a near-total lack of uncertainty in the market, the outcome usually is a spectacular disaster.Think of the false certainty surrounding the peak of the dot-com bubble (profits don’t matter!), or the nadir in March 2009 (the abyss awaits!) to validate just how true this is.Indeed, during the dot-com era, everyone knew that profits no longer mattered — it was all about eyeballs and clicks! With uncertainty banished, an epic crash followed.After that implosion, the pendulum swung to the opposite extreme. There were lots of profitable, debt-free tech companies trading for less than book value. I recall that the stock of MicroMuse, a former high-flying telecom that had traded for more than $200 at its peak, was trading at $1.43. That was less than the $2-a-share cash it had on its debt-free balance sheets and far below its $3 book value. Investors had become certain that a dollar was worth only 75 cents. (IBM eventually bought MicroMuse for more than $10 a share).The March 2009 stock-market lows were not so long ago. At the time, nearly everyone was sure the world was falling into the abyss. There was little uncertainty then, causing massive and indiscriminate selling. I wonder whether those certain panicked sellers are happy they followed the consensus on dumping equities ahead of a 109-percent rally.Caroline Baum, the savvy longtime economics observer and Bloomberg columnist, notes: “The future is always uncertain. It was uncertain in 1999, yet investors were buying stocks of Internet companies that had no revenue, no profits and no real business plan. It was uncertain during the condo-flipping frenzy in 2005, as well. And no one mistook irrational exuberance for uncertainty.”Since then, the uncertainty trope has become the general catch-all for explaining (or mis-explaining) a variety of future events. The list of uncertainties is long: The fiscal cliff, U.S. tax policy, health-care laws, what happens in Greece, will we have a recession next year or not, is housing recovering, what happens to the euro zone, will the euro currency collapse, what about the U.S. elections?I recall no one saying that investing was difficult due to the uncertainty caused by a potential nuclear conflagration between the United States and the Soviet Union during the Cold War. The sword of Damocles hung over everyone’s head. Is the Greek situation today more dire or uncertain than the policy of mutually assured destruction ever was?Regardless, all of these unknown events will be resolved one way or another at some point in the future. Which is, of course, how all ambiguities eventually get resolved — at some future unknown date. That is why the uncertainty claim is so absurdist. The lack of understanding today of an unknowable future always gets revealed as the future becomes known to us.This is how things unfold in a linear timeline.It finally dawned on me what the uncertainty trope is all about. It took a conversation with a nervous chief executive to reveal it, but I teased out the answer.Most of the time, people exist in a happy little bubble of self-created delusion. We engage in selective perception, seeing only the things that agree with us. Our selective retention retains the good stuff and disregards most of the rest. In our minds, we are all younger, better-looking, slimmer, with more hair than the camera reveals.In short, we construct a reality that bears only passing resemblance to the objective universe.During those brief instances when the facade fades, the curtain gets pulled back and the ugly reality becomes clear. We get a glimmer of understanding about our own lack of understanding. That’s when the grim reality of the human condition is revealed — and it terrifies us.The next time you hear someone mention uncertainty, ask yourself this: How much less do they actually know about the future today vs. what they knew last week or year?

       "8029  Weakened from battling cancer and visibly bloated, President Hugo Chavez is fighting for his political life in Sunday’s presidential election, as he faces a charismatic challenger who has energized a once-disunited opposition in a way none of the populist leader’s foes ever has.At stake is the president’s experiment to remake Venezuela, a 14-year transformation characterized by the expropriation of private companies, diplomatic initiatives to counter U.S. influence and a near-mystical bond with the country’s poor masses.Two established pollsters show Chavez, 58, with a substantial advantage, underscoring the loyalty of millions he has commanded since sweeping into power in 1998. But two others have Chavez and Henrique Capriles, 40, a lawyer and former governor who has never lost an election, in a virtual dead heat.“This is seriously competitive,” said Cynthia Arnson, director of the Americas program at the Woodrow Wilson Center in Washington. “I would say it’s the first time since Chavez was elected that the accumulated learning experience of the opposition and the accumulated problems of the country have brought the race to a place where it’s almost too close to call.”The election is almost certainly being watched closely by Iran, which has found an ally in Venezuela, and myriad small countries in Latin America that have received aid in return for opposing Washington.The outcome is also expected to be tracked by energy markets. Venezuela recently surpassed Saudi Arabia as the country with the biggest certified oil reserves, and Chavez is considered a price hawk within the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, or OPEC, an organization Venezuela helped found.Capriles campaign officials said they believe that the large number of undecided voters identified in some polls will back the challenger at the ballot box, leading to Chavez’s defeat. That bold prediction is buttressed by the opposition’s revival after years of uninspired campaigning and the disenchantment many Venezuelans express to pollsters about decaying infrastructure, rampant violent crime and shoddy services.But the president’s advantage is undeniable. State media have delivered fawning campaign coverage while the Chavez administration has doled out refrigerators, new apartments and other gifts to prospective voters.“He has given love and made it easy for the people, the only president we have had who has had anything to do with the poor,” said Soleña Arcila, a nurse who came out Thursday for Chavez’s last pre-election speech. “Chavez will be here forever.”Still, there are signs that things are not as rosy for the president as they have been in the past. Political analysts say Chavez’s campaign has been lackluster, and nagging questions remain about his health, which is a state secret.That has many Venezuelans wondering whether the dashing former army paratrooper who stormed to prominence a generation ago as the leader of a failed coup has mustered the emotional appeal needed to get millions of voters to once more cast ballots for him.Although the president still gives a resounding speech, the Chavez of this campaign has resorted to issuing the kinds of pleas expected from a candidate coming from behind.“This government will be much better than all the governments of Chavez,” the president, who often speaks about himself in the third person, said in a recent speech. “I promise I will be a much better president than I have been.”‘The country needs a change’The Venezuela the two men are battling for is a country awash in historic oil earnings, but one that has the feel of having missed out on the democratic awakening and economic boom that is modernizing much of Latin America.Bridges and highways are decrepit, patients are forced to bring their own medicine to public hospitals, vast state projects are unfinished, rolling blackouts affect much of the country and prison riots kill hundreds each year.Polls show that voters are most concerned about a sharp rise in homicides, with 19,336 people killed last year, up from 4,550 in 1998 when Chavez was first elected president, according to the Venezuelan Violence Observatory, a group that tracks crime.“How could they fail to read what the people were thinking after 14 years?” Capriles asked in a recent speech. “The people are tired of that.”Chavez’s rhetorical flourishes against the United States and his warnings about the bourgeoisie may still electrify radicals. But they fall short for ordinary people whipsawed by problems, said Carlos Romero, a political scientist and co-author of the recent book “U.S.-Venezuela Relations Since the 1990s.”“Most of the people in Venezuela are tired of Chavez’s political speeches, the speeches that are very radical, that try to divide Venezuelans and don’t take into account the most important problems that Venezuelans are facing every day,” Romero said.Standing at the doorway of her home in the Petare hillside slum as the sun went down on a recent day, Maria Uribe, a public school teacher, said she has seen few improvements in the classrooms and worries about her son, Luis Martinez, 9, because of the violence in their neighborhood.“The truth is that the country needs a change,” she said. “This country is completely deteriorated, forgotten, in need of maintenance and of leaders who will truly concern themselves with the country.”As she spoke, others emerged from cinder-block homes to say that they, too, felt new leadership was needed.Joel Hernandez, 26, recounted how gunmen stole his motorcycle on a recent afternoon. Barbara Rodriguez, 32, who benefits from a government job providing maintenance in a community center, said the economy provides her with no other job possibilities.“The candidate Chavez has 14 years at this and hasn’t been able to handle it,” said Eder Granados, 44, who owns a small Internet cafe, ticking off problems in the country. “It’s time to give someone else the chance to see what they can do.”Many here say the president’s campaign manifesto, which is partly focused on countering “savage capitalism” and guaranteeing “planetary peace,” is out of touch with people who have to contend with one of the world’s highest inflation rates.‘The candidate of happiness’Chavez has heaped endless insults on Capriles, calling him a chameleon who would usher in a right-wing government, controlled by Washington and intent on ending popular social programs. Capriles styles himself as a center-left candidate, much like Brazil’s former president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, and says he will make state-sponsored aid more efficient.“Who’s the candidate of the Yankees, of the bourgeoisie, of big business, of the super-rich?” Chavez would ask throngs of supporters in speech after speech, with his followers shouting back a favorite put-down of Capriles.“Who’s the candidate of happiness? Of the future, of the young people, of the fatherland?” he would continue, to shouts of his name. “That is why Chavez wins on October 7.”For many, of course, that message still resonates.Loyalists such as Ismar Mota, 54, who works in a state agency and campaigns for Chavez, said he wants to extend Chavez’s political life.“There’s more to be done to consolidate socialism,” Mota said. “And though it has been 14 years, the president has the will and the desire to make Venezuela a great country, a power, a dignified country.”More world news coverage:- Food prices, inflation rise sharply in Iran- Pakistani politician plans drone attacks protest- Tensions persist between Turkey, Syria- Read more headlines from around the world                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",
       "8096  CARACAS, Venezuela —Henrique Capriles, a young governor who ran a spirited but unsuccessful effort to unseat President Hugo Chavez in an October election, said Sunday that he will run against the late president’s handpicked successor in a snap vote that will determine the future of the late leader’s self-styled socialist revolution.Capriles, 40, said he will accept the nomination of a coalition of opposition groups to face off on April 14 against Nicolas Maduro, who served Chavez as vice president until Chavez died Tuesday after a long ordeal with cancer. On Friday, Maduro, 50, was inaugurated president and vowed to continue Chavez’s radical agenda to remake this OPEC nation as a show of “the most absolute loyalty to the commander, Hugo Chavez.”Polls show Maduro would win an election against Capriles. The outpouring of emotion for the late president, who is glorified in 24-hour coverage on state television as a mythical visionary who transformed Venezuela for the betterment of its poor masses, is expected to be transferred to Maduro.But Capriles said he will not back down, even though he had been casually told by someone earlier in the day that he was being “led to a slaughterhouse.”“I want to tell our people — from here inside, clinging to God, in whom I believe — that I am going to fight,” Capriles said, in a pointed address in which he accused the government of using Chavez’s death to campaign.“Nicolas,” Capriles said, speaking directly to Maduro, “I am not going to leave you an open road, friend. You will have to defeat me with votes. I am going to fight with these hands. I’ll fight for each vote.”Capriles said the government had known that Chavez was dying and had been laying the groundwork for decisions by the Supreme Court and the electoral board that permitted Maduro to run after the populist leader’s death.“They’ve been lying to the Venezuelans,” Capriles said. “All this was coldly calculated, when they would hold elections, the chronogram for the whole electoral process.”He added: “Who knows when President Chavez died? You had everything fixed.”Maduro, in a live speech, called Capriles’s accusations “a declaration of war.”“What’s been said is grave, very grave,” he said. “It’s the worst that we could have expected.”Chavez’s cancer was a state secret, and the public was never told what kind of tumor he had.Maduro, in his inaugural address, spoke about Chavez’s ordeal and revealed that the president believed as early as June 2011 that the tumor was severe.“He told us, ‘This is worse than what you think or what the doctors say,’ ” Maduro said, recounting discussions in Cuba, where Chavez was treated.Chavez, however, would later announce publicly that he had been cured on two occasions.Maduro also said in his speech that in December, Chavez’s “intuition” was that he was not going to emerge from the operation that awaited him in Havana. Indeed, Chavez never recovered from the Dec. 11 surgery. Still, Maduro and other officials often spoke hopefully about the president’s health in the weeks that followed, even saying he was running the day-to-day affairs of state.Capriles also said the government violated the constitution because the head of congress should have been designated interim leader upon Chavez’s death. The elevation of Maduro to acting president, Capriles said, allowed the government to get around an article in the constitution that bars sitting vice presidents from running for the presidency.It is easy to see why Capriles would not want to face Maduro.For many Venezuelans, El Comandante’s last directive is ingrained: On Dec. 8, Chavez told his countrymen in his final public comments that they should throw their support behind Maduro if Chavez became unable to govern.“I ask you that from my heart,” he said in what turned out to be his farewell to the nation.“He will be our president because our commander gave the order to put him there in power,” said Gregorio Villamizar, 38, who said he worshiped Chavez and would follow any of his orders. “He was a Chavez ally, the successor to Chavez, and he was the only one Chavez prepared to take power.”Luis Vicente Leon, director of a Caracas-based polling company whose surveys show Maduro with more support than Capriles, has said that because the election is coming so soon after Chavez’s death, many will see it as a contest between Capriles and Chavez.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
       "8113  Fidel Castro, who led a Cuban revolution that made his Caribbean island a potent symbol of the 20th-century ideological and economic divisions, and whose embrace of communism and the former Soviet Union put the world at the risk of nuclear war, died Nov. 25. He was 90.His death was announced on Cuban state TV by his younger brother, Raúl Castro, who succeeded Fidel 10 years ago as the country’s leader. The cause of death was not immediately disclosed, but Mr. Castro had been in failing health for several years.The son of a prosperous sugar planter, Mr. Castro took power in Cuba on New Year’s Day 1959, promising to share his nation’s wealth with its poorest citizens, who had suffered under the corrupt quarter-century dictatorship of Fulgencio Batista.Mr. Castro, a romantic figure in olive-drab fatigues and combat boots, chomping monstrous cigars through a bushy black beard, became a spiritual beacon for the world’s political far left.To his legion of followers, Mr. Castro was a hero who demanded a fair deal for the world’s poor and wasn’t afraid to point his pistol at the powerful to get it. His admirers said he educated, fed and provided health care to his own people, as well as to the poor in other countries, more fairly and generously than the world’s wealthy nations, most notably what he called the “Colossus to the north.”He remained one of world’s longest-serving heads of state, controlling his island nation 90 miles from U.S. shores for nearly five decades. In his homeland, Mr. Castro was as loathed as he was beloved. He was among the world’s most repressive leaders, a self-appointed president-for-life who banned free speech, freedom of assembly and a free press, and who executed or jailed thousands of political opponents.He abolished Christmas as an official holiday for nearly 30 years. While he dispatched Cuban-educated doctors and Cuban-developed vaccines to the poorest corners of Latin America, Cubans in central Havana found pharmacy shelves empty of medicine, and many lived in apartments in which they used buckets in their kitchens as toilets.With almost theatrical relish, Mr. Castro taunted 10 successive U.S. presidents, who viewed the Cuban leader variously as a potential courier of Armageddon, a blowhard nuisance, a dangerous dictator, a fomenter of revolution around Latin America, a serial human rights abuser or an irrelevant sideshow who somehow hung on after the collapse of communism almost everywhere else.Mr. Castro’s long reign began to unravel on July 31, 2006, when he temporarily transferred power to his 75-year-old brother, Raúl, after undergoing what he described as intestinal surgery. (The precise nature of Mr. Castro’s health problems was an official state secret.) The transfer of power came weeks before Mr. Castro’s 80th birthday on Aug. 13, and Mr. Castro was not seen in public again for nearly four years.He formally resigned on Feb. 19, 2008, in a statement read on national television by a spokesman, ending his 49-year reign and giving George W. Bush the distinction of being the first U.S. president to outlast Mr. Castro in power.The National Assembly officially — and unanimously — named Raúl Castro, the longtime head of the Cuban armed forces, as the country’s new president. The move was seen as deeply anticlimactic, because Mr. Castro had stage-managed the shift to his brother for the better part of two years.Beginning in the 1960s, the United States maintained a strict trade and diplomatic embargo against Cuba, hoping to drive Mr. Castro from power. In 2014, President Obama — the first U.S. president elected in the post-Fidel era — announced plans to restore full diplomatic relations with Havana. During a visit to Cuba in March 2016, Obama met Raúl Castro but made no effort to meet his brother. Fidel Castro later delivered a speech, dismissing Obama’s overtures and denouncing the idea of cooperation with the United States.Tweaking the “imperialists” was always a passion of Mr. Castro’s. He built an enormous public demonstration space — complete with stage lighting and sound — outside the U.S. diplomatic mission on the Malecon, Havana’s main seaside boulevard. There, he regularly led anti-American rallies and delivered the lengthy speeches for which he was famous.He was a particular thorn to President John F. Kennedy, who approved the clumsy Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba in April 1961 by a ragtag group of CIA-trained fighters, which became a humiliating low point of Kennedy’s presidency.To Mr. Castro’s benefactors in the Kremlin during the height of the Cold War, he was the useful commander of a communist citadel on the doorstep of the United States. That point was drawn in terrifyingly stark terms during the Cuban missile crisis of 1962, when Mr. Castro allowed the Soviets to base on his soil missiles that could carry nuclear warheads to Washington or New York in minutes. The resulting showdown between Kennedy and Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev was the closest the world has come to nuclear war.Unlike many other communist leaders around the world, Mr. Castro did not create monuments to himself or lend his name to streets and buildings. Instead, he erected billboards carrying patriotic slogans of the revolution, such as “We will overcome!,” “Toward victory, always!” and “Motherland or death!”Under his reign, Havana eventually became something of a Marxist Disneyland — a shiny, happy veneer over something much uglier.Mr. Castro personally ordered the restoration of Old Havana, an architectural gem where tourists can savor $300 boxes of Cuban cigars, some of the world’s best music and sweet Havana Club rum — the proceeds of which went to Mr. Castro’s revolution. But just a block behind the restored facades, impoverished Cubans lived in crumbling homes on rationed food. Teenage prostitutes openly offered their services to tourists.In his later years, Mr. Castro enjoyed a resurgence in popularity across much of Latin America, fueled in part by the election of several leaders inspired by his staunch anti-Americanism.In particular, President Hugo Chávez of Venezuela viewed Mr. Castro as a political beacon and father figure to the Latin American left. Sweetheart oil deals from Chávez, until his death in March 2013, were crucial to Cuba’s ability to survive as its state-dominated economy sputtered.While many Cubans expressed genuine and deep loyalty to Fidel — he was never called “Castro” in his homeland — others clearly feared a leader who imprisoned tens of thousands of his enemies over the years, often on little more than a whim.As he aged, Mr. Castro acted more like a man intent on purifying his legacy, returning his revolution to its ideological core, reversing economic openings and stepping up attacks on political dissent. He imprisoned Cubans whose crimes were as simple as passing out books on democracy.Many Cubans would not offer criticism of their leader for fear of being overheard by government informants, who lived on practically every block. To indicate Mr. Castro, they would tug on an imaginary beard. Other residents accepted him as a simple fact of life, like the tropical humidity — what good would it do to complain?The most pointed condemnations came from Cubans who fled Mr. Castro’s rule by the thousands every year. Those with enough money paid for speedboat trips across the Straits of Florida, while the poorest attempted the dangerous trip in rickety boats. Some would-be émigrés refitted Cuba’s aging American-made cars and trucks, transforming them into unlikely boats.After Raúl Castro assumed power, he embarked on a plan of economic liberalization that has been more symbolic than substantial. Private enterprise is permitted in a few small segments, such as food service and repair shops, but the military-led government still controls as much as 80 percent of the economy.Mr. Castro slowed noticeably in his final years. He had long ago given up cigars and rum, and his beard faded from thick and black to scraggly    \n",
       "8152  CARACAS, Venezuela — His loss in Sunday’s presidential election was resounding, but in conceding defeat before tearful followers, Henrique Capriles hinted at an active political future that may yet pose a challenge to President Hugo Chavez’s self-proclaimed socialist revolution.“There are more than 6 million people who are looking for a better future, and I want to tell those more than 6 million Venezuelans to count on me,” Capriles said late Sunday, in reference to the votes he received. “I am at your service.”Capriles’s supporters were crestfallen after Chavez garnered about 55 percent of the vote to about 44 percent for an opposition determined to end 14 years of populist rule in one of the world’s biggest oil exporters. Capriles conceded in a subdued, emotional address, while throngs of red-shirted “Chavistas” rejoiced as El Comandante gave yet another rousing victory speech from the presidential palace’s “people’s balcony.”Capriles did not provide details, but the managers of his campaign on Monday said the opposition would actively engage the government in December’s elections for governorships.And there are lingering doubts about Chavez’s health, although he has declared himself free of cancer. The president, 58, has said he has undergone three operations since June 2011 to remove a tumor, raising questions about whether he will be able to complete the six-year term that begins next year.If he were to die in the first four years of that term, Venezuela would have to call new elections — potentially giving Capriles another chance.“Capriles would have strong possibilities to be elected in that case,” said Margarita Lopez Maya, a Caracas analyst and writer who had once supported the president. “There is not a charismatic leader who could replace Chavez within Chavismo.”Lopez Maya believes that it would be “a grave error for Capriles to think that this was a defeat.”She said the unification of disparate Chavez foes, some of them from the right and others disaffected leftists who believe the president is an autocrat, has matured and prepared the opposition for future political battles. “It’s a strengthening that has been very significant,” she said.Lopez Maya and other analysts see positive signs for the opposition in comparing Sunday’s vote with past elections.The 6.4 million votes Capriles received represented 2.1 million more than went for opposition candidate Manuel Rosales in the 2006 presidential contest. Chavez won that election by 26 percentage points, demolishing Rosales’s political career.This time, the margin was far closer. Chavez also increased his vote count compared with 2006, by about 700,000 ballots. But the number of people who voted Sunday was 3 million higher than in 2006, when fewer than 12 million went to the polls.“What’s changed since those years is not Chavez but the opposition,” said Luis Vicente Leon, whose Caracas polling company, Datanalisis, correctly predicted Sunday’s margin of victory for Chavez.Unlike all the other candidates who have run against Chavez since 1998, Capriles solidified his position as the leader of the opposition by running a focused, well-organized campaign in which he visited most of Venezuela’s towns and cities and generated the kind of support the opposition had never seen before, Leon said.“Capriles generated emotion that you saw in the streets, that you saw in the rallies,” Leon said. “That didn’t lead to a win, but it’s something to capitalize on for the future.”For the government, the win means Chavez will deepen what he has called 21st-century socialism — a mix of state interventions in the economy, including expropriations of private companies, and an activist foreign policy that seeks to use alliances with countries such as Cuba and Iran to counter U.S. objectives.At a news conference Monday afternoon, Diosdado Cabello, who fought alongside Chavez in a failed 1992 army rebellion and is now president of the National Assembly, noted that Chavez had bettered Capriles by more than 1.5 million votes.“That’s not just anything,” he said. “We are very happy that the revolution is going to continue for another six years.”In a polarized country in which the government and its opponents represent two completely different economic and social models, disagreements over Chavez’s plans are likely to lead to pitched political battles.Indeed, Capriles stressed that the president needed to take into account that Sunday’s vote showed that a sizable percentage of Venezuelans remain opposed to his model.“I would expect that a project that’s 14 years old understands that almost half of the country is not in agreement with the option that today has remained in power,” Capriles said. “From those in power, I ask for respect, consideration and recognition of nearly half of the country.”

       "8164  LOMA LA LATA, Argentina — In a desertlike stretch of scrub grass and red buttes, oil companies are punching holes in the ground in search of what might be one of the biggest recent discoveries in the Americas: enough gas and oil to make a country known for beef and the tango an important energy player.The environment is challenging, with resources trapped deep in shale rock. But technological breakthroughs coupled with a feverish quest for the next major find are unlocking the door to oil and natural gas riches here and in several other countries in the Americas not traditionally known as energy producers.That is quickly changing the dynamics of energy geopolitics in a way that had been unforeseen just a few years ago.From Canada to Colombia to Brazil, oil and gas production in the Western Hemisphere is booming, with the United States emerging less dependent on supplies from an unstable Middle East. Central to the new energy equation is the United States itself, which has ramped up production and is now churning out 1.7 million more barrels of oil and liquid fuel per day than in 2005.“There are new players and drivers in the world,” said Ruben Etcheverry, chief executive of Gas and Oil of Neuquen, a state-owned energy firm that is positioning itself to develop oil and gas fields here in Patagonia. “There is a new geopolitical shift, and those countries that never provided oil and gas can now do so. For the United States, there is a glimmer of the possibility of self-sufficiency.”Oil produced in Persian Gulf countries — notably Saudi Arabia, Iran, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait and Iraq — will remain vital to the world’s energy picture. But what was once a seemingly unalterable truth — that American oil production would steadily fall while the United States remained heavily reliant on Middle Eastern supplies — is being turned on its head.Since 2006, exports to the United States have fallen from all but one major member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, the net decline adding up to nearly 1.8 million barrels a day. Canada, Brazil and Colombia have increased exports to the United States by 700,000 barrels daily in that time and now provide nearly 3.4 million barrels a day.Six Persian Gulf suppliers provide just 22 percent of all U.S. imports, the nonpartisan U.S. Energy Information Administration said this month. The United States’ neighbors in the Western Hemisphere, meanwhile, provide more than half — a figure that has held steady for years because, as production has fallen in the oil powers of Venezuela and Mexico, it has gone up elsewhere.Production has risen strikingly fast in places such as the tar sands of Alberta, Canada, and the “tight” rock formations of North Dakota and Texas — basins with resources so hard to refine or reach that they were not considered economically viable until recently. Oil is gushing in once-dangerous regions of Colombia and far off the coast of Brazil, under thick salt beds thousands of feet below the surface.A host of new discoveries or rosy prospects for large deposits also has energy companies drilling in the Chukchi Sea inside the Arctic Circle, deep in the Amazon, along a potentially huge field off South America’s northeast shoulder, and in the roiling waters around the Falkland Islands.“A range of big possibilities for oil are opening up,” said Juan Carlos Montiel, as he directed a team from the state-controlled company YPF to drill while a whipping wind brought an autumn chill to the potentially lucrative fields here outside Añelo. “With the exploration that is being carried out, I think we will really increase the production of gas and oil.”Because oil is a widely traded commodity, analysts say the upsurge in production in the Americas does not mean the United States will be immune to price shocks. If Iran were to close off the Strait of Hormuz, stopping tanker traffic from Middle East suppliers, a price shock wave would be felt worldwide.But the new dynamics for the United States — an increasingly intertwined energy relationship with Canada and more reliance on Brazil — mean U.S. energy supplies are more assured than before, even if oil from an important Persian Gulf supplier is temporarily halted.The fracking ‘revolution’Perhaps the biggest development in the worldwide realignment is how the United States went from importing 60 percent of its liquid fuels in 2005 to 45 percent last year. The economic downturn in the United States, improvements in automobile efficiency and an increasing reliance on biofuels all played a role.But a major driver has been the use of hydraulic fracturing. By blasting water, chemicals and tiny artificial beads at high pressure into tight rock formations to make them porous, workers have increased oil production in North Dakota from a few thousand barrels a day a decade ago to nearly half a million barrels today.Conservative estimates are that oil and natural gas produced through “fracking,” as the process is better known, could amount to 3 million barrels a day by 2020.“We have a revolution here,” said Larry Goldstein, director of the Energy Policy Research Foundation in New York. “In 47 years in this business, I’ve never seen anything like this. This is the equivalent of a Category 5 hurricane.”All of this has happened as exports from Mexico and Venezuela have fallen in recent years, a trend analysts attribute to mismanagement and lack of investment at the state-owned oil industries in those countries. Even so, there is a possibility that new governments in Mexico and Venezuela — Mexico elects a new president July 1, and Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez has cancer — could open the energy industry to the private investment and expertise needed to boost production, analysts say.“There’s a lot of upside potential in Latin America that will boost the oil supply over the medium term,” said RoseAnne Franco, who analyzes exploration and production prospects in the region for the energy consultant Wood Mackenzie. “So it’s very positive.”Political elementsMuch of the exploration, though, will not be easy, cheap or, as in Argentina’s case, free of political pitfalls. Price controls on natural gas and import restrictions have made doing business in Argentina hard for energy companies. And last month, President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner’s populist government stunned oil markets by expropriating YPF, the biggest energy company here, from Spain’s Repsol.But the prize for energy companies is potentially huge. Repsol estimated this year that a cross section of the vast Dead Cow formation here in Neuquen province could hold nearly 23 billion barrels of gas and oil. That followed a U.S. Energy Information Administration report that said Argentina possibly has the third-largest shale gas resources after China and the United States.“All the top-of-the-line companies are here,” said Guillermo Coco, energy minister of Neuquen province, including ExxonMobil, Chevron and Royal Dutch Shell. Although only about 200 wells have been drilled, Coco said companies here talk of drilling 10,000 or more in the next 15 years.Wells on the horizonOn a recent day here in a dusty spot called Loma La Lata, German Perez oversaw a team of 30 technicians from the Houston-based oil- services giant Schlumberger as they prepared to frack a well.The operation was huge: Trucks lined up with revving generators. Giant containers brimmed with water. Hoses used for firing chemicals into wells littered the ground. Cranes hoisted huge bags of artificial sand into mixers. Then, 1,200-horsepower pumps blasted water, chemicals and sand nearly 9,000 feet into the earth. “This is a hard rock, so we create countless cracks and fissures, for the gas and oil to flow,” Perez said.Staring at the stark landscape, broken up here and there by oil rigs, Perez said he thought many companies would one day arrive in search of oil and gas. “The projections are pretty good,” he said. “In our case, we have been here a ye   \n",
       "8171  BOGOTA, Colombia — Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez will undergo cancer surgery in Cuba for the third time in eight months as early as Monday, an indication that he may be facing an aggressive tumor that could spread throughout his body, oncologists and gastroenterologists say.In a country where Chavez makes all major decisions and pronouncements, details about his illness remain sketchy, with only the maximum leader revealing what he sees fit to disclose. But leading doctors who treat various forms of cancer, including those in the pelvic area where Chavez has been stricken, say the recent discovery of a one-inch formation points to a new, potentially critical stage for the president.“He is facing a delicate situation, one of great uncertainty and everything points to an aggressive tumor,” said Carlos Castro, a Colombian oncologist and scientific director of the Colombian League Against Cancer. “I wouldn’t be surprised if in a few months we hear about a small lesion elsewhere in his body, in a lung, or in the liver. That’s called metastasis.”Like Castro, Floriano Marchetti, a University of Miami professor who treats colon and rectal cancer, does not have direct knowledge of Chavez’s health. But Marchetti, too, has followed the president’s pronouncements about his fight with cancer, including the announcement last week that Cuban doctors would operate once more to remove what could be a malignant growth.“The guy had surgery, he had chemotherapy and less than a year later he is having the same problem in the same area,” Marchetti said, speaking by phone during a break in an operation he was conducting in Miami. “That obviously is a bad prognosticating indicator.”Facing reelection fightChavez, a 57-year-old leftist firebrand who has formed alliances with pariah nations ranging from Syria to Iran to Cuba, has been a political provocateur since he led a failed coup in 1992. But since June, questions about his health have dominated political discussions in oil-rich Venezuela.That was when Chavez announced on national television that he had undergone two operations in Cuba that removed a baseball-size tumor. He never publicly disclosed what kind of cancer he had, nor the site of the original tumor.The president later revealed that he had four chemotherapy sessions. He then pronounced himself cured of cancer and resumed a hard-driving campaign to secure victory in October’s presidential election, in which he faces a 39-year-old challenger, Henrique Capriles.But then Tuesday, Chavez said Cuban doctors had detected “a lesion” with a high probability of being cancerous in the same spot where the first tumor had been removed.On Thursday, his last full day in Venezuela before flying to Cuba, Chavez hosted an event for his staunch followers at a Caracas theater in which he described how Jesus Christ had come to him in a dream. “He told me, ‘Chavez, get up, it is not time to die, it is time to live,’ ” Chavez said.Chavez also sounded contemplative, saying he was “preparing for the worst.” Speaking of the lesion, he said that “the possibility that it is malignant is greater than it not being” malignant.Doctors consulted in Colombia, Venezuela and the United States say Chavez probably has a tumor and that it may have metastasized. The fact that a new growth appeared so soon after his chemotherapy was seen as a sign that it is a stubborn tumor.“It is a new growth from probably the same tumor that was treated before,” said Leon Lapco, a Miami-based kidney specialist who is president of the Venezuelan-American Medical Association. He said that there is “an extremely high possibility” that other cancerous cells “are already in there, at least some cells, some malignant cells.”The spread of the cancerous cell would depend on the type of tumor and the location, said Pedro Jose Greer Jr., a liver and digestive disease specialist in Miami.“Some tumors spread by lymph node,” said Greer, who is also a professor at Florida International University’s medical school. “Those that spread by blood will end up in the liver and in the lungs. And some spread locally,” meaning they invade tissues adjacent to the tumor.‘I will return’Judging from what Chavez has said about his illness, his tumor could be in the bladder, the rectum or the colon, said Marchetti, the Miami doctor who treats rectal and colon cancer.“Particularly, for colo-rectal cancers, 80 percent of the tumor recurs within the first two years after treatment,” Marchetti said. “The bottom line is that whatever it is, it’s a problem because now it’s back.”Marchetti said the operation Chavez faces in Cuba, along with radiation therapy or chemotherapy, will be challenging for his medical team. “The cancer stepped up the fight, and now you have to come up with better forms of treating it,” Marchetti said. “Otherwise there will be no hope.”Chavez, though, is planning to govern from Cuba while planning his return to Venezuela to resume campaigning for a new six-year term to extend his presidency until 2019. “I will return as I always return — with more energy, more enthusiasm and more happiness,” Chavez wrote in a letter to the National Assembly last week.Specialists such as Douglas Leon Natera, a surgeon and urologist in Caracas who is president of the Venezuelan Medical Federation, said the president’s condition calls for him to set aside governing for now. “He wants to transmit a show of strength to all of Venezuela’s people, followers or not, so they believe that he is full of vigor and can continue governing,” Natera said. “You are left with the impression that what predominates is politics over his own health.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",
       "8255  CARACAS, Venezuela – As President Hugo Chavez battles a cancer that has sidelined him for much of the past year, a group of loyal associates has stepped into the spotlight, sparking speculation across a polarized political landscape over who could replace the fiery leader should his condition force him from office.With Chavez running for reelection in October, public talk of relinquishing power is unthinkable in his inner sanctum, where the mantra is “with Chavez everything, without Chavez nothing.” But the uncertainty created by his condition is trumping his efforts to tamp down talk of succession, say those who have had conversations with people in the upper echelon of the populist government.“There are two things they talk about: how the opposition is doing and whether it is growing, and they talk about how sick the chief is and who would replace him,” said Eduardo Semtei, a former government official who had befriended Chavez’s elder brother, Adan, and worked closely with other top officials.Chavez, a messiah-like leader who has amassed broad powers in 13 years of rule, has tried to dispel rumors that his condition would stop him from campaigning, let alone ruling this oil-rich country. This week, he dominated the airwaves, giving three long, rambling speeches spiced with warnings about Western imperialism and American-style capitalism. The appearances began Monday, when he sang folk songs and gave a thunderous speech after registering for his fourth presidential campaign since 1998.He told the crowd that while the opposition was engaged in a “psychological war” by raising questions about his purported successor, his ministers have been focused on ensuring that the government is running smoothly.“They have deployed and demonstrated that there is a collective government here, an efficient government, a government of the people and for the people,” he said.Chavez’s inner circleThe president’s assertions of normalcy aside, Venezuelans have been engrossed in the drama playing out in government circles behind closed doors – discussions over what direction Chavez’s so-called revolution would take should failing health force the maximum leader to cede power and anoint a successor.A handful of the president’s closest aides – as well as his brother Adan and one of his daughters, Rosa Virginia – have become increasingly visible as Chavez has struggled through three surgeries, chemotherapy, radiation therapy and weeks of convalescence in Cuba.Among them is Diosdado Cabello, whose name means “God-given hair.” A beefy former soldier, Cabello participated with Chavez in a failed and bloody military uprising in 1992 against President Carlos Andres Perez, landing the two of them and several other officers in jail.Cabello, though, is best remembered for his allegiance a decade ago, when Chavez was briefly ousted in a 48-hour coup. Cabello was vice president and became the de facto president, feverishly planning Chavez’s successful return to power from an ornate meeting room in the presidential palace.“Diosdado Cabello is one of Chavez’s centaurs,” said Luis Alberto Butto, a former army lieutenant and university professor who has written extensively about the military influence in Chavez’s government. “When they had to cross the desert, they did it together. Later, they have shared the fruits of power, together. This makes one think that Diosdado Cabello’s strength inside the party is nothing trivial.”Chavez rewards that kind of loyalty: Cabello is now president of the National Assembly as well as a pivotal leader in the president’s all-powerful United Socialist Party.More popular with the public are two longtime cabinet members, Vice President Elias Jaua, a former student radical who has built important links with rural groups, and Nicolas Maduro, who as foreign minister has energetically hopscotched the globe. Maduro is also well regarded by Cuba’s communist government, Venezuela’s closest ally and has been at the president’s side in recent months.“Some see that as a sign that he’s being groomed as a successor, that he has Chavez’s ear as things move forward,” said George Ciccariello-Maher, a Drexel University professor whose upcoming book, “We Created Him,” explores Venezuelan social movements and Chavez’s rise.Semtei, who was part of the movement that helped Chavez consolidate power, said the president might be moved to go with family.Adan Chavez introduced a young Hugo Chavez, then more interested in baseball than revolution, to radical political thought and Marxist guerrillas. He has also had close ties to the Castro brothers in Cuba, which has helped Venezuela improve its intelligence apparatus.Turning to familyThe president also has an option in his daughter Rosa Virginia, who frequently stands next to him during speeches and is married to the minister of science, Jorge Arreaza. The two were often with Chavez in Cuba in recent months as he received medical care.“The past shows us that presidents with so much power traditionally choose someone within their family, like Peron,” said Semtei, referring to Argentine strongman Juan Peron, who upon his 1974 death was succeeded by his wife, Isabel.None of those around Chavez, though, has his potent oratorical skills or his ability to connect with the poor masses, a challenge for the United Socialist Party should the president bow out.Indeed, many of those in his inner circle — including Cabello — have lost elections and fared poorly in polls when eligible voters were asked to pick between them and the opposition candidate, Henrique Capriles .“None of them has the leadership, the ability to project with the Venezuelan people with the magnitude, intensity and profound nature that Chavez can,” Butto said. “That is the misfortune and the dilemma for the party.”Some observers intimately familiar with Chavismo — as the president’s movement is known — say that if the president’s situation worsens markedly there could be chaos because Chavez himself may not name a successor. Under that line of thinking, a messiah-like leader cannot fathom leaving power, even with the end staring him in the face.“He will not cede power as long as he is alive,” said Chavez’s first defense minister, Raul Salazar, a former general who had once closely worked with the president. “He will take to the campaign in a wheelchair, on crutches, any way he can. The only thing that will stop him is death.” by Juan Forero CARACAS, Venezuela – As President Hugo Chavez battles a cancer that has sidelined him for much of the past year, a group of loyal associates has stepped into the spotlight, sparking speculation across a polarized political landscape over who could replace the fiery leader should his condition force him from office.With Chavez running for reelection in October, public talk of relinquishing power is unthinkable in his inner sanctum, where the mantra is “with Chavez everything, without Chavez nothing.” But the uncertainty created by his condition is trumping his efforts to tamp down talk of succession, say those who have had conversations with people in the upper echelon of the populist government.“There are two things they talk about: how the opposition is doing and whether it is growing, and they talk about how sick the chief is and who would replace him,” said Eduardo Semtei, a former government official who had befriended Chavez’s elder brother, Adan, and worked closely with other top officials.Chavez, a messiah-like leader who has amassed broad powers in 13 years of rule, has tried to dispel rumors that his condition would stop him from campaigning, let alone ruling this oil-rich country.
