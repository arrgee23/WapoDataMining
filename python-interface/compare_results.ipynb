       "      <td>It's a big year for women in politics.In a historic first, Hillary Clinton was named the Democratic Party’s presidential nominee in the upcoming U.S. elections. If she wins, she will join Theresa May of Britain and Angela Merkel of Germany in the ranks of women who lead prominent Western democracies.They're not alone, either. In recent years, the number of women holding positions in both parliament and executive government has grown. As of June 2016, women’s membership in parliament doubled from 11.3 percent in 1995 to 22.1 percent in 2015, according to a recent study by the Inter-Parliamentary Union.And this year alone, there have been many historic firsts.In Iran, women won 17 seats during the Islamic Republic’s parliamentary elections in February. “This is a record and we are happy that our dear women are taking part in all stages, especially in politics,” Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said in a speech back in May.Africa has had some of the most dramatic breakthroughs over the past 20 years. As of June, four African nations were part of the top 10 as far as the number of women represented in parliament. Rwanda, for example, tops the chart as the country with the highest number of women represented in parliament in both the lower (63.8 percent) and upper houses (38.5 percent) in 2016.But women remain a relatively small group in parliaments around the world, and progress is slow. Data from the IPU shows that in a vast majority of countries, men still dominate the political stage. In both the lower and upper houses combined, women around the world account for around 22 percent of seats held in parliament.\"Yes it is an improvement considering that it started at a low base,\" Executive Director of U.N. Women Phumzile Mlambo Ngcuka said. \"But if we continue at this pace, it's going to take us too long. We need to fast-track the attainment of gender equality.\"The U.S. is one country that lags the global average of women in the national legislature. It ranks behind 95 countries, including low- and middle-income countries such as Ethiopia, El Salvador and Suriname. Other countries that outperform the United States include Iraq, Afghanistan and Saudi Arabia.One way that countries have been fast-tracking female participation in politics is through gender quotas, and the results have left many surprised. Countries that that have relatively low socioeconomic development or have just emerged from conflict, such as Afghanistan, Tanzania and Ecuador, have shown tremendous improvement and have higher levels of female representation in parliaments.Jennifer Rosen, assistant professor of sociology at Pepperdine University, says emerging democracies give leaders a unique opportunity for leaders to enshrine gender quotas in their new constitutions, helping bypass cultural barriers that would have otherwise stood in the way of women participating in politics for many years.Different electoral systems also influence women's participation in parliament. While scholars agree that proportional representation systems, which allow people to vote for a party list rather than a particular candidate, have a positive influence on female representation in government, some are divided as to whether it has a positive impact on all countries or only on Western democracies.One way for countries to shift their mentalities is to encourage people in executive leadership positions to set an example, Rosen said. Ngcuka, the U.N. women executive director, agrees and said men play an important role and that women shouldn't be the only ones trying to \"move the glass ceiling,\" noting how attitudes change when influential leaders such as Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau nominated a cabinet in 2015 that was half-female.Political parties that are supposed to provide gender quotas need to ensure that they place women in winnable positions, IPU Secretary General Martin Chungong said. \"In many instances they are not walking the walk,\" he said. \"It's not enough to have quotas. We need to provide incentives for people who don't want to implement them.\"What's also clear is that having women in national legislatures can change the way a country is governed. Research shows that when women participate in politics, the conversation gets steered toward issues that their male counterparts often fail to address, such as family planning, education and gender-based violence.\"We have seen that there are certain issues women are better able to articulate,\" Chungong said. \"Women tend to take leading roles not because it is a women's issue, but because it has to do with livelihood of society as a whole.\" More on WorldViewsThe world is getting better at paid maternity leave.

As of June 2016, women’s membership in parliament doubled from 11.3 percent in 1995 to 22.1 percent in 2015, according to a recent study by the Inter-Parliamentary Union.And this year alone, there have been many historic firsts.In Iran, women won 17 seats during the Islamic Republic’s parliamentary elections in February. “This is a record and we are happy that our dear women are taking part in all stages, especially in politics,” Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said in a speech back in May.Africa has had some of the most dramatic breakthroughs over the past 20 years. As of June, four African nations were part of the top 10 as far as the number of women represented in parliament. Rwanda, for example, tops the chart as the country with the highest number of women represented in parliament in both the lower (63.8 percent) and upper houses (38.5 percent) in 2016.But women remain a relatively small group in parliaments around the world, and progress is slow. Data from the IPU shows that in a vast majority of countries, men still dominate the political stage. In both the lower and upper houses combined, women around the world account for around 22 percent of seats held in parliament.\"Yes it is an improvement considering that it started at a low base,\" Executive Director of U.N.

While scholars agree that proportional representation systems, which allow people to vote for a party list rather than a particular candidate, have a positive influence on female representation in government, some are divided as to whether it has a positive impact on all countries or only on Western democracies.One way for countries to shift their mentalities is to encourage people in executive leadership positions to set an example, Rosen said.

       "      <td>At Davos, Sheryl Sandberg’s silence on politics and quotas says it all</td>\n",
       "      <td>In a highly-anticipated session on “Gender-driven Growth” at the World Economic Forum, Facebook’s Sheryl Sandberg seemed to rule out a run for political office, while the IMF’s Christine Lagarde said that quotas were needed to ensure that women get to the top.This discussion took place Saturday, on the last day of the annual meeting in the tony ski resort of Davos, Switzerland, where more than 2,500 of the world’s leaders in economics, politics, business and media gathered for five days of meetings, social events and skiing.After agreeing that the persistent gender gap is due to “a lot” of discrimination, BBC News correspondent and moderator Linda Yueh wanted to know how best to close this gap. Should companies be held to a quota?Lagarde, a lawyer and the first woman to head the International Monetary Fund, said that she used to be totally opposed to gender quotas, finding them offensive. Now, she’s completely changed her mind and is “pro gender quotas,” arguing that “we need targets.”Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka, the undersecretary-general and executive director of UN Women, agreed. “We may not like them,” she acknowledged, “but for now, unfortunately, we need them.” In defending her support of quotas, Mlambo-Ngcuka said that “there’s an assumption that men are there because they’re good.”Carlos Ghosn, chairman and chief executive officer of Renault-Nissan and the only male on the panel, said that Nissan had to go to quotas in Japan to get around the “obvious discrimination.” Although training and coaching women are the most important steps for a company to take, he said that quotas “are important because they lead to action.”(Although the panelists didn’t mention it, the World Economic Forum, itself, established a quota for women two years ago. Despite this, however, women make up a lower percentage of attendees now than before the quota was introduced.)While the other panelists seemed to be effusive in their praise of quotas, Sandberg remained almost uncomfortably silent. And, Yueh didn’t push her.Comments Sandberg’s made over the years, however, show that she’s firmly opposed to using quotas as a way to get women to the top. For example, in response to a question during an NPR interview about whether she felt that she’d been “chosen” as one of the few women talented enough to reach the top, Sandberg said: “It used to be the case, that … there was only room for one or two. Women would look at each other in a room and know that because they were tokens only one of them was getting promoted. … And they were competitive with each other, or at least that’s what I’ve been told.”In her book “Lean In: Women, Work and the Will to Lead,” written with Nell Scovell, Sandberg recounts her anger at being asked whether “it must have helped to be a woman” when Larry Summers, who had been her adviser at Harvard, made her his chief of staff at the Treasury Department in 1999. “It was infuriating,” Sandberg writes. “Their intent may not have been malicious, but the implication was clear. I had not gotten the job on merit.” If the Treasury Department had had an affirmative action program, which it didn’t, Sandberg might have been on shakier ground in defending her promotion.In other words, a quota system risks labeling a woman as a “token” board member, senior executive, or whatever, rather than allowing the woman to be seen as achieving the position on merit.Though she doesn’t support quotas, Sandberg recognizes that women face many overt and covert barriers to getting ahead and cites numerous studies showing that whenever gender is taken out of the issue women do much better. Orchestras that hold blind auditions hire more women; identical resumes with a man’s name are viewed more favorably than those with a woman’s name; students evaluated a Harvard business school case study with Heidi as the entrepreneur much more harshly than when Howard was the entrepreneur; both males and females evaluating job applicants give higher marks to the male applicant, and so on.As Sandberg said in Davos, “If we take gender out, every time women do better.”The session also addressed women and politics. After acknowledging the presence of her good friend Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.) in the audience, Sandberg referred to reports that with 20 members out of 100, women are taking over the Senate. “It’s not a takeover, it’s a problem!” she joked.Lagarde, who is a former French finance minister, lamented that “There aren’t enough women in politics. And, when there are, they do better.”Mlambo-Ngcuka, who had said earlier that the world would be at peace and we’d have better security if more women were in charge, said “it’s important for women to elect women.”At that point, all eyes turned to Sandberg, where there’s been speculation that a run for political office is her inevitable next step.The BBC News moderator asked Sandberg straight out: “Is politics for you?”“Not for me,” Sandberg replied. “I just have a wholesale agreement that we need more women in politics.”</td>\n",

       "      <td>The barriers to women’s political participation in the Middle East have long preoccupied scholars and analysts. The Arab uprisings of early 2011 disrupted virtually every dimension of Arab politics and societies, forcing a systematic reevaluation of many long-held political science theories and assumptions. The place of women in politics and the public sphere was no exception.The divergent experiences of the Arab uprisings and their aftermath have allowed political scientists to take a fresh look at many of these important questions. New data sources and a diversity of cases have energized the community of scholars focused on women’s public political participation. A workshop of the Project on Middle East Political Science (POMEPS) brought together an interdisciplinary group of more than a dozen such scholars in March to critically examine these questions. The complete collection is available to be downloaded free here.Women were highly visible participants in the Arab uprisings of 2011, from the demonstrators on the front lines of Tahrir Square in Cairo to Nobel Peace Prize-winner Tawakkol Karman, the face of the revolution in Yemen. Women’s physical participation in those protests, as Sherine Hafez has observed, became a major point of contention, with narratives of emancipation clashing with experiences of mass public sexual harassment and the gendered exercise of state violence in the form of “virginity tests.”The transitions that followed those uprisings posed particularly fierce challenges to women. The early electoral successes of Islamist parties in Egypt and Tunisia drove many feminists, liberals and Western media platforms to voice concern that the new governments would diminish women’s rights and limit political freedoms. Those fears, as Ellen McLarney documents, escalated with the bitterly contentious negotiations over new constitutions.Many advocates feared that other laws protecting women’s rights, particularly within the family, might also be changed. Autocratic regimes strategically supported certain initiatives that – at least superficially – advanced women’s rights. In Egypt, as Mervat Hatem notes, former first lady Suzanne Mubarak formed the National Council for Women in 2000 that helped pass several laws increasing women’s and girls’ rights in the following decade. Tunisia under President Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali was often held up as a beacon for Western-style women’s empowerment in the region, as the regime focused international attention on women’s rights legislation and away from its systematic repression – which, as Hind Ahmed Zaki documents, included large-scale sexual abuse of female activists.Some women’s rights activists therefore worried that the democratic empowerment of conservative Islamists would come at the expense of their hard-won progress. Many were concerned that the new constitution created under the leadership of former president Mohamed Morsi in 2012 would roll back some of these advances. They were not reassured that, as Ellen McLarney describes, many of the contested sections describing women’s role in the family and society actually originate – some verbatim – in Nasser-era “secular” constitutions and even have roots in the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights.Such politicization of women’s rights was nothing new, of course. As Sherine Hafez describes, both autocratic regimes and democratically elected Islamist governments alike have manipulated the language of women’s rights and utilized female bodies to justify and promote their political goals.But women’s activism, like most other forms of political mobilization in the aftermath of the 2011 uprisings, could not be as easily contained and appropriated as before. Samira Ibrahim sued the military for the sexual assault of its “virginity tests” and, although she was dismissed by Egyptian military leadership as “not like your daughter or mine,” eventually succeeded in revoking the practice.Despite regional authoritarian backsliding as some of the former ruling elite regain power, women’s social organization and political mobilization continue to have an impact in the region. Vickie Langohr illustrates how new forms of activism and large-scale expansion of satellite media have begun to change the public discourse concerning sexual violence in Egypt. Hind Ahmed Zaki describes the Truth and Dignity Commission in Tunisia, which has given women the opportunity to tell their stories of systematic state sexual violence under the Ben Ali regime – although not, as yet, to win prosecution of their abusers.A wide-ranging political science literature on the challenges facing women’s political participation has highlighted variables such as Islamist movements, discourses on nationalism and citizenship, patterns of state development and cultural norms of patriarchy. But these broad discussions often fail to account for disparities in women’s experiences, not only among different states, but also sub-nationally. The scholars in the POMEPS workshop have taken advantage of new data sources, new organizations and campaigns and variation to highlight the diversity of the experience of women across the region.For instance, as Lindsay Benstead points out, countries with almost identical – and relatively high – proportions of women in the formal labor force (such as Yemen, Libya, Tunisia and Morocco) have personal-status laws that range from the most progressive to some of the most conservative in the region.As performance on various indicators of gender equity differs dramatically even within individual countries, suggesting undifferentiated arguments about patriarchy as an explanatory variable without considering intersections of class, privilege or ethnicity is of limited value. Similarly, Scott Weiner’s examination of patriarchy and tribal relations in Kuwait and Oman finds that while kinship relations are highly politically salient in Kuwait, and probably have facilitated the country’s very low levels of female representation in parliament, it actually was the highest-ranked Arab country in the 2014 Global Gender Gap Report.In contrast, Morocco has one of the most progressive personal-status laws in the region and boasts one of the largest percentages of women in parliament, but the gap between male and female literacy in Morocco is second only to that of Yemen among 20 Arab countries. Zakia Salime’s examination of rural women known as the Sulaliyyates fighting for access to tribal land in Morocco illuminates how specific links in tribal communities between women’s subordination in the family and the public sphere work in a country with wide variations in performance on typical indicators of patriarchy.This lack of congruence among different indicators of discrimination leads Benstead to suggest that instead of using patriarchy as a blanket term, political scientists would be better served by learning from feminist theory, particularly Deniz Kandiyoti’s conception of a “patriarchal bargain.” In such a bargain, women’s status across a variety of fields is dependent on the outcome of their negotiations with men, and thus, in the same society, outcomes on various indicators of discrimination can vary widely.While more research is needed to determine how these indicators affect political discrimination, there is consensus about how to improve political representation. Broad cross-national research, such as that by Aili Marie Tripp and Alice Kang, has demonstrated the efficacy of gender quotas. Not only do quotas increase political representation, but, per Benstead’s argument, they also improve female citizens’ access to governmental resources. And although some argue that Western pressure for such quotas would only undermine their prospects, Sarah Bush and Amaney Jamal found little evidence for such an effect on popular perceptions.

       "      <td>In becoming Britain’s second female prime minister, Theresa May has made the country just the sixth in Europe (and 17th in the world) to have had more than one female leader.May, like her female predecessor Margaret Thatcher, is a Conservative. Her party’s main rival, the Labour Party, has had a parade of white male leaders. Although Margaret Beckett and Harriet Harman served as interim Labour Party leaders, neither was elected to that post.Which party has better female representation: Conservative or Labour?So is the Conservative Party beating Labour 2 to 0 in representing women in politics, as former prime minister David Cameron quipped in his final Prime Minister’s Questions? Is it true that the Conservative Party, as Boris Johnson said last week, is “the most progressive party in Britain” when it comes to representing women? No, in at least two important ways.First, on the benches of the House of Commons, only 21 percent of Conservative Party MPs are women — less than half that of the Labour Party, whose MPS are now 43 percent women. In fact, for almost two decades, Labour has consistently had about twice the proportion of women as has the Conservative Party, as the graph below shows.Second, unlike the Conservatives, Labour has consistently used robust policies in selecting candidates to guarantee healthy female representation on their slate.Here’s how Britain’s Labour Party boosted female representation in Parliament More than 100 political parties around the world — including Labour — use what are called “gender quota.” Labour’s gender quota policy, called all-women shortlists, was first used for the 1997 election. It commits the party to considering only female candidates in at least half of all “winnable” seats that come open.The policy’s results were dramatic. That year, the proportion of women in the Parliamentary Labour Party went from 14 percent to 24 percent, and the number of women in parliament overall doubled from 60 to 120. Labour has continued to use all-women shortlists in selecting its candidates for general elections ever since, with one exception. During the 2001 election, a legal challenge made the practice illegal. But a Labour-dominated Parliament amended the Equality Act to accommodate the provision.Here’s how the British Conservative Party tried to boost female representation in Parliament By contrast, the Conservative Party’s attempts to increase the number of female MPs have been significantly less effective. From the mid-2000s, Conservative gender-equality activists pressured party leaders to pay more attention to the underrepresentation of women. May, now prime minister, co-founded one key effort: Women2win, an organization to encourage and support women entering into Conservative Party politics. As Sarah Childs, Paul Webb and Sally Marthaler argued in the journal Political Quarterly, these efforts were important in changing party attitudes.In fact, after being selected party leader in 2005, David Cameron spent much of his acceptance speech promising that the party will “change the scandalous under-representation of women in the Conservative Party.” Within the year, the party introduced what it called priority candidate list — or the “A-List,” of about 150 aspiring candidates, from which local party organizers were encouraged to select. The party promised that the A-List would be at least 50 percent women and that a “significant” proportion would be nonwhite, and also introduced rules for gender-balanced shortlisting during the candidate-selection process.In Political Quarterly, Rosie Campbell, Joni Lovenduski and Childs argued that Cameron’s increased emphasis on getting more women into Parliament was an important evolution of the Conservative Party, raising awareness within the party of the need to “modernize” and appeal to female voters. But relatively few local party constituencies (equivalent to, in the United States, a district party organization) selected women from the A-List, and it was abandoned altogether in 2012. While Conservative Party leaders encouraged them to voluntarily select all-female shortlists themselves, no local party chose to do so. Although more Conservative women were elected in 2010, they still made up only a modest 16 percent of Conservative MPs, a bit more than half of Labour’s 31 percent.So what kinds of policies actually lead to gender equality in politics? Lovenduski in her book “Feminizing Politics” puts attempts to tackle women’s political underrepresentation into three categories: equality rhetoric, equality promotion and equality guarantees. While the Conservative Party in the past decade has had plenty of equality rhetoric and promotion — which Lovenduski considers important steps toward “feminizing politics” — it has stopped short of guaranteeing equality. Labour, by contrast, took steps to guarantee equal representation. Political scientists, such as Mona Lena Krook, have consistently found that robust equality guarantees in the form of gender quotas are the surest route to increasing women’s representation at all levels in politics. The results can be counted.Of course, only the Conservative Party has put women into the top spotIt’s true that the Conservative Party has now put women in the most exceptional position in Britain: that of prime minister. But it has not gone far in diversifying its gender composition. As Diana O’Brien and Karen Beckwith wrote here earlier this week, both Thatcher and May came to power after political crises, which is often the way women become political leaders. That might soon happen in the Labour Party as well; if Angela Eagle succeeds in challenging Jeremy Corbyn for leader, she too may take over at a time of organizational disaster.In other words, even women’s rise to the top of the party may not indicate a commitment to institutional change; rather, it’s a product of political convenience and circumstance.Nugent is a PhD candidate at Rutgers University at New Brunswick, studying women and politics.

       "      <td>Twenty years after the most important U.N. conference on women, what – if anything – has changed?</td>\n",
       "      <td>On Sunday, more than 70 world leaders are expected to participate in a United Nations meeting in New York on gender equality, a 20th anniversary commemoration of the most important United Nations conference on women that was held in Beijing in September 1995 and attended by 37,000 national representatives, U.N. officials, and women’s rights activists. At the Beijing conference, first lady Hillary Clinton famously asserted, “Women’s rights are human rights,” which to this day has inspired women’s mobilization around the globe.But while women around the world were energized in 1995 to take steps to improve their status, the United States has fallen behind in many key areas. When ranked according to women’s legislative representation, the United States slid from 53rd to 76th place in the world over the past 20 years.One of the most enduring legacies of the Beijing conference was that its “Platform for Action” galvanized governments to start adopting measures to increase the political representation of women and to increase their capacity to participate fully in decision-making and leadership. As a result, the proportion of women parliamentarians jumped from 9 percent in 1995 to 22 percent today, according to the Inter-Parliamentary Union.Inspired by the Platform for Action, women’s activists, party activists, and government officials lobbied for the adoption of gender quotas, mandates that increase the likelihood that women are elected to office, usually by requiring a certain percentage of women candidates or reserving women-only seats in the legislature. Countries adopting quotas include both dictatorships and democracies and range from very poor to very rich.Some of the countries with the highest rates of women’s representation are post-conflict countries that adopted quotas. For example, after the genocide in Rwanda, the percent of female parliamentarians leaped spectacularly from 17 percent in 1994 to 64 percent in 2014, the highest level of representation of women in the world today.Today, political parties or governments in more than 111 countries use some form of quota in legislative elections. According to the Quota Project’s latest information, in 49 countries, political parties that are represented in parliament have voluntarily adopted quotas; 52 countries have passed legislation requiring all parties to adopt a quota system; and 24 countries have reserved seats that only women can run for, regardless of party affiliation.We examined the global impact of gender quotas on women’s representation in our 2008 study of 153 countries. Controlling for other factors previously shown to have an impact on representation (e.g., type of electoral system), we found gender quotas to be the strongest factor influencing women’s legislative representation.Even in countries with predominantly Muslim populations that were seen as lagging behind other countries when it came to women’s entry into politics, we began to see significant changes as more countries adopted gender quotas, especially after 2010. For example, women today hold 43 percent of the seats in parliament in predominantly Muslim Senegal. In North Africa the changes are palpable, as women hold 32 percent and 31 percent of the seats in Algeria and Tunisia respectively, which is considerably higher than the 19 percent level found in the United States House (20 percent in the Senate).In the United States and other countries, arguments are raised against gender quotas, but many don’t stand up to scrutiny. For example, the argument that only the most qualified individuals should hold positions of power ignores the fact that parties and leaders often take into consideration other factors, such as geographic representation, and unconsciously or consciously tend to recruit candidates from their own male-dominated networks.In spite of what detractors say, studies show that women who benefit from quotas are as qualified as men. Research by political scientists Susan Franceschet, Jennifer Piscopo, and Diana O’Brien in a recent edited volume finds that male and female lawmakers have similar levels of education or previous electoral experience in countries as diverse as Argentina and Uganda. Both countries have used gender quotas for more than two decades.Another concern about gender quotas is that once in office, female lawmakers may be too timid or too powerless to affect change, but this may have more to do with party dynamics or the national context – where not just female but also male lawmakers encounter obstacles in affecting change.The concern that women may be too inexperienced or uneducated to hold office is challenged by studies of quotas in the world’s largest democracy, India. One widely cited study by Raghabendra Chattopadhyay and Esther Duflo finds that women in positions of power on local village councils respond to women’s demands more so than their male counterparts in the states of West Bengal and Rajasthan. Similarly, research by Lori Beaman and her colleagues finds that the mandated presence of women in politics has a positive impact on voter attitudes to female leaders and girls’ career aspirations and educational outcomes. The gender quotas in the local government gram panchayats were so successful that the government allowed states to increase female representation from 30 percent to 50 percent at all local government levels.Today, quotas have expanded to other areas, such as corporate boards, election commissions, executive cabinets, and the judiciary. International bodies, such as the African Union and the International Criminal Court, have affirmative action principles embedded in them. Quotas have also been used to promote the representation of those living with disabilities and ethnic minorities.Yet, even with increased efforts to boost women’s political representation, the gender gap in politics is one of the largest, especially compared with the gender gap in education and health, where according to the World Economic Forum, it has narrowed considerably. Still today, only 11 heads of state and 13 heads of government are female, while only 17 percent of government ministers are women according to UN Women.An American sounded the clarion call for women’s mobilization two decades ago at the U.N. Beijing Conference. Yet ironically in the United States there is virtually no debate around how to increase women’s political representation as we fall further behind other countries. If something is to be learned from the rest of the world, it is that the introduction of gender quotas has brought more women into political leadership.****Aili Mari Tripp is professor of political science and gender &amp; women’s studies at the University of Wisconsin at Madison.

       "0  In a highly-anticipated session on “Gender-driven Growth” at the World Economic Forum, Facebook’s Sheryl Sandberg seemed to rule out a run for political office, while the IMF’s Christine Lagarde said that quotas were needed to ensure that women get to the top.This discussion took place Saturday, on the last day of the annual meeting in the tony ski resort of Davos, Switzerland, where more than 2,500 of the world’s leaders in economics, politics, business and media gathered for five days of meetings, social events and skiing.After agreeing that the persistent gender gap is due to “a lot” of discrimination, BBC News correspondent and moderator Linda Yueh wanted to know how best to close this gap. Should companies be held to a quota?Lagarde, a lawyer and the first woman to head the International Monetary Fund, said that she used to be totally opposed to gender quotas, finding them offensive. Now, she’s completely changed her mind and is “pro gender quotas,” arguing that “we need targets.”Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka, the undersecretary-general and executive director of UN Women, agreed. “We may not like them,” she acknowledged, “but for now, unfortunately, we need them.” In defending her support of quotas, Mlambo-Ngcuka said that “there’s an assumption that men are there because they’re good.”Carlos Ghosn, chairman and chief executive officer of Renault-Nissan and the only male on the panel, said that Nissan had to go to quotas in Japan to get around the “obvious discrimination.” Although training and coaching women are the most important steps for a company to take, he said that quotas “are important because they lead to action.”(Although the panelists didn’t mention it, the World Economic Forum, itself, established a quota for women two years ago. Despite this, however, women make up a lower percentage of attendees now than before the quota was introduced.)While the other panelists seemed to be effusive in their praise of quotas, Sandberg remained almost uncomfortably silent. And, Yueh didn’t push her.Comments Sandberg’s made over the years, however, show that she’s firmly opposed to using quotas as a way to get women to the top. For example, in response to a question during an NPR interview about whether she felt that she’d been “chosen” as one of the few women talented enough to reach the top, Sandberg said: “It used to be the case, that … there was only room for one or two. Women would look at each other in a room and know that because they were tokens only one of them was getting promoted. … And they were competitive with each other, or at least that’s what I’ve been told.”In her book “Lean In: Women, Work and the Will to Lead,” written with Nell Scovell, Sandberg recounts her anger at being asked whether “it must have helped to be a woman” when Larry Summers, who had been her adviser at Harvard, made her his chief of staff at the Treasury Department in 1999. “It was infuriating,” Sandberg writes. “Their intent may not have been malicious, but the implication was clear. I had not gotten the job on merit.” If the Treasury Department had had an affirmative action program, which it didn’t, Sandberg might have been on shakier ground in defending her promotion.In other words, a quota system risks labeling a woman as a “token” board member, senior executive, or whatever, rather than allowing the woman to be seen as achieving the position on merit.Though she doesn’t support quotas, Sandberg recognizes that women face many overt and covert barriers to getting ahead and cites numerous studies showing that whenever gender is taken out of the issue women do much better. Orchestras that hold blind auditions hire more women; identical resumes with a man’s name are viewed more favorably than those with a woman’s name; students evaluated a Harvard business school case study with Heidi as the entrepreneur much more harshly than when Howard was the entrepreneur; both males and females evaluating job applicants give higher marks to the male applicant, and so on.As Sandberg said in Davos, “If we take gender out, every time women do better.”The session also addressed women and politics. After acknowledging the presence of her good friend Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.) in the audience, Sandberg referred to reports that with 20 members out of 100, women are taking over the Senate. “It’s not a takeover, it’s a problem!” she joked.Lagarde, who is a former French finance minister, lamented that “There aren’t enough women in politics. And, when there are, they do better.”Mlambo-Ngcuka, who had said earlier that the world would be at peace and we’d have better security if more women were in charge, said “it’s important for women to elect women.”At that point, all eyes turned to Sandberg, where there’s been speculation that a run for political office is her inevitable next step.The BBC News moderator asked Sandberg straight out: “Is politics for you?”“Not for me,” Sandberg replied. “I just have a wholesale agreement that we need more women in politics.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",
       "1  It's a big year for women in politics.In a historic first, Hillary Clinton was named the Democratic Party’s presidential nominee in the upcoming U.S. elections. If she wins, she will join Theresa May of Britain and Angela Merkel of Germany in the ranks of women who lead prominent Western democracies.They're not alone, either. In recent years, the number of women holding positions in both parliament and executive government has grown. As of June 2016, women’s membership in parliament doubled from 11.3 percent in 1995 to 22.1 percent in 2015, according to a recent study by the Inter-Parliamentary Union.And this year alone, there have been many historic firsts.In Iran, women won 17 seats during the Islamic Republic’s parliamentary elections in February. “This is a record and we are happy that our dear women are taking part in all stages, especially in politics,” Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said in a speech back in May.Africa has had some of the most dramatic breakthroughs over the past 20 years. As of June, four African nations were part of the top 10 as far as the number of women represented in parliament. Rwanda, for example, tops the chart as the country with the highest number of women represented in parliament in both the lower (63.8 percent) and upper houses (38.5 percent) in 2016.But women remain a relatively small group in parliaments around the world, and progress is slow. Data from the IPU shows that in a vast majority of countries, men still dominate the political stage. In both the lower and upper houses combined, women around the world account for around 22 percent of seats held in parliament.\"Yes it is an improvement considering that it started at a low base,\" Executive Director of U.N. Women Phumzile Mlambo Ngcuka said. \"But if we continue at this pace, it's going to take us too long. We need to fast-track the attainment of gender equality.\"The U.S. is one country that lags the global average of women in the national legislature. It ranks behind 95 countries, including low- and middle-income countries such as Ethiopia, El Salvador and Suriname. Other countries that outperform the United States include Iraq, Afghanistan and Saudi Arabia.One way that countries have been fast-tracking female participation in politics is through gender quotas, and the results have left many surprised. Countries that that have relatively low socioeconomic development or have just emerged from conflict, such as Afghanistan, Tanzania and Ecuador, have shown tremendous improvement and have higher levels of female representation in parliaments.Jennifer Rosen, assistant professor of sociology at Pepperdine University, says emerging democracies give leaders a unique opportunity for leaders to enshrine gender quotas in their new constitutions, helping bypass cultural barriers that would have otherwise stood in the way of women participating in politics for many years.Different electoral systems also influence women's participation in parliament. While scholars agree that proportional representation systems, which allow people to vote for a party list rather than a particular candidate, have a positive influence on female representation in government, some are divided as to whether it has a positive impact on all countries or only on Western democracies.One way for countries to shift their mentalities is to encourage people in executive leadership positions to set an example, Rosen said. Ngcuka, the U.N. women executive director, agrees and said men play an important role and that women shouldn't be the only ones trying to \"move the glass ceiling,\" noting how attitudes change when influential leaders such as Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau nominated a cabinet in 2015 that was half-female.Political parties that are supposed to provide gender quotas need to ensure that they place women in winnable positions, IPU Secretary General Martin Chungong said. \"In many instances they are not walking the walk,\" he said. \"It's not enough to have quotas. We need to provide incentives for people who don't want to implement them.\"What's also clear is that having women in national legislatures can change the way a country is governed. Research shows that when women participate in politics, the conversation gets steered toward issues that their male counterparts often fail to address, such as family planning, education and gender-based violence.\"We have seen that there are certain issues women are better able to articulate,\" Chungong said. \"Women tend to take leading roles not because it is a women's issue, but because it has to do with livelihood of society as a whole.\" More on WorldViewsThe world is getting better at paid maternity leave.

       "2  The barriers to women’s political participation in the Middle East have long preoccupied scholars and analysts. The Arab uprisings of early 2011 disrupted virtually every dimension of Arab politics and societies, forcing a systematic reevaluation of many long-held political science theories and assumptions. The place of women in politics and the public sphere was no exception.The divergent experiences of the Arab uprisings and their aftermath have allowed political scientists to take a fresh look at many of these important questions. New data sources and a diversity of cases have energized the community of scholars focused on women’s public political participation. A workshop of the Project on Middle East Political Science (POMEPS) brought together an interdisciplinary group of more than a dozen such scholars in March to critically examine these questions. The complete collection is available to be downloaded free here.Women were highly visible participants in the Arab uprisings of 2011, from the demonstrators on the front lines of Tahrir Square in Cairo to Nobel Peace Prize-winner Tawakkol Karman, the face of the revolution in Yemen. Women’s physical participation in those protests, as Sherine Hafez has observed, became a major point of contention, with narratives of emancipation clashing with experiences of mass public sexual harassment and the gendered exercise of state violence in the form of “virginity tests.”The transitions that followed those uprisings posed particularly fierce challenges to women. The early electoral successes of Islamist parties in Egypt and Tunisia drove many feminists, liberals and Western media platforms to voice concern that the new governments would diminish women’s rights and limit political freedoms. Those fears, as Ellen McLarney documents, escalated with the bitterly contentious negotiations over new constitutions.Many advocates feared that other laws protecting women’s rights, particularly within the family, might also be changed. Autocratic regimes strategically supported certain initiatives that – at least superficially – advanced women’s rights. In Egypt, as Mervat Hatem notes, former first lady Suzanne Mubarak formed the National Council for Women in 2000 that helped pass several laws increasing women’s and girls’ rights in the following decade. Tunisia under President Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali was often held up as a beacon for Western-style women’s empowerment in the region, as the regime focused international attention on women’s rights legislation and away from its systematic repression – which, as Hind Ahmed Zaki documents, included large-scale sexual abuse of female activists.Some women’s rights activists therefore worried that the democratic empowerment of conservative Islamists would come at the expense of their hard-won progress. Many were concerned that the new constitution created under the leadership of former president Mohamed Morsi in 2012 would roll back some of these advances. They were not reassured that, as Ellen McLarney describes, many of the contested sections describing women’s role in the family and society actually originate – some verbatim – in Nasser-era “secular” constitutions and even have roots in the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights.Such politicization of women’s rights was nothing new, of course. As Sherine Hafez describes, both autocratic regimes and democratically elected Islamist governments alike have manipulated the language of women’s rights and utilized female bodies to justify and promote their political goals.But women’s activism, like most other forms of political mobilization in the aftermath of the 2011 uprisings, could not be as easily contained and appropriated as before. Samira Ibrahim sued the military for the sexual assault of its “virginity tests” and, although she was dismissed by Egyptian military leadership as “not like your daughter or mine,” eventually succeeded in revoking the practice.Despite regional authoritarian backsliding as some of the former ruling elite regain power, women’s social organization and political mobilization continue to have an impact in the region. Vickie Langohr illustrates how new forms of activism and large-scale expansion of satellite media have begun to change the public discourse concerning sexual violence in Egypt. Hind Ahmed Zaki describes the Truth and Dignity Commission in Tunisia, which has given women the opportunity to tell their stories of systematic state sexual violence under the Ben Ali regime – although not, as yet, to win prosecution of their abusers.A wide-ranging political science literature on the challenges facing women’s political participation has highlighted variables such as Islamist movements, discourses on nationalism and citizenship, patterns of state development and cultural norms of patriarchy. But these broad discussions often fail to account for disparities in women’s experiences, not only among different states, but also sub-nationally. The scholars in the POMEPS workshop have taken advantage of new data sources, new organizations and campaigns and variation to highlight the diversity of the experience of women across the region.For instance, as Lindsay Benstead points out, countries with almost identical – and relatively high – proportions of women in the formal labor force (such as Yemen, Libya, Tunisia and Morocco) have personal-status laws that range from the most progressive to some of the most conservative in the region.As performance on various indicators of gender equity differs dramatically even within individual countries, suggesting undifferentiated arguments about patriarchy as an explanatory variable without considering intersections of class, privilege or ethnicity is of limited value. Similarly, Scott Weiner’s examination of patriarchy and tribal relations in Kuwait and Oman finds that while kinship relations are highly politically salient in Kuwait, and probably have facilitated the country’s very low levels of female representation in parliament, it actually was the highest-ranked Arab country in the 2014 Global Gender Gap Report.In contrast, Morocco has one of the most progressive personal-status laws in the region and boasts one of the largest percentages of women in parliament, but the gap between male and female literacy in Morocco is second only to that of Yemen among 20 Arab countries. Zakia Salime’s examination of rural women known as the Sulaliyyates fighting for access to tribal land in Morocco illuminates how specific links in tribal communities between women’s subordination in the family and the public sphere work in a country with wide variations in performance on typical indicators of patriarchy.This lack of congruence among different indicators of discrimination leads Benstead to suggest that instead of using patriarchy as a blanket term, political scientists would be better served by learning from feminist theory, particularly Deniz Kandiyoti’s conception of a “patriarchal bargain.” In such a bargain, women’s status across a variety of fields is dependent on the outcome of their negotiations with men, and thus, in the same society, outcomes on various indicators of discrimination can vary widely.While more research is needed to determine how these indicators affect political discrimination, there is consensus about how to improve political representation. Broad cross-national research, such as that by Aili Marie Tripp and Alice Kang, has demonstrated the efficacy of gender quotas. Not only do quotas increase political representation, but, per Benstead’s argument, they also improve female citizens’ access to governmental resources. And although some argue that Western pressure for such quotas would only undermine their prospects, Sarah Bush and Amaney Jamal found little evidence for such an effect on popular perceptions. Although cynics might assume that women in Arab parliaments are merely a form of window dressing, Marwa Shalaby notes that while women make u  \n",
       "3  In becoming Britain’s second female prime minister, Theresa May has made the country just the sixth in Europe (and 17th in the world) to have had more than one female leader.May, like her female predecessor Margaret Thatcher, is a Conservative. Her party’s main rival, the Labour Party, has had a parade of white male leaders. Although Margaret Beckett and Harriet Harman served as interim Labour Party leaders, neither was elected to that post.Which party has better female representation: Conservative or Labour?So is the Conservative Party beating Labour 2 to 0 in representing women in politics, as former prime minister David Cameron quipped in his final Prime Minister’s Questions? Is it true that the Conservative Party, as Boris Johnson said last week, is “the most progressive party in Britain” when it comes to representing women? No, in at least two important ways.First, on the benches of the House of Commons, only 21 percent of Conservative Party MPs are women — less than half that of the Labour Party, whose MPS are now 43 percent women. In fact, for almost two decades, Labour has consistently had about twice the proportion of women as has the Conservative Party, as the graph below shows.Second, unlike the Conservatives, Labour has consistently used robust policies in selecting candidates to guarantee healthy female representation on their slate.Here’s how Britain’s Labour Party boosted female representation in Parliament More than 100 political parties around the world — including Labour — use what are called “gender quota.” Labour’s gender quota policy, called all-women shortlists, was first used for the 1997 election. It commits the party to considering only female candidates in at least half of all “winnable” seats that come open.The policy’s results were dramatic. That year, the proportion of women in the Parliamentary Labour Party went from 14 percent to 24 percent, and the number of women in parliament overall doubled from 60 to 120. Labour has continued to use all-women shortlists in selecting its candidates for general elections ever since, with one exception. During the 2001 election, a legal challenge made the practice illegal. But a Labour-dominated Parliament amended the Equality Act to accommodate the provision.Here’s how the British Conservative Party tried to boost female representation in Parliament By contrast, the Conservative Party’s attempts to increase the number of female MPs have been significantly less effective. From the mid-2000s, Conservative gender-equality activists pressured party leaders to pay more attention to the underrepresentation of women. May, now prime minister, co-founded one key effort: Women2win, an organization to encourage and support women entering into Conservative Party politics. As Sarah Childs, Paul Webb and Sally Marthaler argued in the journal Political Quarterly, these efforts were important in changing party attitudes.In fact, after being selected party leader in 2005, David Cameron spent much of his acceptance speech promising that the party will “change the scandalous under-representation of women in the Conservative Party.” Within the year, the party introduced what it called priority candidate list — or the “A-List,” of about 150 aspiring candidates, from which local party organizers were encouraged to select. The party promised that the A-List would be at least 50 percent women and that a “significant” proportion would be nonwhite, and also introduced rules for gender-balanced shortlisting during the candidate-selection process.In Political Quarterly, Rosie Campbell, Joni Lovenduski and Childs argued that Cameron’s increased emphasis on getting more women into Parliament was an important evolution of the Conservative Party, raising awareness within the party of the need to “modernize” and appeal to female voters. But relatively few local party constituencies (equivalent to, in the United States, a district party organization) selected women from the A-List, and it was abandoned altogether in 2012. While Conservative Party leaders encouraged them to voluntarily select all-female shortlists themselves, no local party chose to do so. Although more Conservative women were elected in 2010, they still made up only a modest 16 percent of Conservative MPs, a bit more than half of Labour’s 31 percent.So what kinds of policies actually lead to gender equality in politics? Lovenduski in her book “Feminizing Politics” puts attempts to tackle women’s political underrepresentation into three categories: equality rhetoric, equality promotion and equality guarantees. While the Conservative Party in the past decade has had plenty of equality rhetoric and promotion — which Lovenduski considers important steps toward “feminizing politics” — it has stopped short of guaranteeing equality. Labour, by contrast, took steps to guarantee equal representation. Political scientists, such as Mona Lena Krook, have consistently found that robust equality guarantees in the form of gender quotas are the surest route to increasing women’s representation at all levels in politics. The results can be counted.Of course, only the Conservative Party has put women into the top spotIt’s true that the Conservative Party has now put women in the most exceptional position in Britain: that of prime minister. But it has not gone far in diversifying its gender composition. As Diana O’Brien and Karen Beckwith wrote here earlier this week, both Thatcher and May came to power after political crises, which is often the way women become political leaders. That might soon happen in the Labour Party as well; if Angela Eagle succeeds in challenging Jeremy Corbyn for leader, she too may take over at a time of organizational disaster.In other words, even women’s rise to the top of the party may not indicate a commitment to institutional change; rather, it’s a product of political convenience and circumstance.Nugent is a PhD candidate at Rutgers University at New Brunswick, studying women and politics.

       "4  On Sunday, more than 70 world leaders are expected to participate in a United Nations meeting in New York on gender equality, a 20th anniversary commemoration of the most important United Nations conference on women that was held in Beijing in September 1995 and attended by 37,000 national representatives, U.N. officials, and women’s rights activists. At the Beijing conference, first lady Hillary Clinton famously asserted, “Women’s rights are human rights,” which to this day has inspired women’s mobilization around the globe.But while women around the world were energized in 1995 to take steps to improve their status, the United States has fallen behind in many key areas. When ranked according to women’s legislative representation, the United States slid from 53rd to 76th place in the world over the past 20 years.One of the most enduring legacies of the Beijing conference was that its “Platform for Action” galvanized governments to start adopting measures to increase the political representation of women and to increase their capacity to participate fully in decision-making and leadership. As a result, the proportion of women parliamentarians jumped from 9 percent in 1995 to 22 percent today, according to the Inter-Parliamentary Union.Inspired by the Platform for Action, women’s activists, party activists, and government officials lobbied for the adoption of gender quotas, mandates that increase the likelihood that women are elected to office, usually by requiring a certain percentage of women candidates or reserving women-only seats in the legislature. Countries adopting quotas include both dictatorships and democracies and range from very poor to very rich.Some of the countries with the highest rates of women’s representation are post-conflict countries that adopted quotas. For example, after the genocide in Rwanda, the percent of female parliamentarians leaped spectacularly from 17 percent in 1994 to 64 percent in 2014, the highest level of representation of women in the world today.Today, political parties or governments in more than 111 countries use some form of quota in legislative elections. According to the Quota Project’s latest information, in 49 countries, political parties that are represented in parliament have voluntarily adopted quotas; 52 countries have passed legislation requiring all parties to adopt a quota system; and 24 countries have reserved seats that only women can run for, regardless of party affiliation.We examined the global impact of gender quotas on women’s representation in our 2008 study of 153 countries. Controlling for other factors previously shown to have an impact on representation (e.g., type of electoral system), we found gender quotas to be the strongest factor influencing women’s legislative representation.Even in countries with predominantly Muslim populations that were seen as lagging behind other countries when it came to women’s entry into politics, we began to see significant changes as more countries adopted gender quotas, especially after 2010. For example, women today hold 43 percent of the seats in parliament in predominantly Muslim Senegal. In North Africa the changes are palpable, as women hold 32 percent and 31 percent of the seats in Algeria and Tunisia respectively, which is considerably higher than the 19 percent level found in the United States House (20 percent in the Senate).In the United States and other countries, arguments are raised against gender quotas, but many don’t stand up to scrutiny. For example, the argument that only the most qualified individuals should hold positions of power ignores the fact that parties and leaders often take into consideration other factors, such as geographic representation, and unconsciously or consciously tend to recruit candidates from their own male-dominated networks.In spite of what detractors say, studies show that women who benefit from quotas are as qualified as men. Research by political scientists Susan Franceschet, Jennifer Piscopo, and Diana O’Brien in a recent edited volume finds that male and female lawmakers have similar levels of education or previous electoral experience in countries as diverse as Argentina and Uganda. Both countries have used gender quotas for more than two decades.Another concern about gender quotas is that once in office, female lawmakers may be too timid or too powerless to affect change, but this may have more to do with party dynamics or the national context – where not just female but also male lawmakers encounter obstacles in affecting change.The concern that women may be too inexperienced or uneducated to hold office is challenged by studies of quotas in the world’s largest democracy, India. One widely cited study by Raghabendra Chattopadhyay and Esther Duflo finds that women in positions of power on local village councils respond to women’s demands more so than their male counterparts in the states of West Bengal and Rajasthan. Similarly, research by Lori Beaman and her colleagues finds that the mandated presence of women in politics has a positive impact on voter attitudes to female leaders and girls’ career aspirations and educational outcomes. The gender quotas in the local government gram panchayats were so successful that the government allowed states to increase female representation from 30 percent to 50 percent at all local government levels.Today, quotas have expanded to other areas, such as corporate boards, election commissions, executive cabinets, and the judiciary. International bodies, such as the African Union and the International Criminal Court, have affirmative action principles embedded in them. Quotas have also been used to promote the representation of those living with disabilities and ethnic minorities.Yet, even with increased efforts to boost women’s political representation, the gender gap in politics is one of the largest, especially compared with the gender gap in education and health, where according to the World Economic Forum, it has narrowed considerably. Still today, only 11 heads of state and 13 heads of government are female, while only 17 percent of government ministers are women according to UN Women.An American sounded the clarion call for women’s mobilization two decades ago at the U.N. Beijing Conference. Yet ironically in the United States there is virtually no debate around how to increase women’s political representation as we fall further behind other countries. If something is to be learned from the rest of the world, it is that the introduction of gender quotas has brought more women into political leadership.****Aili Mari Tripp is professor of political science and gender & women’s studies at the University of Wisconsin at Madison.

       "      <td>A record-breaking number of women were elected to the British Parliament in Thursday’s election, with many calling it a “historic” moment. When legislators return to Westminster next week, there will be 208 women among their ranks, or 32 percent of Parliament. The majority of the parties are also led by women. In fact, Prime Minister Theresa May is now negotiating with another woman, Arlene Foster of Northern Ireland’s Democratic Unionist Party, to form a government.But is this election really a turning point for women in the United Kingdom?Despite the headlines, these results represent only an incremental change — a gain of just 12 more seats for women. And although women might be better represented in Parliament than in the U.S. Congress, the United Kingdom still lags behind most European and Latin American democracies. Thursday’s election moved it from 46 to 39 in the global rankings. Focusing on the headline number also obscures significant variation across parties and regions.The parties aren’t alikeAs with the Democrats in the United States, women’s representation is highest in the center-left Labour Party. Women hold 45 percent of Labour seats (119 of 262) compared with 21 percent of Conservative seats. In fact, the number of women parliamentarians in the Conservative Party actually decreased from 70 to 67 in this election.The difference between the parties is because of a strategy — “all-women shortlists” — adopted by the Labour Party in 1994. Labour requires that half of all winnable seats be contested by female candidates. When it was partially implemented for the first time in 1997, women’s numbers grew from 37 to 101. Since being fully implemented from 2005 onwards, women’s representation has never fallen below 27 percent.Scotland is different, tooThere is also variation within the U.K. itself. Women’s representation actually decreased in Scotland. This is in large part because of the Conservative gains in the region: among the thirteen returning members of Parliament, only one is a woman. And this is despite the striking prominence of women in Scottish politics, where the leaders of the three major parties are all women, and First Minister Nicola Sturgeon appointed a gender-balanced Cabinet.The U.K. isn’t close to gender parityThe U.K. remains a long way from gender parity in Parliament. To get there, the Conservatives will have to increase the number of female candidates competing in winnable seats. They’ve tried to bolster women’s numbers before through “soft” measures — such as the Women2Win initiative co-founded by Theresa May to support and train Conservative women, and the gender balanced “priority list” of prospective candidates that local parties were encouraged to select from (although it proved unpopular and was soon abandoned).Despite acknowledging the need for more women in politics, the Conservative Party remains opposed to a strategy like all-women shortlists. Their resistance is not surprising. While there are right-leaning parties in Western Europe with voluntary quotas (including the German Christian Democrats and Austrian People’s Party), no conservative party in the region has been willing to implement this strategy.Moreover, Britain, unlike more than 75 countries across the globe, has not adopted legislation that mandates the selection or election of female candidates for office. A growing number of European countries have done so, including France in 1999, Ireland in 2012 and Poland in 2011.What comes next? One crucial issue on the agenda: women’s reproductive rights. The governing coalition will likely include the Conservative Party and Northern Ireland’s Democratic Unionist Party, and the DUP has consistently campaigned to limit abortion rights. The DUP’s former health minister, Jim Wells, has even argued against abortion in cases of rape. Newly elected MP Owen Paterson confirmed in an interview yesterday that abortion restrictions might be up for debate.At the same time, May’s position is precarious, and many observers do not expect this fragile coalition to last long. If new elections are on the horizon, then we will soon see whether there will be further increases in women’s representation — and if so, what that means for public policy.Mary Nugent is a PhD candidate in political science at Rutgers University.

       "      <td>Where do African women have more power? Surprise — in countries emerging from war.</td>\n",
       "      <td>When I went to Uganda in 1992, I was interested in understanding why the country had so many women in top government positions and why it had the highest rates of representation of women in parliament in Africa at the time. During my research, I realized that a key reason was war. Uganda had just emerged from years of major conflict. Relations between women and men had begun to change, and as a result, women started to mobilize for their rights.Over time, it became evident that post-conflict countries had considerably higher rates of female political representation than countries that had not suffered through violence. Post-conflict Liberia was the first African country to elect a woman president. As early as 1994, post-conflict Uganda already had a woman vice president for 10 years. Post-conflict Rwanda today has the highest rate of female legislative representation in the world – 63.8 percent of its legislators are women – and has held that spot since 2003.My latest book, “Women and Power in Postconflict Africa” (Cambridge University Press 2015), shows how the trends I observed in Uganda in the early 1990s became evident in many of the 16 other African countries that came out of conflict, especially after 2000. Across Africa, countries emerging from major conflict were quicker to advance women’s rights and elect women to political office than countries that had remained less conflicted. What is more, post-conflict nations went further in changing their laws and constitutions, offering women more strong legal protections in the areas of land rights, family law, violence and political equality.And it is not just in Africa. We see more women in office after conflict around the world, in such places as Slovenia, Nepal and East Timor.This post-1990s pattern echoes earlier transformations in women’s citizenship, when World War I shook up gender norms across Europe and the United States. Women mobilized for the vote in many countries for decades, but it was only after the war that they finally gained suffrage.The book is based both on extensive fieldwork in Uganda, Liberia and Angola, and on in-depth analysis that compares post-conflict and non-conflict countries across Africa. It also builds on a longitudinal study that I carried out with Melanie Hughes, in which we found statistical evidence of the relationship between women’s legislative representation and the end of major wars that were particularly long or had very high rates of conflict-related deaths.Advancing women’s rights is an unexpected byproduct of warThe Nordic countries took more than 100 years to get equal numbers of women and men in their legislatures. After civil wars, some African countries exceeded their rates almost overnight.None of this, however, happened before the 1990s, a time when women’s rights activists had made gains in legal reform in many African countries and pressured United Nations agencies, foreign donors and international organizations to promote those rights worldwide.Of course, women’s rights activists in post-conflict countries say that the changes have been all too slow and halting. But even the impatience with the the pace of change tells us how much expectations have been transformed. In nondemocratic countries such as Angola, Chad and Eritrea, we see fewer changes, in part because citizens have few political rights and civil liberties.But looking at the big picture in a country like Uganda, we see new women leaders in business, civil society, academia, religious institutions and a host of institutions in which they had previously been invisible. We also see changes in attitudes toward women and women’s leadership. In some countries the changes were more extensive than others, where sometimes one saw change only along a few dimensions.In Angola, for example, women increased their numbers in the legislature but won fewer legal and constitutional rights. But that is, in part, because Angola is not a democracy, and so women were not able to create organizations independent of the government and other dominant political powers. Creating a women’s rights agenda requires women to build coalitions across parties, ethnicities and other identities and affiliations – which can then make demands of the ruling party.Why did post-conflict countries advance women’s status so quickly? Here is why. During conflicts, women are pushed into new roles in the economy, in their households and communities and even in national politics. While some women also fought, others became active in peace movements, which have often been led by women or involved large numbers of women – and then use the transition to peace as a time to demand equality.In Africa, for instance, women were among those most engaged in behind-the-scenes peacemaking, pressuring militia to lay down their arms, demonstrating for peaceful elections and negotiating the release of kidnapped civilians. Further, women gain credibility after these conflicts, since they have been political outsiders, uninvolved with leading the militias and paramilitaries and not responsible for the violence – making a vote for a woman seen as a break with the disastrously violent status quo.From these positions, women often try to influence peace negotiations to include women’s rights planks into the peace accords. The results include quotas for women on candidate slates; explicit listing of sexual violence as a war crime during transitional justice processes, and requirements to include women at the table where new constitutions are being written. Sometimes international donors and other international actors supported and pressured for these results.Some kinds of conflict produced more advances in women’s rights than others While no one would ever advocate war as a route to advancing women, my research showed that the longer or more deadly the war, the more advances women make. That is, in part, because when society is seriously ruptured by war, it is easier to persuade people to adopt new norms, institutions and include new political actors.Further, after a civil war, women’s rights had a better chance of improving if the conflict ended with peace negotiations rather than a decisive victory for one side, as happened in Angola and Sri Lanka. Women and international non-governmental organizations had less power to add women’s rights to the laws and constitutions if one dominant side simply took power than if they were at the table while peace was negotiated and constitutions were rewritten.Finally, women made more advances after major civil wars or wars of national liberation than after interstate or proxy wars, or after low-level conflict, local rebellions or coups d’état. For instance, consider the ongoing conflict in Somalia. There is not enough stability for leaders to worry about legislative reform – and so we should not expect much legal change with respect to women’s status during conflict.Aili Mari Tripp is a professor of political science and gender and women’s studies at the University of Wisconsin at Madison.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Western European countries have long led the world on gender equality, but the latest annual Gender Gap Report, just issued by the World Economic Forum, shows that the U.S. is making significant gains in an area where it has often lagged the Western world.The annual WEF report grades countries on five metrics to measure the degree of gender equality or inequality: economic participation and opportunity, educational attainment, health and survival, and political empowerment. Countries are scored between 0.0 for most unequal, meaning that women have zero access, or 1.0 for fully equal.The 2012 report ranks the U.S. 22nd in the world. The only non-Western nations that rank higher than the U.S., meaning their societies are more equal for women, are South Africa, Cuba, Lesotho, Nicaragua, and the Philippines. American society has been catching up to its historical leaders, as this chart of WEF gender equality scores across Western Europe since 2006 shows.I haven't included Scandinavian countries in this chart. Their scores are so high that it would make it to difficult to portray the U.S.'s relative gains against the rest of Western Europe. But what's also striking about this is the relatively poor gender equality in two of Western Europe's largest economies and more liberal societies: France and Italy.In the broader European context, the U.S. is in fact a better place for women, judging by the WEF data, than is the majority of the continent. Here's a map of Europe, color-coded by gender equality. The blue countries are, according to the WEF data, more accessible societies for women than is the United States, with darker blue signifying better scores. The red countries are less friendly societies for women, with darker red signifying worse scores.This map tells a few different stories. The first is the striking degrees of inequality that remain in Western Europe. In the cases of Spain and France, that has worsened considerably over recent years. The second is the remarkable successes that women have found in Scandinavian countries, by far the most equal for women in the world. And perhaps the third would be the deep problems of gender inequality that persist in much of the former Soviet Union. I'll be looking more into several of these issues throughout the day, so check back.</td>\n",

       "      <td>On election night in November, many cheered a relative milestone: For the first time ever, there would be more than 100 women in the U.S. Congress. Yet while that may be a record high, it doesn't look as impressive when compared with other high-income nations — or even many lower-income ones.The Pew Research Center released a data analysis Monday of a 2014 World Economic Forum report on the gender gap. The analysis examined how the U.S. compares to other countries when it comes to having women in top government posts, and the results aren't reassuring.Among 49 \"high income\" countries, the United States ranks 33rd when it comes to women in legislative roles. Sweden was first. Meanwhile, among a larger group of 137 countries, it came in 83rd. Pew notes that the WEF data is from May 2014, but that even if numbers from the current Congress were analyzed, the United States would still come in just 75th.America did better in other categories, but still fell behind many of its peers. Among high-income countries, it tied with Canada for 12th place on the share of Cabinet-level positions held by women. Among all countries, it was 25th. In this case, however, Pew found that the ratio of U.S. Cabinet positions held by women has actually gone down since the WEF's report, which presumably would mean the U.S. ranking could be even lower.One category in which the United States fared better was that of \"legislators, senior officials and managers.\" It tied for fourth place among high-income countries — with Barbados and Trinidad and Tobago — in this ranking that measures women's representation across multiple leadership positions including corporate managers, legislators, top political party officials and nonprofit leaders. (When the larger group of countries was analyzed, it was tied for 16th with Namibia.)What's holding women back in the United States? Pew addressed that question as part of its Women and Leadership survey, the first in a series of reports about the topic, of which this analysis is a part. In the survey, 38 percent of respondents said more women did not reach higher political office because they are held to higher standards, while 37 percent thought it was because others weren't ready to elect them. Just 17 percent attributed the low numbers to women's family responsibilities, and 27 percent to a lack of support from political parties.Read also:More than 100 women in Congress for the first time—and not much growthBecky Hammon's path to the NBALike On Leadership?

       "      <td>It's still months until September, when Britain's next prime minister will be named, and November, when the United States will elect its next president. But the political turmoil that's erupted following Britain's vote to leave the European Union has put in place the possibility of a profoundly historic moment: By next January, women could lead the three largest Western economies.Yes, it's early, and yes, it's still totally speculative. But the possibility that women could lead the United States, Britain and Germany at the same time is also a very real one. Angela Merkel's term as chancellor of Germany is not up until the fall of 2017, when the country will hold its next election. Hillary Clinton is poised to become the first female nominee of a major U.S. political party, and she is currently leading in many polls against Donald Trump, the presumptive GOP nominee.And with the decision by former London Mayor Boris Johnson not to run to be the Conservative Party's next leader -- who will replace David Cameron in September as Britain's prime minister -- Home Secretary Theresa May has vaulted into the lead as the favorite among British oddsmakers. Meanwhile, a YouGov/Times poll also put her in the lead, though it did not include Michael Gove, the justice secretary who had repeatedly said he didn't want the job but shocked Britain Thursday with the announcement that he did.\"This is not crazy stuff -- it's a moment to take note of,\" said Debbie Walsh, director of the Center for American Women in Politics at Rutgers University. \"Even the fact, honestly, that two women are among the two leading candidates [in the U.S. and Britain] -- that it could even possibly happen -- is in and of itself historic. It’s really extraordinary. There’s never been anything like that before, where it was even in the realm of possibility, let alone happen.\" Britain, of course, has had a female prime minister before: Margaret Thatcher served from 1979 to 1990. Merkel is Germany's first female chancellor, a position she has held since 2005. The United States, meanwhile, has never had a female nominee from a major political party.May voted to remain in the European Union, though she is noted to have done so \"gently,\" keeping a low profile and still finding fans among \"Euroskeptics\" for her immigration policies. That position could make her less attractive as the person to negotiate Britain's exit -- or it could make her be seen as more of a unifier, a role she is casting herself in. \"That's nice middle ground at a moment when Great Britain is quite at odds with itself about this decision,\" Walsh said.Then there is also Marine Le Pen, who leads the far right National Front party in France. The next French presidential election will be in the spring of 2017, which the Post's Michael Birnbaum writes \"appears ripe for an insurgent candidate such as Le Pen,\" particularly after the recent Brexit vote. He reports that while she leads many polls for France's crowded first round of voting, she falls behind Hollande in the second, head-to-head vote.If in fact there do end up being two, or three, or even more women around the table at the next G-8 Summit, Walsh says that image could radically reshuffle how we view the opportunity for getting women into global leadership roles. \"It could disrupt our image of who world leaders can be,\" she said, \"and would do so at a very, very high level.\"Read also:A Hillary Clinton-Elizabeth Warren pairing would be profoundly unusual — and not just in national politicsThe startling leadership vacuum in post-Brexit BritainLike On Leadership?

       "      <td>Although some analysts have criticized the focus of Western governments and NGOs on goals such as trying to increase the number of women in parliaments, enhancing women’s representation remains a central objective of many international democracy promotion efforts in the Arab world. But the impacts of these efforts are more complex than they might appear. Lila Abu Lughod’s provocative recent book, “Do Muslim Women Need Saving?” challenges what she refers to as a Western “moral crusade to rescue oppressed Muslim women from their cultures and their religion [that] has swept the public sphere.” She notes that international, and especially U.S., pressure on Muslim governments to improve on certain measures of gender equality could actually undermine the local legitimacy of feminist causes.Is she right? In “Anti-Americanism, Authoritarian Politics, and Attitudes about Women’s Representation: Evidence from a Survey Experiment in Jordan,” an article published by International Studies Quarterly in July, we report on a unique experimental study that examines how U.S. and domestic endorsements of women in politics affect local attitudes about women’s representation in Jordan.We focus on Jordan for several reasons. First, the international community – including the United States – has strongly pressured Jordan to improve women’s representation, including through the adoption of measures such as gender quotas for its elected national parliament and local councils. Although Jordan is a monarchy that is strongly allied with the United States and European countries, it has been subject to the same international democracy promotion efforts pushing for the adoption of gender quotas that have occurred globally. Second, anti-American attitudes are widespread in Jordan, which heightens the possibility that foreign support for women’s representation could engender a local backlash.Our study draws on evidence from a nationally representative survey of the political attitudes of 1,650 adults in Jordan in November 2010. The survey contained a randomized experiment that was designed to help us understand the effects of foreign support for gender equality on local attitudes. The experiment contained three conditions. We first told a group of randomly selected respondents about Jordan’s quota and the support of a U.S. government-funded organization for women’s political participation in Jordan. Then, as a point of comparison, we told a group of randomly selected respondents about Jordan’s quota and the support of some Jordanian imams for women’s political participation. Finally, a control group received only information about Jordan’s quota. After obtaining their experimental treatments, all respondents were asked questions about their support for women’s representation, including women running for parliament and serving as municipal councilors.Our findings about the effects of the endorsements were surprising. Although few respondents expressed trust in the United States, providing them with information about a U.S. organization’s support for Jordan’s gender quota did not depress their support for women’s representation on average when compared to the control group. For example, 64 percent of respondents in the control condition expressed willingness to vote for a woman running for parliament, whereas 66 percent of respondents in the U.S. treatment did so – a small increase that was not statistically significant. Our analysis suggests that this null finding is not driven by respondents’ preexisting beliefs about the endorsers’ support for gender equality, their preexisting trust in the endorsers, or their levels of political knowledge.Moreover, although most respondents expressed trust in local imams, we found that providing them with information about these religious leaders’ support for Jordan’s gender quota did not increase their support for this issue on average. Both local and international reformers often seek out endorsements from trusted religious leaders for their policy goals. It is not clear, however, from this evidence that such strategies will always pay off. For example, an identical 64 percent of respondents in the control and religious endorsement conditions expressed willingness to vote for a woman running for parliament.Finally, our study uncovered some preliminary evidence that both U.S. and religious endorsements reduce support for women’s representation more among women who opposed the monarchy than supported it. That finding holds even though regime opponents and supporters have similar attitudes about gender. To interpret those unexpected findings, we argue that, in autocracies, disposition toward the incumbent regime is an important cleavage that shapes citizens’ receptivity to endorsements. This interpretation dovetails with research by Dan Corstange and Nikolay Marinov that shows how foreign endorsements polarized domestic attitudes in Lebanon.These findings challenge much of the conventional wisdom about international democracy promotion in the Middle East. Some observers after the Arab Spring urged the United States and other foreign actors not to undermine the legitimacy of local reformers’ efforts. According to Al Jazeera’s former director general, Wadah Khanfar, for example, “what is most important about the Arab spring is that it is coming from Arabs themselves.” At least in the case of gender quotas in Jordan, however, the results suggest that foreign endorsements of political reforms will not necessarily delegitimize the cause, even when delivered by American groups that publics might generally distrust. As we note in the article: “If American support has no average negative impact on public attitudes toward women in politics, the net effect of active American efforts to promote women’s representation is more likely to be beneficial.”Sarah Bush is an assistant professor of political science at Temple University and a senior fellow with the Project on Democratic Transitions at the Foreign Policy Research Institute.

       "      <td>CAIRO — After Egyptian women stood shoulder to shoulder with men in the protests that toppled Hosni Mubarak, many looked forward to a role in the revolution’s next steps. But 15 months later, as Egyptians prepare to vote for a new president this week, rights activists complain that women are being excluded from key decisions.“At the time of the revolution, women were needed to fill out the numbers,” said Hoda Badran, head of the Egyptian Feminist Union, which was banned under Mubarak but reinstated last year. “Now, the decision-makers don’t need women, and we’re back to this idea that femininity is inferior and masculinity superior.”Women hold just over 2 percent of the seats in Egypt’s new parliament, down from about 12 percent in the last elections held under Mubarak. The sharp decline followed the elimination of a quota to ensure women’s representation, which had been seen by many as a way to stack the body with members of Mubarak’s political party.Military rulers did not include any women in the committee that wrote constitutional amendments adopted in a nationwide referendum last year. And there are no women among the 13 candidates who will be on the ballot Wednesday, when voting begins in the country’s first post-Mubarak presidential election.Badran and other women’s rights activists are particularly worried that the well-organized Muslim Brotherhood will use its religious and charitable groups to encourage uneducated and poor women to vote for its candidate, Mohammed Morsi. Morsi opposes women being allowed to serve in the presidency. He has called for the implementation of Islamic law and, at campaign rallies, referred to Islam’s holy book, the Koran, as the constitution.To counter the Brotherhood, Badran’s group has hired hundreds of buses to take women to the polls. It is also distributing pamphlets that encourage women to vote for a candidate who respects women, who doesn’t use religion to campaign and who doesn’t lie, Badran said. The group has not endorsed a candidate.Among its Arab neighbors, Egypt boasts some of the strongest legal protections for women. Women here can sue for divorce. They are a significant part of the workforce, and they are not subject to an Islamic dress code. Egyptian women who are married to foreign men can pass on citizenship to their children, unlike in more socially liberal countries such as Lebanon, where they cannot.But the Islamist-dominated parliament is discussing several proposals that could change women’s status here. They include lowering the legal age of marriage for girls from 18 to 13 and revoking divorced mothers’ custody of their boys at age 7 and girls at 9, rather than at 15, a move that would be in accordance with a strict interpretation of Islamic law.The existing rules were projects of Suzanne Mubarak, the former first lady, a strong advocate of laws to protect women and children’s rights. But she was also accused of monopolizing the issue and putting laws on the books that were never implemented, while independent women’s groups were not allowed to flourish.Of all of Egypt’s political blocs the Muslim Brotherhood’s Freedom and Justice Party has the most female lawmakers in parliament, though many women’s rights activists see them as part of a religious organization that traditionally has not allowed women full-fledged membership.Azza el-Garf, a mother of seven and a member of parliament, has come under intense criticism from liberals and women’s right groups for advocating the revisiting of hard-won laws that women had thought were irreversible, such as the right for women to divorce their husbands and the age of marriage.“When creating laws that concern the families, they need to be in line with Islamic law,” Garf said. But she insisted that the nine women elected to Egypt’s new parliament “gave a big push for the image of women in politics.” (Two other women were appointed to parliament, bringing the total to 11.)At a weekend conference in Cairo, presidential hopefuls were invited to speak to thousands of female voters about their agendas and how they related to women’s rights. Only five candidates attended, with most of the leading candidates absent.Ashraf Rasheed, a representative of Amr Moussa, the former Arab League chief and the liberal front-runner, said that if Moussa wins, he will appoint a female vice president. The audience burst into applause, though Rasheed was then asked to explain why Moussa himself had not attended.Ghada Kamal, a young activist who said she was severely beaten and detained by military police during clashes outside the cabinet building this past winter, is more concerned about the loss of the revolution’s focus on dismantling Mubarak’s regime than about women’s rights. And she’s not sure whether she will vote.“The Egyptian woman discovered she is strong, not weak or oppressed as she had imagined, and that she has a very important role to play, just like a man,” Kamal said. “I don’t think anything has changed for women or men in terms of human or social rights. If this had happened, we would have said that the revolution succeeded.”</td>\n",

       "      <td>The news that Canada’s Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has named a gender-balanced cabinet — and one that is more representative along other dimensions, including religion and ability — is refreshing. (The cabinet of his predecessor, Steven Harper, included six women among its 26 members in 2006).Even more encouraging than Trudeau’s leadership on this issue — and his lack of excuses — is his apparent understanding of the need to address inequality. When asked why he named a government comprised of 50 percent women, he said simply, “Because it’s 2015.” As succinct as his response was, it reflects much greater clarity about the problem of inequality — and its solution — than much public discussion on the issue.Scholars who study politics and gender reject conventional wisdom that women’s marginalization from leadership is due to poorer performance or lesser qualifications (women now outnumber men in advanced degrees in the United States, as in conservative Islamic countries), arguing instead that it reflects unfair recruitment practices. In addition to gender-based biases, inequality can also arise from basic social practices, including the tendency to socialize with others of the same gender. Men simply know fewer women and often prefer to work with other males. This observation helps expose the fallacy that gender equality will be easily achieved without institutional solutions like quotas.Unfortunately, debates about gender have also figured prominently in the U.S. presidential primary races, and in troubling ways. Despite the presence of female candidates Hillary Clinton and Carly Fiorina, public debate on and media coverage of the issue are often devoid of an understanding of the mechanisms that create and perpetuate inequality.In a recent article in Governance — currently ungated — I write about issues of women’s access to government resources and the role that often overlooked structural factors play in contributing to this problem. Although my research takes place in two authoritarian countries in North Africa, it highlights why subtle social dynamics can perpetuate women and other minorities’ lack of access to political power, even when social stereotypes and sexism are diminishing in society in general.Drawing on an original survey of 200 Moroccan and Algerian parliamentarians and field research conducted 2006-2007, I investigate the link between parliamentarian gender, quotas, and service provision to women. A form of constituency service, parliamentary clientelism refers to providing help with personal and community problems, including medical services, judicial or bureaucratic corruption, jobs, money or grants, or electricity. Due to high levels of corruption and economic difficulties in many non-democratic settings, elected officials often spend much of their time trying to help citizens with these issues. Yet I find that women are relatively excluded from these informal service networks with parliamentarians, due in part to structural factors. On average, 20-29 percent of requests that Moroccan and Algerian parliamentarians receive are from women. The effects of gender quotas are striking. While electing women increases service responsiveness to females, parliamentarians elected through quotas experience mandates to help women and are more responsive to females than members of either sex elected without quotas.To explain gender gaps in clientelistic services — and to think about why progress toward gender parity in United States and many other relatively egalitarian societies has stalled — I extend Elin Bjarnegård’s (2013) theory of homosocial capital, which she developed to explain male dominance in Thai parliamentary politics. Homosociality refers to friendships, collaborations and other non-romantic relationships with others of the same gender. Bjarnegård argues that, as long as males are numerically dominant in positions of power, they will continue to enjoy advantages accumulating homosocial capital — predictable relationships with individuals who are similar and have resources needed to win elections.According to Bjarnegård, homosocial capital is composed of instrumental and expressive resources. Expressive resources are dispositional similarities which facilitate close, predictable relationships and access to instrumental resources needed to succeed in campaigns.Men and women often prefer friendship and work collaboration with others of the same gender, due to greater ease relating (e.g., similar behavior and interests, fewer conflicts and sexual harassment concerns, higher trust). Male dominance is reproduced because instrumental and expressive resources are seldom in opposition for men. Males have more instrumental resources and can rely on homosocial linkages. In contrast, women must foster heterosocial networks to obtain resources, while enjoying less expressive resources, such as trust and familiarity, in networks with men.I extend Bjarnegård’s theory of homosocial capital accumulation by incorporating structural and normative aspects of patriarchy into the framework and identifying two gender gaps: in parliamentarians’ supply of and citizens’ demand for services. Patriarchal structures are formal laws and policies such as personal status (e.g., marriage, divorce, inheritance, mobility) and employment laws (e.g., wage discrimination, sex segregation) which give males more instrumental resources and reproduce stereotypes about women’s traits and abilities (i.e., what women are like and can do), including their ability to provide wasta (use of a connection to gets things one needs). Patriarchal norms and attitudes are traditional views of gender roles which identify public space as male, discourage mixing of unrelated males and females, and justify gender discrimination (i.e., what women should do).Exclusion of women from service provision occurs through mutually-reinforcing structural and dispositional factors operating on the supply and demand-side of exchanges. On the instrumental, supply-side, patriarchal structures limit female deputies’ instrumental resources needed to provide services. Because female leaders enjoy fewer patronage networks, women are less likely to be seen as good wastas and are less able to run and succeed in elections (see Table 1).In Tunisia, 19.1 percent saw male deputies as better service providers, compared to 6.9 percent who saw women as better (73.9 percent believed there was no difference), according to a 2014 Transitional Governance Project survey of 1200 Tunisians conducted by United Nations Democracy Fund and Centre d’Études Maghrébines à Tunis, in collaboration with Lindsay Benstead, Ellen Lust, Dhafer Malouche and JMW Consulting.In Jordan, 45.4 percent saw males as better, compared to 13.5 percent females (41.1 percent, no difference), according to a 2014 Program on Governance and Local Development poll conducted among 1,488 Jordanians by Lindsay Benstead, Kristen Kao and Ellen Lust.In Libya, 28.2 percent believed a man would be more effective, compared to 10.9 percent women (60.9 percent, no difference), according to a 2013 National Democratic Institute poll of 1200 Libyans conducted by Diwan Research and the Transitional Governance Project, in collaboration with Lindsay Benstead, Ellen Lust, and JMW Consulting.Table 1. Mechanisms of exclusion from service provisionOn the instrumental, demand side, patriarchal structures exclude women from public space (e.g., employment, politics), giving them fewer resources and influence. Women are less likely to be civically engaged or lead civil society groups, Sufi brotherhoods, and tribes — groups which are critical for winning semi-competitive elections.The Transitional Governance Project found voting in first post-uprisings parliamentary elections was 77 percent for Egyptian men, 58 percent for women; 75 percent for Tunisian men, 65 percent for women; and, 84 percent for Libyan men, 59 percent for women.

       "      <td>In becoming Britain’s second female prime minister, Theresa May has made the country just the sixth in Europe (and 17th in the world) to have had more than one female leader.May, like her female predecessor Margaret Thatcher, is a Conservative. Her party’s main rival, the Labour Party, has had a parade of white male leaders. Although Margaret Beckett and Harriet Harman served as interim Labour Party leaders, neither was elected to that post.Which party has better female representation: Conservative or Labour?So is the Conservative Party beating Labour 2 to 0 in representing women in politics, as former prime minister David Cameron quipped in his final Prime Minister’s Questions? Is it true that the Conservative Party, as Boris Johnson said last week, is “the most progressive party in Britain” when it comes to representing women? No, in at least two important ways.First, on the benches of the House of Commons, only 21 percent of Conservative Party MPs are women — less than half that of the Labour Party, whose MPS are now 43 percent women. In fact, for almost two decades, Labour has consistently had about twice the proportion of women as has the Conservative Party, as the graph below shows.Second, unlike the Conservatives, Labour has consistently used robust policies in selecting candidates to guarantee healthy female representation on their slate.Here’s how Britain’s Labour Party boosted female representation in Parliament More than 100 political parties around the world — including Labour — use what are called “gender quota.” Labour’s gender quota policy, called all-women shortlists, was first used for the 1997 election. It commits the party to considering only female candidates in at least half of all “winnable” seats that come open.The policy’s results were dramatic. That year, the proportion of women in the Parliamentary Labour Party went from 14 percent to 24 percent, and the number of women in parliament overall doubled from 60 to 120. Labour has continued to use all-women shortlists in selecting its candidates for general elections ever since, with one exception. During the 2001 election, a legal challenge made the practice illegal. But a Labour-dominated Parliament amended the Equality Act to accommodate the provision.Here’s how the British Conservative Party tried to boost female representation in Parliament By contrast, the Conservative Party’s attempts to increase the number of female MPs have been significantly less effective. From the mid-2000s, Conservative gender-equality activists pressured party leaders to pay more attention to the underrepresentation of women. May, now prime minister, co-founded one key effort: Women2win, an organization to encourage and support women entering into Conservative Party politics. As Sarah Childs, Paul Webb and Sally Marthaler argued in the journal Political Quarterly, these efforts were important in changing party attitudes.In fact, after being selected party leader in 2005, David Cameron spent much of his acceptance speech promising that the party will “change the scandalous under-representation of women in the Conservative Party.” Within the year, the party introduced what it called priority candidate list — or the “A-List,” of about 150 aspiring candidates, from which local party organizers were encouraged to select. The party promised that the A-List would be at least 50 percent women and that a “significant” proportion would be nonwhite, and also introduced rules for gender-balanced shortlisting during the candidate-selection process.In Political Quarterly, Rosie Campbell, Joni Lovenduski and Childs argued that Cameron’s increased emphasis on getting more women into Parliament was an important evolution of the Conservative Party, raising awareness within the party of the need to “modernize” and appeal to female voters. But relatively few local party constituencies (equivalent to, in the United States, a district party organization) selected women from the A-List, and it was abandoned altogether in 2012. While Conservative Party leaders encouraged them to voluntarily select all-female shortlists themselves, no local party chose to do so. Although more Conservative women were elected in 2010, they still made up only a modest 16 percent of Conservative MPs, a bit more than half of Labour’s 31 percent.So what kinds of policies actually lead to gender equality in politics? Lovenduski in her book “Feminizing Politics” puts attempts to tackle women’s political underrepresentation into three categories: equality rhetoric, equality promotion and equality guarantees. While the Conservative Party in the past decade has had plenty of equality rhetoric and promotion — which Lovenduski considers important steps toward “feminizing politics” — it has stopped short of guaranteeing equality. Labour, by contrast, took steps to guarantee equal representation. Political scientists, such as Mona Lena Krook, have consistently found that robust equality guarantees in the form of gender quotas are the surest route to increasing women’s representation at all levels in politics. The results can be counted.Of course, only the Conservative Party has put women into the top spotIt’s true that the Conservative Party has now put women in the most exceptional position in Britain: that of prime minister. But it has not gone far in diversifying its gender composition. As Diana O’Brien and Karen Beckwith wrote here earlier this week, both Thatcher and May came to power after political crises, which is often the way women become political leaders. That might soon happen in the Labour Party as well; if Angela Eagle succeeds in challenging Jeremy Corbyn for leader, she too may take over at a time of organizational disaster.In other words, even women’s rise to the top of the party may not indicate a commitment to institutional change; rather, it’s a product of political convenience and circumstance.Nugent is a PhD candidate at Rutgers University at New Brunswick, studying women and politics.

       "      <td>On Sunday, Ecuadorians head to the polls to elect legislators as well as a replacement for the thrice-elected President Rafael Correa, the longest-serving chief executive in the country’s history. Along with policy changes, the country may see some shifts in the proportion of female legislators.Here’s what you need to know about Ecuador’s presidential and legislative elections, where voting is mandatory:1) There are 8 presidential candidates The last official survey results, released Feb. 8 before a government-imposed media blackout, showed a tight race. Front-runners are the ruling Alianza PAIS (AP) candidate, Lenín Moreno, who served as vice president from 2007 to 2013; and the Creando Oportunidades (CREO) movement’s Guillermo Lasso, a conservative former economy minister and banker who was a distant presidential runner-up in 2013.The Feb. 8 survey of decided and undecided voters gave Moreno 32 percent of likely votes versus 21 percent for Lasso, and 14 percent for former congresswoman Cynthia Viteri. The center-left ex-mayor of Quito, Paco Moncayo, has just 8 percent support, and the four other candidates representing minor parties are polling at 4 percent or less for each. Nearly 12 percent of respondents would cast a null vote to reject the field.However, a whopping 35 percent of these voters are undecided, meaning more than a third of Ecuadorians are not wedded to a single candidate, adding a high degree of uncertainty to Sunday’s proceedings. 2) This is what Ecuador’s electoral system looks likeEcuador uses a two-round voting system for its presidential election. To win outright and avoid a runoff election, presidential candidates need to get 40 percent of the vote and hold at least a 10 percent advantage over the nearest rival in the first round. The poll numbers suggest no candidate will win outright, however.It seems likely that Moreno will end up in an April 2 runoff with Lasso or Viteri. Given political polarization in the country, the opposition hopes that anti-government sentiment will push voters to coalesce around a single candidate.Ecuadorians will also cast National Assembly votes this Sunday, using the rare free list electoral system, which is somewhat like an extreme version of open lists. Some countries elect their parliaments or congresses using an open list, which lets voters choose among candidates on the list. Others use a closed electoral list, where voters vote for the party itself, rather than individual candidates.Ecuador’s system, however, allows voters to choose individuals not only within party lists, but among different parties as well. In other words, voters may choose an entire slate of candidates from their party — as in a closed-list system — or cast individual nominal votes among the candidates.3) How have rules and voter behavior boosted representation by women? In 2015, Ecuador boasted the third-highest percentage of female legislators in Latin America (53 of 137 assembly members, or 39 percent of its unicameral legislature), behind only Bolivia (53 percent) and Nicaragua (40 percent). Just 25 years earlier, women failed to exceed even 7 percent of Ecuador’s legislature.Many of these great strides reflect Ecuador’s legislative efforts on gender representation. In 1997, lawmakers introduced a 20 percent quota on party lists, which would increase by 5 percent for each election cycle until parity was achieved.This law was replaced by Articles 99(1) and 160 of the 2009 Electoral Law, which establish a 50 percent quota — parity — and the alternation of male and female candidates on proportional representation candidate lists, known as the “zipper method.” This means if a party won four seats in a district, for instance, it would be represented in Congress by two male and two female legislators. 4) How might the unusual voting system affect women’s representation in 2017?In a working project, Tom Mustillo of Purdue University and I found that, buoyed by Correa’s strong presidential coattails and high public approval, AP voters tend to use the party-list option under the free list. But opposition voters tend to cast individual votes across party lines.The effects on women’s representation are noticeable. Of the 53 female legislators elected in 2013, 46 were Alianza PAIS candidates, and only 7 came from other parties. In fact, as Figure 1 shows, 46 percent of AP legislators were women, compared with just 19 percent of opposition legislators.AP voters may be more enlightened with regard to gender than are voters at large. But it’s likely that the way voters use the free-list system affects the effectiveness of laws enacted to create gender quotas. Without Correa at the helm of AP, will voters shy away from party lists? If so, the percentage of female legislators will most certainly fall in 2017.5) What is Ecuador’s ‘muerte cruzada,’ and how might this affect stability?Correa boasted a majority government for a large chunk of his presidency, the first president to do so since Ecuador’s return to democracy in 1979. Dogged by corruption allegations surrounding the government, AP isn’t likely to earn a majority in the next National Assembly. With their weak organization and national penetration, the opposition parties are even less likely to do so.This matters a great deal to Ecuador’s political stability. Under a weaker government, the muerte cruzada (“mutual death”) provision in Article 148 of the 2008 constitution gives the president the option to dissolve the National Assembly — and simultaneously cut short his own term. The government would then call for new legislative and presidential elections, with the incumbent allowed to govern by decree on urgent economic matters in the interim.Muerte cruzada was never a legitimate threat in the latter years of Correa’s presidency. However, this constitutional feature dramatically increases the risks that a divided or minority government might end in deadlock and dissolution.This could lead to frequent elections and changes of government, as in the decade from 1996 to 2006, when no elected Ecuadorian president served out a full term. It could also increase the temptation for presidents to dissolve parliament so that they can govern unilaterally during the undefined interim period before new elections can be held.Rafael Correa has dominated Ecuador’s politics since 2007 through good politicking, populist policymaking and closing channels of dissent, as well as a political context he helped shape with a new constitution. While Ecuador has made great strides in women’s representation and enjoyed a decade of political stability, Sunday’s election may mark a step backward.

       "      <td>The news that Canada’s Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has named a gender-balanced cabinet — and one that is more representative along other dimensions, including religion and ability — is refreshing. (The cabinet of his predecessor, Steven Harper, included six women among its 26 members in 2006).Even more encouraging than Trudeau’s leadership on this issue — and his lack of excuses — is his apparent understanding of the need to address inequality. When asked why he named a government comprised of 50 percent women, he said simply, “Because it’s 2015.” As succinct as his response was, it reflects much greater clarity about the problem of inequality — and its solution — than much public discussion on the issue.Scholars who study politics and gender reject conventional wisdom that women’s marginalization from leadership is due to poorer performance or lesser qualifications (women now outnumber men in advanced degrees in the United States, as in conservative Islamic countries), arguing instead that it reflects unfair recruitment practices. In addition to gender-based biases, inequality can also arise from basic social practices, including the tendency to socialize with others of the same gender. Men simply know fewer women and often prefer to work with other males. This observation helps expose the fallacy that gender equality will be easily achieved without institutional solutions like quotas.Unfortunately, debates about gender have also figured prominently in the U.S. presidential primary races, and in troubling ways. Despite the presence of female candidates Hillary Clinton and Carly Fiorina, public debate on and media coverage of the issue are often devoid of an understanding of the mechanisms that create and perpetuate inequality.In a recent article in Governance — currently ungated — I write about issues of women’s access to government resources and the role that often overlooked structural factors play in contributing to this problem. Although my research takes place in two authoritarian countries in North Africa, it highlights why subtle social dynamics can perpetuate women and other minorities’ lack of access to political power, even when social stereotypes and sexism are diminishing in society in general.Drawing on an original survey of 200 Moroccan and Algerian parliamentarians and field research conducted 2006-2007, I investigate the link between parliamentarian gender, quotas, and service provision to women. A form of constituency service, parliamentary clientelism refers to providing help with personal and community problems, including medical services, judicial or bureaucratic corruption, jobs, money or grants, or electricity. Due to high levels of corruption and economic difficulties in many non-democratic settings, elected officials often spend much of their time trying to help citizens with these issues. Yet I find that women are relatively excluded from these informal service networks with parliamentarians, due in part to structural factors. On average, 20-29 percent of requests that Moroccan and Algerian parliamentarians receive are from women. The effects of gender quotas are striking. While electing women increases service responsiveness to females, parliamentarians elected through quotas experience mandates to help women and are more responsive to females than members of either sex elected without quotas.To explain gender gaps in clientelistic services — and to think about why progress toward gender parity in United States and many other relatively egalitarian societies has stalled — I extend Elin Bjarnegård’s (2013) theory of homosocial capital, which she developed to explain male dominance in Thai parliamentary politics. Homosociality refers to friendships, collaborations and other non-romantic relationships with others of the same gender. Bjarnegård argues that, as long as males are numerically dominant in positions of power, they will continue to enjoy advantages accumulating homosocial capital — predictable relationships with individuals who are similar and have resources needed to win elections.According to Bjarnegård, homosocial capital is composed of instrumental and expressive resources. Expressive resources are dispositional similarities which facilitate close, predictable relationships and access to instrumental resources needed to succeed in campaigns.Men and women often prefer friendship and work collaboration with others of the same gender, due to greater ease relating (e.g., similar behavior and interests, fewer conflicts and sexual harassment concerns, higher trust). Male dominance is reproduced because instrumental and expressive resources are seldom in opposition for men. Males have more instrumental resources and can rely on homosocial linkages. In contrast, women must foster heterosocial networks to obtain resources, while enjoying less expressive resources, such as trust and familiarity, in networks with men.I extend Bjarnegård’s theory of homosocial capital accumulation by incorporating structural and normative aspects of patriarchy into the framework and identifying two gender gaps: in parliamentarians’ supply of and citizens’ demand for services. Patriarchal structures are formal laws and policies such as personal status (e.g., marriage, divorce, inheritance, mobility) and employment laws (e.g., wage discrimination, sex segregation) which give males more instrumental resources and reproduce stereotypes about women’s traits and abilities (i.e., what women are like and can do), including their ability to provide wasta (use of a connection to gets things one needs). Patriarchal norms and attitudes are traditional views of gender roles which identify public space as male, discourage mixing of unrelated males and females, and justify gender discrimination (i.e., what women should do).Exclusion of women from service provision occurs through mutually-reinforcing structural and dispositional factors operating on the supply and demand-side of exchanges. On the instrumental, supply-side, patriarchal structures limit female deputies’ instrumental resources needed to provide services. Because female leaders enjoy fewer patronage networks, women are less likely to be seen as good wastas and are less able to run and succeed in elections (see Table 1).In Tunisia, 19.1 percent saw male deputies as better service providers, compared to 6.9 percent who saw women as better (73.9 percent believed there was no difference), according to a 2014 Transitional Governance Project survey of 1200 Tunisians conducted by United Nations Democracy Fund and Centre d’Études Maghrébines à Tunis, in collaboration with Lindsay Benstead, Ellen Lust, Dhafer Malouche and JMW Consulting.In Jordan, 45.4 percent saw males as better, compared to 13.5 percent females (41.1 percent, no difference), according to a 2014 Program on Governance and Local Development poll conducted among 1,488 Jordanians by Lindsay Benstead, Kristen Kao and Ellen Lust.In Libya, 28.2 percent believed a man would be more effective, compared to 10.9 percent women (60.9 percent, no difference), according to a 2013 National Democratic Institute poll of 1200 Libyans conducted by Diwan Research and the Transitional Governance Project, in collaboration with Lindsay Benstead, Ellen Lust, and JMW Consulting.Table 1. Mechanisms of exclusion from service provisionOn the instrumental, demand side, patriarchal structures exclude women from public space (e.g., employment, politics), giving them fewer resources and influence. Women are less likely to be civically engaged or lead civil society groups, Sufi brotherhoods, and tribes — groups which are critical for winning semi-competitive elections.The Transitional Governance Project found voting in first post-uprisings parliamentary elections was 77 percent for Egyptian men, 58 percent for women; 75 percent for Tunisian men, 65 percent for women; and, 84 percent for Libyan men, 59 percent for women.

       "      <td>Kim Yi Dionne: This post is the second in a three-part series on gender and politics focused on political leadership. The series highlights recent political science scholarship that examines experiences from around the world. An earlier post by Farida Jalalzai discussed global trends of women achieving executive office and a forthcoming post by Jana Morgan will discuss women’s leadership in Latin America. Today’s post is a contribution from Leonardo Arriola, Associate Professor of Political Science at UC Berkeley and Martha Johnson, Assistant Professor of Political Science at Mills College. Arriola and Johnson share insights from their recently published article in the American Journal of Political Science: “Ethnic Politics and Women’s Empowerment in Africa: Ministerial Appointments to Executive Cabinets.”****Women in African countries have considerably expanded their participation in political power over the past three decades. Current presidents like Joyce Banda of Malawi, Ellen Johnson Sirleaf of Liberia, and Catherine Samba-Panza of Central African Republic offer visible proof of women’s increasing presence in African executive authority. The emergence of these women leaders reflects a broader regional trend. Since 1980, the proportion of women appointed as cabinet ministers in African countries has increased from 4 percent to 20 percent, placing the region second in the world just behind the Americas and ahead of Europe. Whereas only one-third of African countries had a woman cabinet minister in 1980, today women are included in the cabinet of every African country. But the growth of women in African governance has not necessarily translated into real influence. Previous scholarship has shown that women around the world typically receive appointments to less prestigious, more “feminine,” ministerial portfolios like women’s affairs, which are rarely launching pads for greater authority. This remains true in much of Africa. Based on data from 43 African countries between 1980 and 2005, we find that women are significantly less likely than men to receive high prestige appointments in areas such as finance or defense. Women are more likely to be found in medium prestige portfolios like education, which may have sizable personnel and resources but little influence, or low prestige portfolios like culture with small budgets and narrow constituencies.Prevailing cabinet appointment patterns among African governments have tended to limit the influence of women in high politics. Women are more likely than men to get stuck in less prestigious cabinet positions. As Figure 1 illustrates, men and women have contrasting tenure patterns: men spend more time in more powerful positions whereas women spend more time in less powerful positions. This is problematic because appointments to low prestige portfolios are cabinet dead-ends for most politicians, since they are typically shuffled out of the government without being elevated to more powerful positions. This is especially true for women: while 12.06 percent of men who start in low or medium prestige portfolios are promoted to high prestige portfolios, only 5.74 percent of women have experienced similar promotions.Despite their growing numbers in African governments, women continue to have limited policy influence because they tend to be concentrated in a single area of government. Figure 2 shows the functional classification of 9,824 portfolio appointments held by men and women across 43 African countries between 1980 and 2005. Whereas men tend to be broadly distributed across functional areas, more than half of all women (53.95 percent) are appointed to portfolios that concern government’s social welfare functions in areas like education, family affairs, community development, and culture. Only one-fifth of men (20.82 percent) are appointed to such portfolios. These proportions nearly flip among portfolios that oversee economic functions such as agriculture, lands, and public works with only 22.87 percent of women receiving such appointments versus 43.09 percent of men. Why do women continue to be appointed to less influential positions in African governments? Previous studies of government formation in advanced democracies suggest that women tend to lose out on powerful portfolios where such appointments are used to forge coalitions among party leaders, who are primarily men. We believe a similar dynamic holds in African countries. Despite the ongoing process of democratization, incumbent presidents use high prestige appointments to win the support of influential politicians who, because of their sizable ethnic or regional constituencies, can potentially pose a threat to the executive’s continued hold on power. Women are rarely in such positions in African countries.African leaders may instead appoint women to their cabinets to signal their intent to deliver on campaign promises. Ongoing democratization has created greater pressure for the region’s governments to deliver on reform and improved governance. Some leaders have responded by appointing women to their cabinets with reputations built through work in activist movements, professional associations, and non-governmental organizations. For example, in Uganda, women’s rights activist Miria Matembe, an outspoken critic of corruption, was appointed to lead the Ministry for Ethics and Integrity. In this respect, the entry of women policy advocates in African governments conforms to a broader cross-national pattern in which women with policy or professional expertise are more likely to be appointed to the cabinet.African women’s executive influence will ultimately depend on the emergence of women who possess both the political capital to negotiate high prestige appointments and exceptional qualifications in related policy areas. Although existing patronage channels connected to state agencies and ruling parties remain dominated by men, growing opportunities in the private sector and international organizations may enable women to acquire expertise and influence in a wide range of policy areas, making them attractive candidates for the highest levels of government. In Nigeria, for example, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, was twice appointed finance minister after having gaining experience as an economist and vice-president working for the World Bank. Her path, like that of Africa’s three women presidents and the other women ministers we have studied, demonstrates that African women are using professional training, career excellence, and outspoken activism to make ever larger cracks in the glass ceilings of executive power. In the process, many women ministers are pushing for a new model of African governance, one that is more professional, transparent, and responsive to women’s needs and concerns.</td>\n",

       "      <td>The United States has plummeted to 28th place on an annual ranking of the world's most equal countries for men and women, falling behind Rwanda, an East African country ravaged by genocide in 1994.Rwandan women beat American women in both labor force participation and government representation, according to the World Economic Forum’s Global Gender Gap Report. Eighty-eight percent of women in Rwanda have jobs, compared to 66 percent of women in the U.S. A whopping 64 percent of the African nation’s politicians are women, compared to our 19 percent.It's important to note that Rwanda, which placed sixth on the list, also boasts more gender equality than France (15th), Spain (25th), Germany (11th), Switzerland (8th) and Denmark (14th). Each country was graded on labor participation, health, political empowerment and educational attainment.So, how did Rwanda blaze past much of the Western world in women’s economic and political opportunity? The answer lies in recent history.The Rwandan genocide, a mass slaughter of the Tutsi minority population, tore apart families and killed roughly 800,000 adults and children in 100 days. Hutu extremists destroyed communities, raping an estimated 500,000 women.After the tragedy ended in July 1994, women banded together and demanded power. They changed the country’s constitution to require that women hold at least 30 percent of top political roles. They called for true equality in marriage. They took over farms. They delayed starting families to work and earn more.In a story for The Guardian last year, reporter Alexandra Topping, who visited Kigali, the country’s capital, wrote: “A swath of laws have given women the right to inherit land, share the assets of a marriage and obtain credit. As many girls as boys receive primary and secondary education, maternal mortality is lower and the birth rate is falling.”Things, of course, aren’t perfect. Topping notes that domestic violence still plagues households, despite public campaigns to stop it. And average lifespans in Rwanda remain low, the WEF report highlighted: 57 years old for women and 55 for men.The U.S., meanwhile, plunged eight slots on the gender equality ranking this year, slipping out of the report’s top 20. The wage gap and fewer women in senior government positions appear to have propelled the drop.Beyond discrimination, economists say both issues are exacerbated by America's lack of family-friendly policies, the soaring cost of child care and the cultural expectation that women, even sole breadwinners, should shoulder the bulk of domestic responsibilities. A recent Pew survey of more than 1,800 U.S. parents found both men and women have trouble balancing job responsibilities with family life. Mothers, however, reported tackling more chores than fathers, regardless of who earned more money: Sixty-four percent of female respondents said the majority of household work fell to them.American women also experienced an uneven recovery since the last economic downtown, which dragged down their labor force participation.About 8.7 million jobs disappeared during the last recession. American men have encountered less trouble getting back to work, according to the Economic Policy Institute. Between February 2010 and June 2014, they gained 5.5 million jobs, while women gained 3.6 million.Related:How American women fell behind Japanese women in the workplaceBoston is offering free salary negotiation workshops to every woman who works in the city</td>\n",

       "40    A record-breaking number of women were elected to the British Parliament in Thursday’s election, with many calling it a “historic” moment. When legislators return to Westminster next week, there will be 208 women among their ranks, or 32 percent of Parliament. The majority of the parties are also led by women. In fact, Prime Minister Theresa May is now negotiating with another woman, Arlene Foster of Northern Ireland’s Democratic Unionist Party, to form a government.But is this election really a turning point for women in the United Kingdom?Despite the headlines, these results represent only an incremental change — a gain of just 12 more seats for women. And although women might be better represented in Parliament than in the U.S. Congress, the United Kingdom still lags behind most European and Latin American democracies. Thursday’s election moved it from 46 to 39 in the global rankings. Focusing on the headline number also obscures significant variation across parties and regions.The parties aren’t alikeAs with the Democrats in the United States, women’s representation is highest in the center-left Labour Party. Women hold 45 percent of Labour seats (119 of 262) compared with 21 percent of Conservative seats. In fact, the number of women parliamentarians in the Conservative Party actually decreased from 70 to 67 in this election.The difference between the parties is because of a strategy — “all-women shortlists” — adopted by the Labour Party in 1994. Labour requires that half of all winnable seats be contested by female candidates. When it was partially implemented for the first time in 1997, women’s numbers grew from 37 to 101. Since being fully implemented from 2005 onwards, women’s representation has never fallen below 27 percent.Scotland is different, tooThere is also variation within the U.K. itself. Women’s representation actually decreased in Scotland. This is in large part because of the Conservative gains in the region: among the thirteen returning members of Parliament, only one is a woman. And this is despite the striking prominence of women in Scottish politics, where the leaders of the three major parties are all women, and First Minister Nicola Sturgeon appointed a gender-balanced Cabinet.The U.K. isn’t close to gender parityThe U.K. remains a long way from gender parity in Parliament. To get there, the Conservatives will have to increase the number of female candidates competing in winnable seats. They’ve tried to bolster women’s numbers before through “soft” measures — such as the Women2Win initiative co-founded by Theresa May to support and train Conservative women, and the gender balanced “priority list” of prospective candidates that local parties were encouraged to select from (although it proved unpopular and was soon abandoned).Despite acknowledging the need for more women in politics, the Conservative Party remains opposed to a strategy like all-women shortlists. Their resistance is not surprising. While there are right-leaning parties in Western Europe with voluntary quotas (including the German Christian Democrats and Austrian People’s Party), no conservative party in the region has been willing to implement this strategy.Moreover, Britain, unlike more than 75 countries across the globe, has not adopted legislation that mandates the selection or election of female candidates for office. A growing number of European countries have done so, including France in 1999, Ireland in 2012 and Poland in 2011.What comes next? One crucial issue on the agenda: women’s reproductive rights. The governing coalition will likely include the Conservative Party and Northern Ireland’s Democratic Unionist Party, and the DUP has consistently campaigned to limit abortion rights. The DUP’s former health minister, Jim Wells, has even argued against abortion in cases of rape. Newly elected MP Owen Paterson confirmed in an interview yesterday that abortion restrictions might be up for debate.At the same time, May’s position is precarious, and many observers do not expect this fragile coalition to last long. If new elections are on the horizon, then we will soon see whether there will be further increases in women’s representation — and if so, what that means for public policy.Mary Nugent is a PhD candidate in political science at Rutgers University.

       "121   When I went to Uganda in 1992, I was interested in understanding why the country had so many women in top government positions and why it had the highest rates of representation of women in parliament in Africa at the time. During my research, I realized that a key reason was war. Uganda had just emerged from years of major conflict. Relations between women and men had begun to change, and as a result, women started to mobilize for their rights.Over time, it became evident that post-conflict countries had considerably higher rates of female political representation than countries that had not suffered through violence. Post-conflict Liberia was the first African country to elect a woman president. As early as 1994, post-conflict Uganda already had a woman vice president for 10 years. Post-conflict Rwanda today has the highest rate of female legislative representation in the world – 63.8 percent of its legislators are women – and has held that spot since 2003.My latest book, “Women and Power in Postconflict Africa” (Cambridge University Press 2015), shows how the trends I observed in Uganda in the early 1990s became evident in many of the 16 other African countries that came out of conflict, especially after 2000. Across Africa, countries emerging from major conflict were quicker to advance women’s rights and elect women to political office than countries that had remained less conflicted. What is more, post-conflict nations went further in changing their laws and constitutions, offering women more strong legal protections in the areas of land rights, family law, violence and political equality.And it is not just in Africa. We see more women in office after conflict around the world, in such places as Slovenia, Nepal and East Timor.This post-1990s pattern echoes earlier transformations in women’s citizenship, when World War I shook up gender norms across Europe and the United States. Women mobilized for the vote in many countries for decades, but it was only after the war that they finally gained suffrage.The book is based both on extensive fieldwork in Uganda, Liberia and Angola, and on in-depth analysis that compares post-conflict and non-conflict countries across Africa. It also builds on a longitudinal study that I carried out with Melanie Hughes, in which we found statistical evidence of the relationship between women’s legislative representation and the end of major wars that were particularly long or had very high rates of conflict-related deaths.Advancing women’s rights is an unexpected byproduct of warThe Nordic countries took more than 100 years to get equal numbers of women and men in their legislatures. After civil wars, some African countries exceeded their rates almost overnight.None of this, however, happened before the 1990s, a time when women’s rights activists had made gains in legal reform in many African countries and pressured United Nations agencies, foreign donors and international organizations to promote those rights worldwide.Of course, women’s rights activists in post-conflict countries say that the changes have been all too slow and halting. But even the impatience with the the pace of change tells us how much expectations have been transformed. In nondemocratic countries such as Angola, Chad and Eritrea, we see fewer changes, in part because citizens have few political rights and civil liberties.But looking at the big picture in a country like Uganda, we see new women leaders in business, civil society, academia, religious institutions and a host of institutions in which they had previously been invisible. We also see changes in attitudes toward women and women’s leadership. In some countries the changes were more extensive than others, where sometimes one saw change only along a few dimensions.In Angola, for example, women increased their numbers in the legislature but won fewer legal and constitutional rights. But that is, in part, because Angola is not a democracy, and so women were not able to create organizations independent of the government and other dominant political powers. Creating a women’s rights agenda requires women to build coalitions across parties, ethnicities and other identities and affiliations – which can then make demands of the ruling party.Why did post-conflict countries advance women’s status so quickly? Here is why. During conflicts, women are pushed into new roles in the economy, in their households and communities and even in national politics. While some women also fought, others became active in peace movements, which have often been led by women or involved large numbers of women – and then use the transition to peace as a time to demand equality.In Africa, for instance, women were among those most engaged in behind-the-scenes peacemaking, pressuring militia to lay down their arms, demonstrating for peaceful elections and negotiating the release of kidnapped civilians. Further, women gain credibility after these conflicts, since they have been political outsiders, uninvolved with leading the militias and paramilitaries and not responsible for the violence – making a vote for a woman seen as a break with the disastrously violent status quo.From these positions, women often try to influence peace negotiations to include women’s rights planks into the peace accords. The results include quotas for women on candidate slates; explicit listing of sexual violence as a war crime during transitional justice processes, and requirements to include women at the table where new constitutions are being written. Sometimes international donors and other international actors supported and pressured for these results.Some kinds of conflict produced more advances in women’s rights than others While no one would ever advocate war as a route to advancing women, my research showed that the longer or more deadly the war, the more advances women make. That is, in part, because when society is seriously ruptured by war, it is easier to persuade people to adopt new norms, institutions and include new political actors.Further, after a civil war, women’s rights had a better chance of improving if the conflict ended with peace negotiations rather than a decisive victory for one side, as happened in Angola and Sri Lanka. Women and international non-governmental organizations had less power to add women’s rights to the laws and constitutions if one dominant side simply took power than if they were at the table while peace was negotiated and constitutions were rewritten.Finally, women made more advances after major civil wars or wars of national liberation than after interstate or proxy wars, or after low-level conflict, local rebellions or coups d’état. For instance, consider the ongoing conflict in Somalia. There is not enough stability for leaders to worry about legislative reform – and so we should not expect much legal change with respect to women’s status during conflict.Aili Mari Tripp is a professor of political science and gender and women’s studies at the University of Wisconsin at Madison.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",
       "276   Western European countries have long led the world on gender equality, but the latest annual Gender Gap Report, just issued by the World Economic Forum, shows that the U.S. is making significant gains in an area where it has often lagged the Western world.The annual WEF report grades countries on five metrics to measure the degree of gender equality or inequality: economic participation and opportunity, educational attainment, health and survival, and political empowerment. Countries are scored between 0.0 for most unequal, meaning that women have zero access, or 1.0 for fully equal.The 2012 report ranks the U.S. 22nd in the world. The only non-Western nations that rank higher than the U.S., meaning their societies are more equal for women, are South Africa, Cuba, Lesotho, Nicaragua, and the Philippines. American society has been catching up to its historical leaders, as this chart of WEF gender equality scores across Western Europe since 2006 shows.I haven't included Scandinavian countries in this chart. Their scores are so high that it would make it to difficult to portray the U.S.'s relative gains against the rest of Western Europe. But what's also striking about this is the relatively poor gender equality in two of Western Europe's largest economies and more liberal societies: France and Italy.In the broader European context, the U.S. is in fact a better place for women, judging by the WEF data, than is the majority of the continent. Here's a map of Europe, color-coded by gender equality. The blue countries are, according to the WEF data, more accessible societies for women than is the United States, with darker blue signifying better scores. The red countries are less friendly societies for women, with darker red signifying worse scores.This map tells a few different stories. The first is the striking degrees of inequality that remain in Western Europe. In the cases of Spain and France, that has worsened considerably over recent years. The second is the remarkable successes that women have found in Scandinavian countries, by far the most equal for women in the world. And perhaps the third would be the deep problems of gender inequality that persist in much of the former Soviet Union. I'll be looking more into several of these issues throughout the day, so check back.

       "528   On election night in November, many cheered a relative milestone: For the first time ever, there would be more than 100 women in the U.S. Congress. Yet while that may be a record high, it doesn't look as impressive when compared with other high-income nations — or even many lower-income ones.The Pew Research Center released a data analysis Monday of a 2014 World Economic Forum report on the gender gap. The analysis examined how the U.S. compares to other countries when it comes to having women in top government posts, and the results aren't reassuring.Among 49 \"high income\" countries, the United States ranks 33rd when it comes to women in legislative roles. Sweden was first. Meanwhile, among a larger group of 137 countries, it came in 83rd. Pew notes that the WEF data is from May 2014, but that even if numbers from the current Congress were analyzed, the United States would still come in just 75th.America did better in other categories, but still fell behind many of its peers. Among high-income countries, it tied with Canada for 12th place on the share of Cabinet-level positions held by women. Among all countries, it was 25th. In this case, however, Pew found that the ratio of U.S. Cabinet positions held by women has actually gone down since the WEF's report, which presumably would mean the U.S. ranking could be even lower.One category in which the United States fared better was that of \"legislators, senior officials and managers.\" It tied for fourth place among high-income countries — with Barbados and Trinidad and Tobago — in this ranking that measures women's representation across multiple leadership positions including corporate managers, legislators, top political party officials and nonprofit leaders. (When the larger group of countries was analyzed, it was tied for 16th with Namibia.)What's holding women back in the United States? Pew addressed that question as part of its Women and Leadership survey, the first in a series of reports about the topic, of which this analysis is a part. In the survey, 38 percent of respondents said more women did not reach higher political office because they are held to higher standards, while 37 percent thought it was because others weren't ready to elect them. Just 17 percent attributed the low numbers to women's family responsibilities, and 27 percent to a lack of support from political parties.Read also:More than 100 women in Congress for the first time—and not much growthBecky Hammon's path to the NBALike On Leadership?

       "1073  It's still months until September, when Britain's next prime minister will be named, and November, when the United States will elect its next president. But the political turmoil that's erupted following Britain's vote to leave the European Union has put in place the possibility of a profoundly historic moment: By next January, women could lead the three largest Western economies.Yes, it's early, and yes, it's still totally speculative. But the possibility that women could lead the United States, Britain and Germany at the same time is also a very real one. Angela Merkel's term as chancellor of Germany is not up until the fall of 2017, when the country will hold its next election. Hillary Clinton is poised to become the first female nominee of a major U.S. political party, and she is currently leading in many polls against Donald Trump, the presumptive GOP nominee.And with the decision by former London Mayor Boris Johnson not to run to be the Conservative Party's next leader -- who will replace David Cameron in September as Britain's prime minister -- Home Secretary Theresa May has vaulted into the lead as the favorite among British oddsmakers. Meanwhile, a YouGov/Times poll also put her in the lead, though it did not include Michael Gove, the justice secretary who had repeatedly said he didn't want the job but shocked Britain Thursday with the announcement that he did.\"This is not crazy stuff -- it's a moment to take note of,\" said Debbie Walsh, director of the Center for American Women in Politics at Rutgers University. \"Even the fact, honestly, that two women are among the two leading candidates [in the U.S. and Britain] -- that it could even possibly happen -- is in and of itself historic. It’s really extraordinary. There’s never been anything like that before, where it was even in the realm of possibility, let alone happen.\" Britain, of course, has had a female prime minister before: Margaret Thatcher served from 1979 to 1990. Merkel is Germany's first female chancellor, a position she has held since 2005. The United States, meanwhile, has never had a female nominee from a major political party.May voted to remain in the European Union, though she is noted to have done so \"gently,\" keeping a low profile and still finding fans among \"Euroskeptics\" for her immigration policies. That position could make her less attractive as the person to negotiate Britain's exit -- or it could make her be seen as more of a unifier, a role she is casting herself in. \"That's nice middle ground at a moment when Great Britain is quite at odds with itself about this decision,\" Walsh said.Then there is also Marine Le Pen, who leads the far right National Front party in France. The next French presidential election will be in the spring of 2017, which the Post's Michael Birnbaum writes \"appears ripe for an insurgent candidate such as Le Pen,\" particularly after the recent Brexit vote. He reports that while she leads many polls for France's crowded first round of voting, she falls behind Hollande in the second, head-to-head vote.If in fact there do end up being two, or three, or even more women around the table at the next G-8 Summit, Walsh says that image could radically reshuffle how we view the opportunity for getting women into global leadership roles. \"It could disrupt our image of who world leaders can be,\" she said, \"and would do so at a very, very high level.\"Read also:A Hillary Clinton-Elizabeth Warren pairing would be profoundly unusual — and not just in national politicsThe startling leadership vacuum in post-Brexit BritainLike On Leadership?

       "3881  Although some analysts have criticized the focus of Western governments and NGOs on goals such as trying to increase the number of women in parliaments, enhancing women’s representation remains a central objective of many international democracy promotion efforts in the Arab world. But the impacts of these efforts are more complex than they might appear. Lila Abu Lughod’s provocative recent book, “Do Muslim Women Need Saving?” challenges what she refers to as a Western “moral crusade to rescue oppressed Muslim women from their cultures and their religion [that] has swept the public sphere.” She notes that international, and especially U.S., pressure on Muslim governments to improve on certain measures of gender equality could actually undermine the local legitimacy of feminist causes.Is she right? In “Anti-Americanism, Authoritarian Politics, and Attitudes about Women’s Representation: Evidence from a Survey Experiment in Jordan,” an article published by International Studies Quarterly in July, we report on a unique experimental study that examines how U.S. and domestic endorsements of women in politics affect local attitudes about women’s representation in Jordan.We focus on Jordan for several reasons. First, the international community – including the United States – has strongly pressured Jordan to improve women’s representation, including through the adoption of measures such as gender quotas for its elected national parliament and local councils. Although Jordan is a monarchy that is strongly allied with the United States and European countries, it has been subject to the same international democracy promotion efforts pushing for the adoption of gender quotas that have occurred globally. Second, anti-American attitudes are widespread in Jordan, which heightens the possibility that foreign support for women’s representation could engender a local backlash.Our study draws on evidence from a nationally representative survey of the political attitudes of 1,650 adults in Jordan in November 2010. The survey contained a randomized experiment that was designed to help us understand the effects of foreign support for gender equality on local attitudes. The experiment contained three conditions. We first told a group of randomly selected respondents about Jordan’s quota and the support of a U.S. government-funded organization for women’s political participation in Jordan. Then, as a point of comparison, we told a group of randomly selected respondents about Jordan’s quota and the support of some Jordanian imams for women’s political participation. Finally, a control group received only information about Jordan’s quota. After obtaining their experimental treatments, all respondents were asked questions about their support for women’s representation, including women running for parliament and serving as municipal councilors.Our findings about the effects of the endorsements were surprising. Although few respondents expressed trust in the United States, providing them with information about a U.S. organization’s support for Jordan’s gender quota did not depress their support for women’s representation on average when compared to the control group. For example, 64 percent of respondents in the control condition expressed willingness to vote for a woman running for parliament, whereas 66 percent of respondents in the U.S. treatment did so – a small increase that was not statistically significant. Our analysis suggests that this null finding is not driven by respondents’ preexisting beliefs about the endorsers’ support for gender equality, their preexisting trust in the endorsers, or their levels of political knowledge.Moreover, although most respondents expressed trust in local imams, we found that providing them with information about these religious leaders’ support for Jordan’s gender quota did not increase their support for this issue on average. Both local and international reformers often seek out endorsements from trusted religious leaders for their policy goals. It is not clear, however, from this evidence that such strategies will always pay off. For example, an identical 64 percent of respondents in the control and religious endorsement conditions expressed willingness to vote for a woman running for parliament.Finally, our study uncovered some preliminary evidence that both U.S. and religious endorsements reduce support for women’s representation more among women who opposed the monarchy than supported it. That finding holds even though regime opponents and supporters have similar attitudes about gender. To interpret those unexpected findings, we argue that, in autocracies, disposition toward the incumbent regime is an important cleavage that shapes citizens’ receptivity to endorsements. This interpretation dovetails with research by Dan Corstange and Nikolay Marinov that shows how foreign endorsements polarized domestic attitudes in Lebanon.These findings challenge much of the conventional wisdom about international democracy promotion in the Middle East. Some observers after the Arab Spring urged the United States and other foreign actors not to undermine the legitimacy of local reformers’ efforts. According to Al Jazeera’s former director general, Wadah Khanfar, for example, “what is most important about the Arab spring is that it is coming from Arabs themselves.” At least in the case of gender quotas in Jordan, however, the results suggest that foreign endorsements of political reforms will not necessarily delegitimize the cause, even when delivered by American groups that publics might generally distrust. As we note in the article: “If American support has no average negative impact on public attitudes toward women in politics, the net effect of active American efforts to promote women’s representation is more likely to be beneficial.”Sarah Bush is an assistant professor of political science at Temple University and a senior fellow with the Project on Democratic Transitions at the Foreign Policy Research Institute.

       "3956  CAIRO — After Egyptian women stood shoulder to shoulder with men in the protests that toppled Hosni Mubarak, many looked forward to a role in the revolution’s next steps. But 15 months later, as Egyptians prepare to vote for a new president this week, rights activists complain that women are being excluded from key decisions.“At the time of the revolution, women were needed to fill out the numbers,” said Hoda Badran, head of the Egyptian Feminist Union, which was banned under Mubarak but reinstated last year. “Now, the decision-makers don’t need women, and we’re back to this idea that femininity is inferior and masculinity superior.”Women hold just over 2 percent of the seats in Egypt’s new parliament, down from about 12 percent in the last elections held under Mubarak. The sharp decline followed the elimination of a quota to ensure women’s representation, which had been seen by many as a way to stack the body with members of Mubarak’s political party.Military rulers did not include any women in the committee that wrote constitutional amendments adopted in a nationwide referendum last year. And there are no women among the 13 candidates who will be on the ballot Wednesday, when voting begins in the country’s first post-Mubarak presidential election.Badran and other women’s rights activists are particularly worried that the well-organized Muslim Brotherhood will use its religious and charitable groups to encourage uneducated and poor women to vote for its candidate, Mohammed Morsi. Morsi opposes women being allowed to serve in the presidency. He has called for the implementation of Islamic law and, at campaign rallies, referred to Islam’s holy book, the Koran, as the constitution.To counter the Brotherhood, Badran’s group has hired hundreds of buses to take women to the polls. It is also distributing pamphlets that encourage women to vote for a candidate who respects women, who doesn’t use religion to campaign and who doesn’t lie, Badran said. The group has not endorsed a candidate.Among its Arab neighbors, Egypt boasts some of the strongest legal protections for women. Women here can sue for divorce. They are a significant part of the workforce, and they are not subject to an Islamic dress code. Egyptian women who are married to foreign men can pass on citizenship to their children, unlike in more socially liberal countries such as Lebanon, where they cannot.But the Islamist-dominated parliament is discussing several proposals that could change women’s status here. They include lowering the legal age of marriage for girls from 18 to 13 and revoking divorced mothers’ custody of their boys at age 7 and girls at 9, rather than at 15, a move that would be in accordance with a strict interpretation of Islamic law.The existing rules were projects of Suzanne Mubarak, the former first lady, a strong advocate of laws to protect women and children’s rights. But she was also accused of monopolizing the issue and putting laws on the books that were never implemented, while independent women’s groups were not allowed to flourish.Of all of Egypt’s political blocs the Muslim Brotherhood’s Freedom and Justice Party has the most female lawmakers in parliament, though many women’s rights activists see them as part of a religious organization that traditionally has not allowed women full-fledged membership.Azza el-Garf, a mother of seven and a member of parliament, has come under intense criticism from liberals and women’s right groups for advocating the revisiting of hard-won laws that women had thought were irreversible, such as the right for women to divorce their husbands and the age of marriage.“When creating laws that concern the families, they need to be in line with Islamic law,” Garf said. But she insisted that the nine women elected to Egypt’s new parliament “gave a big push for the image of women in politics.” (Two other women were appointed to parliament, bringing the total to 11.)At a weekend conference in Cairo, presidential hopefuls were invited to speak to thousands of female voters about their agendas and how they related to women’s rights. Only five candidates attended, with most of the leading candidates absent.Ashraf Rasheed, a representative of Amr Moussa, the former Arab League chief and the liberal front-runner, said that if Moussa wins, he will appoint a female vice president. The audience burst into applause, though Rasheed was then asked to explain why Moussa himself had not attended.Ghada Kamal, a young activist who said she was severely beaten and detained by military police during clashes outside the cabinet building this past winter, is more concerned about the loss of the revolution’s focus on dismantling Mubarak’s regime than about women’s rights. And she’s not sure whether she will vote.“The Egyptian woman discovered she is strong, not weak or oppressed as she had imagined, and that she has a very important role to play, just like a man,” Kamal said. “I don’t think anything has changed for women or men in terms of human or social rights. If this had happened, we would have said that the revolution succeeded.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
       "4870  The news that Canada’s Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has named a gender-balanced cabinet — and one that is more representative along other dimensions, including religion and ability — is refreshing. (The cabinet of his predecessor, Steven Harper, included six women among its 26 members in 2006).Even more encouraging than Trudeau’s leadership on this issue — and his lack of excuses — is his apparent understanding of the need to address inequality. When asked why he named a government comprised of 50 percent women, he said simply, “Because it’s 2015.” As succinct as his response was, it reflects much greater clarity about the problem of inequality — and its solution — than much public discussion on the issue.Scholars who study politics and gender reject conventional wisdom that women’s marginalization from leadership is due to poorer performance or lesser qualifications (women now outnumber men in advanced degrees in the United States, as in conservative Islamic countries), arguing instead that it reflects unfair recruitment practices. In addition to gender-based biases, inequality can also arise from basic social practices, including the tendency to socialize with others of the same gender. Men simply know fewer women and often prefer to work with other males. This observation helps expose the fallacy that gender equality will be easily achieved without institutional solutions like quotas.Unfortunately, debates about gender have also figured prominently in the U.S. presidential primary races, and in troubling ways. Despite the presence of female candidates Hillary Clinton and Carly Fiorina, public debate on and media coverage of the issue are often devoid of an understanding of the mechanisms that create and perpetuate inequality.In a recent article in Governance — currently ungated — I write about issues of women’s access to government resources and the role that often overlooked structural factors play in contributing to this problem. Although my research takes place in two authoritarian countries in North Africa, it highlights why subtle social dynamics can perpetuate women and other minorities’ lack of access to political power, even when social stereotypes and sexism are diminishing in society in general.Drawing on an original survey of 200 Moroccan and Algerian parliamentarians and field research conducted 2006-2007, I investigate the link between parliamentarian gender, quotas, and service provision to women. A form of constituency service, parliamentary clientelism refers to providing help with personal and community problems, including medical services, judicial or bureaucratic corruption, jobs, money or grants, or electricity. Due to high levels of corruption and economic difficulties in many non-democratic settings, elected officials often spend much of their time trying to help citizens with these issues. Yet I find that women are relatively excluded from these informal service networks with parliamentarians, due in part to structural factors. On average, 20-29 percent of requests that Moroccan and Algerian parliamentarians receive are from women. The effects of gender quotas are striking. While electing women increases service responsiveness to females, parliamentarians elected through quotas experience mandates to help women and are more responsive to females than members of either sex elected without quotas.To explain gender gaps in clientelistic services — and to think about why progress toward gender parity in United States and many other relatively egalitarian societies has stalled — I extend Elin Bjarnegård’s (2013) theory of homosocial capital, which she developed to explain male dominance in Thai parliamentary politics. Homosociality refers to friendships, collaborations and other non-romantic relationships with others of the same gender. Bjarnegård argues that, as long as males are numerically dominant in positions of power, they will continue to enjoy advantages accumulating homosocial capital — predictable relationships with individuals who are similar and have resources needed to win elections.According to Bjarnegård, homosocial capital is composed of instrumental and expressive resources. Expressive resources are dispositional similarities which facilitate close, predictable relationships and access to instrumental resources needed to succeed in campaigns.Men and women often prefer friendship and work collaboration with others of the same gender, due to greater ease relating (e.g., similar behavior and interests, fewer conflicts and sexual harassment concerns, higher trust). Male dominance is reproduced because instrumental and expressive resources are seldom in opposition for men. Males have more instrumental resources and can rely on homosocial linkages. In contrast, women must foster heterosocial networks to obtain resources, while enjoying less expressive resources, such as trust and familiarity, in networks with men.I extend Bjarnegård’s theory of homosocial capital accumulation by incorporating structural and normative aspects of patriarchy into the framework and identifying two gender gaps: in parliamentarians’ supply of and citizens’ demand for services. Patriarchal structures are formal laws and policies such as personal status (e.g., marriage, divorce, inheritance, mobility) and employment laws (e.g., wage discrimination, sex segregation) which give males more instrumental resources and reproduce stereotypes about women’s traits and abilities (i.e., what women are like and can do), including their ability to provide wasta (use of a connection to gets things one needs). Patriarchal norms and attitudes are traditional views of gender roles which identify public space as male, discourage mixing of unrelated males and females, and justify gender discrimination (i.e., what women should do).Exclusion of women from service provision occurs through mutually-reinforcing structural and dispositional factors operating on the supply and demand-side of exchanges. On the instrumental, supply-side, patriarchal structures limit female deputies’ instrumental resources needed to provide services. Because female leaders enjoy fewer patronage networks, women are less likely to be seen as good wastas and are less able to run and succeed in elections (see Table 1).In Tunisia, 19.1 percent saw male deputies as better service providers, compared to 6.9 percent who saw women as better (73.9 percent believed there was no difference), according to a 2014 Transitional Governance Project survey of 1200 Tunisians conducted by United Nations Democracy Fund and Centre d’Études Maghrébines à Tunis, in collaboration with Lindsay Benstead, Ellen Lust, Dhafer Malouche and JMW Consulting.In Jordan, 45.4 percent saw males as better, compared to 13.5 percent females (41.1 percent, no difference), according to a 2014 Program on Governance and Local Development poll conducted among 1,488 Jordanians by Lindsay Benstead, Kristen Kao and Ellen Lust.In Libya, 28.2 percent believed a man would be more effective, compared to 10.9 percent women (60.9 percent, no difference), according to a 2013 National Democratic Institute poll of 1200 Libyans conducted by Diwan Research and the Transitional Governance Project, in collaboration with Lindsay Benstead, Ellen Lust, and JMW Consulting.Table 1. Mechanisms of exclusion from service provisionOn the instrumental, demand side, patriarchal structures exclude women from public space (e.g., employment, politics), giving them fewer resources and influence. Women are less likely to be civically engaged or lead civil society groups, Sufi brotherhoods, and tribes — groups which are critical for winning semi-competitive elections.The Transitional Governance Project found voting in first post-uprisings parliamentary elections was 77 percent for Egyptian men, 58 percent for women; 75 percent for Tunisian men, 65 percent for women; and, 84 percent for Libyan men, 59 percent for women.

       "4892  In becoming Britain’s second female prime minister, Theresa May has made the country just the sixth in Europe (and 17th in the world) to have had more than one female leader.May, like her female predecessor Margaret Thatcher, is a Conservative. Her party’s main rival, the Labour Party, has had a parade of white male leaders. Although Margaret Beckett and Harriet Harman served as interim Labour Party leaders, neither was elected to that post.Which party has better female representation: Conservative or Labour?So is the Conservative Party beating Labour 2 to 0 in representing women in politics, as former prime minister David Cameron quipped in his final Prime Minister’s Questions? Is it true that the Conservative Party, as Boris Johnson said last week, is “the most progressive party in Britain” when it comes to representing women? No, in at least two important ways.First, on the benches of the House of Commons, only 21 percent of Conservative Party MPs are women — less than half that of the Labour Party, whose MPS are now 43 percent women. In fact, for almost two decades, Labour has consistently had about twice the proportion of women as has the Conservative Party, as the graph below shows.Second, unlike the Conservatives, Labour has consistently used robust policies in selecting candidates to guarantee healthy female representation on their slate.Here’s how Britain’s Labour Party boosted female representation in Parliament More than 100 political parties around the world — including Labour — use what are called “gender quota.” Labour’s gender quota policy, called all-women shortlists, was first used for the 1997 election. It commits the party to considering only female candidates in at least half of all “winnable” seats that come open.The policy’s results were dramatic. That year, the proportion of women in the Parliamentary Labour Party went from 14 percent to 24 percent, and the number of women in parliament overall doubled from 60 to 120. Labour has continued to use all-women shortlists in selecting its candidates for general elections ever since, with one exception. During the 2001 election, a legal challenge made the practice illegal. But a Labour-dominated Parliament amended the Equality Act to accommodate the provision.Here’s how the British Conservative Party tried to boost female representation in Parliament By contrast, the Conservative Party’s attempts to increase the number of female MPs have been significantly less effective. From the mid-2000s, Conservative gender-equality activists pressured party leaders to pay more attention to the underrepresentation of women. May, now prime minister, co-founded one key effort: Women2win, an organization to encourage and support women entering into Conservative Party politics. As Sarah Childs, Paul Webb and Sally Marthaler argued in the journal Political Quarterly, these efforts were important in changing party attitudes.In fact, after being selected party leader in 2005, David Cameron spent much of his acceptance speech promising that the party will “change the scandalous under-representation of women in the Conservative Party.” Within the year, the party introduced what it called priority candidate list — or the “A-List,” of about 150 aspiring candidates, from which local party organizers were encouraged to select. The party promised that the A-List would be at least 50 percent women and that a “significant” proportion would be nonwhite, and also introduced rules for gender-balanced shortlisting during the candidate-selection process.In Political Quarterly, Rosie Campbell, Joni Lovenduski and Childs argued that Cameron’s increased emphasis on getting more women into Parliament was an important evolution of the Conservative Party, raising awareness within the party of the need to “modernize” and appeal to female voters. But relatively few local party constituencies (equivalent to, in the United States, a district party organization) selected women from the A-List, and it was abandoned altogether in 2012. While Conservative Party leaders encouraged them to voluntarily select all-female shortlists themselves, no local party chose to do so. Although more Conservative women were elected in 2010, they still made up only a modest 16 percent of Conservative MPs, a bit more than half of Labour’s 31 percent.So what kinds of policies actually lead to gender equality in politics? Lovenduski in her book “Feminizing Politics” puts attempts to tackle women’s political underrepresentation into three categories: equality rhetoric, equality promotion and equality guarantees. While the Conservative Party in the past decade has had plenty of equality rhetoric and promotion — which Lovenduski considers important steps toward “feminizing politics” — it has stopped short of guaranteeing equality. Labour, by contrast, took steps to guarantee equal representation. Political scientists, such as Mona Lena Krook, have consistently found that robust equality guarantees in the form of gender quotas are the surest route to increasing women’s representation at all levels in politics. The results can be counted.Of course, only the Conservative Party has put women into the top spotIt’s true that the Conservative Party has now put women in the most exceptional position in Britain: that of prime minister. But it has not gone far in diversifying its gender composition. As Diana O’Brien and Karen Beckwith wrote here earlier this week, both Thatcher and May came to power after political crises, which is often the way women become political leaders. That might soon happen in the Labour Party as well; if Angela Eagle succeeds in challenging Jeremy Corbyn for leader, she too may take over at a time of organizational disaster.In other words, even women’s rise to the top of the party may not indicate a commitment to institutional change; rather, it’s a product of political convenience and circumstance.Nugent is a PhD candidate at Rutgers University at New Brunswick, studying women and politics.

       "6078  On Sunday, Ecuadorians head to the polls to elect legislators as well as a replacement for the thrice-elected President Rafael Correa, the longest-serving chief executive in the country’s history. Along with policy changes, the country may see some shifts in the proportion of female legislators.Here’s what you need to know about Ecuador’s presidential and legislative elections, where voting is mandatory:1) There are 8 presidential candidates The last official survey results, released Feb. 8 before a government-imposed media blackout, showed a tight race. Front-runners are the ruling Alianza PAIS (AP) candidate, Lenín Moreno, who served as vice president from 2007 to 2013; and the Creando Oportunidades (CREO) movement’s Guillermo Lasso, a conservative former economy minister and banker who was a distant presidential runner-up in 2013.The Feb. 8 survey of decided and undecided voters gave Moreno 32 percent of likely votes versus 21 percent for Lasso, and 14 percent for former congresswoman Cynthia Viteri. The center-left ex-mayor of Quito, Paco Moncayo, has just 8 percent support, and the four other candidates representing minor parties are polling at 4 percent or less for each. Nearly 12 percent of respondents would cast a null vote to reject the field.However, a whopping 35 percent of these voters are undecided, meaning more than a third of Ecuadorians are not wedded to a single candidate, adding a high degree of uncertainty to Sunday’s proceedings. 2) This is what Ecuador’s electoral system looks likeEcuador uses a two-round voting system for its presidential election. To win outright and avoid a runoff election, presidential candidates need to get 40 percent of the vote and hold at least a 10 percent advantage over the nearest rival in the first round. The poll numbers suggest no candidate will win outright, however.It seems likely that Moreno will end up in an April 2 runoff with Lasso or Viteri. Given political polarization in the country, the opposition hopes that anti-government sentiment will push voters to coalesce around a single candidate.Ecuadorians will also cast National Assembly votes this Sunday, using the rare free list electoral system, which is somewhat like an extreme version of open lists. Some countries elect their parliaments or congresses using an open list, which lets voters choose among candidates on the list. Others use a closed electoral list, where voters vote for the party itself, rather than individual candidates.Ecuador’s system, however, allows voters to choose individuals not only within party lists, but among different parties as well. In other words, voters may choose an entire slate of candidates from their party — as in a closed-list system — or cast individual nominal votes among the candidates.3) How have rules and voter behavior boosted representation by women? In 2015, Ecuador boasted the third-highest percentage of female legislators in Latin America (53 of 137 assembly members, or 39 percent of its unicameral legislature), behind only Bolivia (53 percent) and Nicaragua (40 percent). Just 25 years earlier, women failed to exceed even 7 percent of Ecuador’s legislature.Many of these great strides reflect Ecuador’s legislative efforts on gender representation. In 1997, lawmakers introduced a 20 percent quota on party lists, which would increase by 5 percent for each election cycle until parity was achieved.This law was replaced by Articles 99(1) and 160 of the 2009 Electoral Law, which establish a 50 percent quota — parity — and the alternation of male and female candidates on proportional representation candidate lists, known as the “zipper method.” This means if a party won four seats in a district, for instance, it would be represented in Congress by two male and two female legislators. 4) How might the unusual voting system affect women’s representation in 2017?In a working project, Tom Mustillo of Purdue University and I found that, buoyed by Correa’s strong presidential coattails and high public approval, AP voters tend to use the party-list option under the free list. But opposition voters tend to cast individual votes across party lines.The effects on women’s representation are noticeable. Of the 53 female legislators elected in 2013, 46 were Alianza PAIS candidates, and only 7 came from other parties. In fact, as Figure 1 shows, 46 percent of AP legislators were women, compared with just 19 percent of opposition legislators.AP voters may be more enlightened with regard to gender than are voters at large. But it’s likely that the way voters use the free-list system affects the effectiveness of laws enacted to create gender quotas. Without Correa at the helm of AP, will voters shy away from party lists? If so, the percentage of female legislators will most certainly fall in 2017.5) What is Ecuador’s ‘muerte cruzada,’ and how might this affect stability?Correa boasted a majority government for a large chunk of his presidency, the first president to do so since Ecuador’s return to democracy in 1979. Dogged by corruption allegations surrounding the government, AP isn’t likely to earn a majority in the next National Assembly. With their weak organization and national penetration, the opposition parties are even less likely to do so.This matters a great deal to Ecuador’s political stability. Under a weaker government, the muerte cruzada (“mutual death”) provision in Article 148 of the 2008 constitution gives the president the option to dissolve the National Assembly — and simultaneously cut short his own term. The government would then call for new legislative and presidential elections, with the incumbent allowed to govern by decree on urgent economic matters in the interim.Muerte cruzada was never a legitimate threat in the latter years of Correa’s presidency. However, this constitutional feature dramatically increases the risks that a divided or minority government might end in deadlock and dissolution.This could lead to frequent elections and changes of government, as in the decade from 1996 to 2006, when no elected Ecuadorian president served out a full term. It could also increase the temptation for presidents to dissolve parliament so that they can govern unilaterally during the undefined interim period before new elections can be held.Rafael Correa has dominated Ecuador’s politics since 2007 through good politicking, populist policymaking and closing channels of dissent, as well as a political context he helped shape with a new constitution. While Ecuador has made great strides in women’s representation and enjoyed a decade of political stability, Sunday’s election may mark a step backward.

       "6473  The news that Canada’s Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has named a gender-balanced cabinet — and one that is more representative along other dimensions, including religion and ability — is refreshing. (The cabinet of his predecessor, Steven Harper, included six women among its 26 members in 2006).Even more encouraging than Trudeau’s leadership on this issue — and his lack of excuses — is his apparent understanding of the need to address inequality. When asked why he named a government comprised of 50 percent women, he said simply, “Because it’s 2015.” As succinct as his response was, it reflects much greater clarity about the problem of inequality — and its solution — than much public discussion on the issue.Scholars who study politics and gender reject conventional wisdom that women’s marginalization from leadership is due to poorer performance or lesser qualifications (women now outnumber men in advanced degrees in the United States, as in conservative Islamic countries), arguing instead that it reflects unfair recruitment practices. In addition to gender-based biases, inequality can also arise from basic social practices, including the tendency to socialize with others of the same gender. Men simply know fewer women and often prefer to work with other males. This observation helps expose the fallacy that gender equality will be easily achieved without institutional solutions like quotas.Unfortunately, debates about gender have also figured prominently in the U.S. presidential primary races, and in troubling ways. Despite the presence of female candidates Hillary Clinton and Carly Fiorina, public debate on and media coverage of the issue are often devoid of an understanding of the mechanisms that create and perpetuate inequality.In a recent article in Governance — currently ungated — I write about issues of women’s access to government resources and the role that often overlooked structural factors play in contributing to this problem. Although my research takes place in two authoritarian countries in North Africa, it highlights why subtle social dynamics can perpetuate women and other minorities’ lack of access to political power, even when social stereotypes and sexism are diminishing in society in general.Drawing on an original survey of 200 Moroccan and Algerian parliamentarians and field research conducted 2006-2007, I investigate the link between parliamentarian gender, quotas, and service provision to women. A form of constituency service, parliamentary clientelism refers to providing help with personal and community problems, including medical services, judicial or bureaucratic corruption, jobs, money or grants, or electricity. Due to high levels of corruption and economic difficulties in many non-democratic settings, elected officials often spend much of their time trying to help citizens with these issues. Yet I find that women are relatively excluded from these informal service networks with parliamentarians, due in part to structural factors. On average, 20-29 percent of requests that Moroccan and Algerian parliamentarians receive are from women. The effects of gender quotas are striking. While electing women increases service responsiveness to females, parliamentarians elected through quotas experience mandates to help women and are more responsive to females than members of either sex elected without quotas.To explain gender gaps in clientelistic services — and to think about why progress toward gender parity in United States and many other relatively egalitarian societies has stalled — I extend Elin Bjarnegård’s (2013) theory of homosocial capital, which she developed to explain male dominance in Thai parliamentary politics. Homosociality refers to friendships, collaborations and other non-romantic relationships with others of the same gender. Bjarnegård argues that, as long as males are numerically dominant in positions of power, they will continue to enjoy advantages accumulating homosocial capital — predictable relationships with individuals who are similar and have resources needed to win elections.According to Bjarnegård, homosocial capital is composed of instrumental and expressive resources. Expressive resources are dispositional similarities which facilitate close, predictable relationships and access to instrumental resources needed to succeed in campaigns.Men and women often prefer friendship and work collaboration with others of the same gender, due to greater ease relating (e.g., similar behavior and interests, fewer conflicts and sexual harassment concerns, higher trust). Male dominance is reproduced because instrumental and expressive resources are seldom in opposition for men. Males have more instrumental resources and can rely on homosocial linkages. In contrast, women must foster heterosocial networks to obtain resources, while enjoying less expressive resources, such as trust and familiarity, in networks with men.I extend Bjarnegård’s theory of homosocial capital accumulation by incorporating structural and normative aspects of patriarchy into the framework and identifying two gender gaps: in parliamentarians’ supply of and citizens’ demand for services. Patriarchal structures are formal laws and policies such as personal status (e.g., marriage, divorce, inheritance, mobility) and employment laws (e.g., wage discrimination, sex segregation) which give males more instrumental resources and reproduce stereotypes about women’s traits and abilities (i.e., what women are like and can do), including their ability to provide wasta (use of a connection to gets things one needs). Patriarchal norms and attitudes are traditional views of gender roles which identify public space as male, discourage mixing of unrelated males and females, and justify gender discrimination (i.e., what women should do).Exclusion of women from service provision occurs through mutually-reinforcing structural and dispositional factors operating on the supply and demand-side of exchanges. On the instrumental, supply-side, patriarchal structures limit female deputies’ instrumental resources needed to provide services. Because female leaders enjoy fewer patronage networks, women are less likely to be seen as good wastas and are less able to run and succeed in elections (see Table 1).In Tunisia, 19.1 percent saw male deputies as better service providers, compared to 6.9 percent who saw women as better (73.9 percent believed there was no difference), according to a 2014 Transitional Governance Project survey of 1200 Tunisians conducted by United Nations Democracy Fund and Centre d’Études Maghrébines à Tunis, in collaboration with Lindsay Benstead, Ellen Lust, Dhafer Malouche and JMW Consulting.In Jordan, 45.4 percent saw males as better, compared to 13.5 percent females (41.1 percent, no difference), according to a 2014 Program on Governance and Local Development poll conducted among 1,488 Jordanians by Lindsay Benstead, Kristen Kao and Ellen Lust.In Libya, 28.2 percent believed a man would be more effective, compared to 10.9 percent women (60.9 percent, no difference), according to a 2013 National Democratic Institute poll of 1200 Libyans conducted by Diwan Research and the Transitional Governance Project, in collaboration with Lindsay Benstead, Ellen Lust, and JMW Consulting.Table 1. Mechanisms of exclusion from service provisionOn the instrumental, demand side, patriarchal structures exclude women from public space (e.g., employment, politics), giving them fewer resources and influence. Women are less likely to be civically engaged or lead civil society groups, Sufi brotherhoods, and tribes — groups which are critical for winning semi-competitive elections.The Transitional Governance Project found voting in first post-uprisings parliamentary elections was 77 percent for Egyptian men, 58 percent for women; 75 percent for Tunisian men, 65 percent for women; and, 84 percent for Libyan men, 59 percent for women.

       "6478  Kim Yi Dionne: This post is the second in a three-part series on gender and politics focused on political leadership. The series highlights recent political science scholarship that examines experiences from around the world. An earlier post by Farida Jalalzai discussed global trends of women achieving executive office and a forthcoming post by Jana Morgan will discuss women’s leadership in Latin America. Today’s post is a contribution from Leonardo Arriola, Associate Professor of Political Science at UC Berkeley and Martha Johnson, Assistant Professor of Political Science at Mills College. Arriola and Johnson share insights from their recently published article in the American Journal of Political Science: “Ethnic Politics and Women’s Empowerment in Africa: Ministerial Appointments to Executive Cabinets.”****Women in African countries have considerably expanded their participation in political power over the past three decades. Current presidents like Joyce Banda of Malawi, Ellen Johnson Sirleaf of Liberia, and Catherine Samba-Panza of Central African Republic offer visible proof of women’s increasing presence in African executive authority. The emergence of these women leaders reflects a broader regional trend. Since 1980, the proportion of women appointed as cabinet ministers in African countries has increased from 4 percent to 20 percent, placing the region second in the world just behind the Americas and ahead of Europe. Whereas only one-third of African countries had a woman cabinet minister in 1980, today women are included in the cabinet of every African country. But the growth of women in African governance has not necessarily translated into real influence. Previous scholarship has shown that women around the world typically receive appointments to less prestigious, more “feminine,” ministerial portfolios like women’s affairs, which are rarely launching pads for greater authority. This remains true in much of Africa. Based on data from 43 African countries between 1980 and 2005, we find that women are significantly less likely than men to receive high prestige appointments in areas such as finance or defense. Women are more likely to be found in medium prestige portfolios like education, which may have sizable personnel and resources but little influence, or low prestige portfolios like culture with small budgets and narrow constituencies.Prevailing cabinet appointment patterns among African governments have tended to limit the influence of women in high politics. Women are more likely than men to get stuck in less prestigious cabinet positions. As Figure 1 illustrates, men and women have contrasting tenure patterns: men spend more time in more powerful positions whereas women spend more time in less powerful positions. This is problematic because appointments to low prestige portfolios are cabinet dead-ends for most politicians, since they are typically shuffled out of the government without being elevated to more powerful positions. This is especially true for women: while 12.06 percent of men who start in low or medium prestige portfolios are promoted to high prestige portfolios, only 5.74 percent of women have experienced similar promotions.Despite their growing numbers in African governments, women continue to have limited policy influence because they tend to be concentrated in a single area of government. Figure 2 shows the functional classification of 9,824 portfolio appointments held by men and women across 43 African countries between 1980 and 2005. Whereas men tend to be broadly distributed across functional areas, more than half of all women (53.95 percent) are appointed to portfolios that concern government’s social welfare functions in areas like education, family affairs, community development, and culture. Only one-fifth of men (20.82 percent) are appointed to such portfolios. These proportions nearly flip among portfolios that oversee economic functions such as agriculture, lands, and public works with only 22.87 percent of women receiving such appointments versus 43.09 percent of men. Why do women continue to be appointed to less influential positions in African governments? Previous studies of government formation in advanced democracies suggest that women tend to lose out on powerful portfolios where such appointments are used to forge coalitions among party leaders, who are primarily men. We believe a similar dynamic holds in African countries. Despite the ongoing process of democratization, incumbent presidents use high prestige appointments to win the support of influential politicians who, because of their sizable ethnic or regional constituencies, can potentially pose a threat to the executive’s continued hold on power. Women are rarely in such positions in African countries.African leaders may instead appoint women to their cabinets to signal their intent to deliver on campaign promises. Ongoing democratization has created greater pressure for the region’s governments to deliver on reform and improved governance. Some leaders have responded by appointing women to their cabinets with reputations built through work in activist movements, professional associations, and non-governmental organizations. For example, in Uganda, women’s rights activist Miria Matembe, an outspoken critic of corruption, was appointed to lead the Ministry for Ethics and Integrity. In this respect, the entry of women policy advocates in African governments conforms to a broader cross-national pattern in which women with policy or professional expertise are more likely to be appointed to the cabinet.African women’s executive influence will ultimately depend on the emergence of women who possess both the political capital to negotiate high prestige appointments and exceptional qualifications in related policy areas. Although existing patronage channels connected to state agencies and ruling parties remain dominated by men, growing opportunities in the private sector and international organizations may enable women to acquire expertise and influence in a wide range of policy areas, making them attractive candidates for the highest levels of government. In Nigeria, for example, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, was twice appointed finance minister after having gaining experience as an economist and vice-president working for the World Bank. Her path, like that of Africa’s three women presidents and the other women ministers we have studied, demonstrates that African women are using professional training, career excellence, and outspoken activism to make ever larger cracks in the glass ceilings of executive power. In the process, many women ministers are pushing for a new model of African governance, one that is more professional, transparent, and responsive to women’s needs and concerns.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",
       "7047  The United States has plummeted to 28th place on an annual ranking of the world's most equal countries for men and women, falling behind Rwanda, an East African country ravaged by genocide in 1994.Rwandan women beat American women in both labor force participation and government representation, according to the World Economic Forum’s Global Gender Gap Report. Eighty-eight percent of women in Rwanda have jobs, compared to 66 percent of women in the U.S. A whopping 64 percent of the African nation’s politicians are women, compared to our 19 percent.It's important to note that Rwanda, which placed sixth on the list, also boasts more gender equality than France (15th), Spain (25th), Germany (11th), Switzerland (8th) and Denmark (14th). Each country was graded on labor participation, health, political empowerment and educational attainment.So, how did Rwanda blaze past much of the Western world in women’s economic and political opportunity? The answer lies in recent history.The Rwandan genocide, a mass slaughter of the Tutsi minority population, tore apart families and killed roughly 800,000 adults and children in 100 days. Hutu extremists destroyed communities, raping an estimated 500,000 women.After the tragedy ended in July 1994, women banded together and demanded power. They changed the country’s constitution to require that women hold at least 30 percent of top political roles. They called for true equality in marriage. They took over farms. They delayed starting families to work and earn more.In a story for The Guardian last year, reporter Alexandra Topping, who visited Kigali, the country’s capital, wrote: “A swath of laws have given women the right to inherit land, share the assets of a marriage and obtain credit. As many girls as boys receive primary and secondary education, maternal mortality is lower and the birth rate is falling.”Things, of course, aren’t perfect. Topping notes that domestic violence still plagues households, despite public campaigns to stop it. And average lifespans in Rwanda remain low, the WEF report highlighted: 57 years old for women and 55 for men.The U.S., meanwhile, plunged eight slots on the gender equality ranking this year, slipping out of the report’s top 20. The wage gap and fewer women in senior government positions appear to have propelled the drop.Beyond discrimination, economists say both issues are exacerbated by America's lack of family-friendly policies, the soaring cost of child care and the cultural expectation that women, even sole breadwinners, should shoulder the bulk of domestic responsibilities. A recent Pew survey of more than 1,800 U.S. parents found both men and women have trouble balancing job responsibilities with family life. Mothers, however, reported tackling more chores than fathers, regardless of who earned more money: Sixty-four percent of female respondents said the majority of household work fell to them.American women also experienced an uneven recovery since the last economic downtown, which dragged down their labor force participation.About 8.7 million jobs disappeared during the last recession. American men have encountered less trouble getting back to work, according to the Economic Policy Institute. Between February 2010 and June 2014, they gained 5.5 million jobs, while women gained 3.6 million.Related:How American women fell behind Japanese women in the workplaceBoston is offering free salary negotiation workshops to every woman who works in the city                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     "
