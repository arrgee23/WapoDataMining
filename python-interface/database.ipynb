       "      <td>After a series of explosions rocked the airport and a metro station in Brussels on Tuesday, killing at least 30 and wounding scores of others, city and transit agencies across the U.S. beefed up patrols, taking similar measures to those in the wake of the Paris terror attacks last fall.In New York, counterterrorism resources were deployed to transit hotspots across the city. The New York Police Department said teams were sent to crowded areas and transit stops “out of an abundance of caution.”“At this time, there is no known indication that the attack has any nexus to New York City. We will continue to follow the situation in Belgium closely with the Joint Terrorism Task Force and the FBI and adjust the department’s deployments accordingly,” police spokesman Stephen P. Davis said in a statement.The United States Department of Homeland Security did not heighten its federal threat level, but advised the public to report suspicious activity. Homeland Security Secretary Jeh C. Johnson said in a statement that “additional security” would be deployed at major city airports and rail and transit stations across the country.New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) directed state officials to step up patrols at heavily traveled locations around the state, including bridges, tunnels, airports and mass transit systems, he said.“Public safety is paramount, and I want the people of this state to know that we are working with all local and federal partners, remaining vigilant and taking all necessary measures to keep New Yorkers safe,” he said in a statement.At JFK International Airport, New York National Guard forces were providing additional security detail. The Guard deployed 400 service members across the New York City area Tuesday, Cuomo said. They focused increased patrols on transportation hubs such as JFK and LaGuardia Airports. In addition, New York State Troopers were monitoring Penn Station and Grand Central Station as well as the Queens-Midtown Tunnel and George Washington Bridge. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey stepped up its police presence at airports, bridges, tunnels and the World Trade Center complex, Cuomo said. And the Metropolitan Transit Auhtority was upping patrols across the system.In Washington, Metro Transit Police advised passengers to remain vigilant. The agency said it would conduct additional K9 sweeps and patrols across the system Tuesday morning as a precaution, but that no “known, specific or credible threat” existed. Alexandria Deputy Police Chief Shahram Fard said in a Tweet that Alexandria Police patrol officers were assisting Metro Transit Police in monitoring Metro parking lots, and it was expected that agencies across the region would aid in the security effort.Internationally, the attacks led to the cancellation of hundreds of flights — mostly in and out of Brussels Airport — which closed Tuesday. Brussels Airlines had cancelled 203 flights by Tuesday afternoon, according to the Flight tracking website flightaware.com.On U.S. airlines, the site said, flights with Brussels on their itinerary were canceled. They included: A United Airlines flight bound for Dulles International Airport that was scheduled to leave Brussels at 7:10 a.m. Eastern Time on Tuesday, along with three other United flights; six Delta Airlines flights and two American Airlines flights — one bound for Philadelphia and another departing from there for the Belgian capital.American Airlines spokesman Kent Powell said the airline has made accommodations for passengers with reservations to Brussels, and arrangements would be made for those who remain in Belgium. Flights to and from Brussels were canceled through Thursday, he said. American’s next flight to Brussels is scheduled to depart Philadelphia on Friday evening, while its next flight from Brussels back to the U.S. is scheduled to leave the Belgian capital at 9:40 Saturday morning.“American Airlines is taking care of our employees and customers in Brussels after this morning’s events. At this time, there are no reported injuries to our employees. American Airlines check-in operates at Row 8 of the departure hall, and the explosions did not occur at Row 8,” Powell said. “American Airlines flight 751 from Brussels to Philadelphia has been canceled for today. When operations at the Brussels airport resume, we will reaccommodate our customers. We have issued a travel policy for customers with reservations to Brussels who wish to change their itineraries.”The Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority did not outline specific steps that were being taken at the region’s two major airports, Dulles International and Reagan National airports, but a statement reinforced the airports’ commitment to passenger safety. The statement encouraged passengers to stay vigilant and report any unusual activity.“Reagan National and Dulles International airports have a robust security structure, both publicly visible and behind the scenes,” the statement read. “We constantly train our employees and evaluate our security procedures, in collaboration with our federal partners and local mutual aid partners, to make adjustments, updates and enhancements based on new information and situations.”Officials at Baltimore Washington International Airport said they were “working closely” with federal and state law enforcement agencies after the Brussels attacks, but that no specific threat existed.Maryland officials said Tuesday that travelers should expect to see more police and canine explosive detection patrols throughout the state’s transportation network.“In the wake of the horrific attacks today in Belgium, we are taking every precaution to keep Maryland citizens safe and secure,” Gov. Larry Hogan (R) said in a statement. “In particular, there will be a more visible law enforcement presence at the airport, train stations and other mass transit locations around the state. I encourage all Marylanders, especially those traveling, to remain vigilant and aware of their surroundings at all times. If you see something unusual or unsettling, please report it immediately.”Transportation Secretary Pete K. Rahn said two pre-established law enforcement plans for the MTA Police and the Maryland Transportation Authority Police would be implemented.“In addition to the increased enforcement you do see, there are many measures in place that travelers won’t see,” Rahn said. “Please be aware of your surroundings and remember: ‘If you see something, say something.’ ”In Chicago, extra officers and canine units were dispatched to the airports and Chicago Transit Authority stations stations as a precaution, the Chicago Tribune reported. A police spokesman told the paper that the interim police superintendent has ordered “stepped-up presence at airports and transportation sites within Chicago.”In Los Angeles, the county sheriff’s transit police swept Union Station, the downtown train station, and heightened security at other transit hubs, according to the Los Angeles Times. Security would be increased at several of the city’s major metro stations, a spokesman told the paper.At Los Angeles International Airport, officers would be making their presence known more than usual, an airport police officer told the paper.And in San Francisco, there would be an increased uniform police presence at “key locations” across the Bay Area Rapid Transit system, said spokeswoman Alicia Trost. The system was also sending out a “See Something, Say Something” memo to passengers through its safety and security app BART Watch.Lori Aratani and Ashley Halsey III contributed to this post.</td>\n",

       "0  After a series of explosions rocked the airport and a metro station in Brussels on Tuesday, killing at least 30 and wounding scores of others, city and transit agencies across the U.S. beefed up patrols, taking similar measures to those in the wake of the Paris terror attacks last fall.In New York, counterterrorism resources were deployed to transit hotspots across the city. The New York Police Department said teams were sent to crowded areas and transit stops “out of an abundance of caution.”“At this time, there is no known indication that the attack has any nexus to New York City. We will continue to follow the situation in Belgium closely with the Joint Terrorism Task Force and the FBI and adjust the department’s deployments accordingly,” police spokesman Stephen P. Davis said in a statement.The United States Department of Homeland Security did not heighten its federal threat level, but advised the public to report suspicious activity. Homeland Security Secretary Jeh C. Johnson said in a statement that “additional security” would be deployed at major city airports and rail and transit stations across the country.New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) directed state officials to step up patrols at heavily traveled locations around the state, including bridges, tunnels, airports and mass transit systems, he said.“Public safety is paramount, and I want the people of this state to know that we are working with all local and federal partners, remaining vigilant and taking all necessary measures to keep New Yorkers safe,” he said in a statement.At JFK International Airport, New York National Guard forces were providing additional security detail. The Guard deployed 400 service members across the New York City area Tuesday, Cuomo said. They focused increased patrols on transportation hubs such as JFK and LaGuardia Airports. In addition, New York State Troopers were monitoring Penn Station and Grand Central Station as well as the Queens-Midtown Tunnel and George Washington Bridge. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey stepped up its police presence at airports, bridges, tunnels and the World Trade Center complex, Cuomo said. And the Metropolitan Transit Auhtority was upping patrols across the system.In Washington, Metro Transit Police advised passengers to remain vigilant. The agency said it would conduct additional K9 sweeps and patrols across the system Tuesday morning as a precaution, but that no “known, specific or credible threat” existed. Alexandria Deputy Police Chief Shahram Fard said in a Tweet that Alexandria Police patrol officers were assisting Metro Transit Police in monitoring Metro parking lots, and it was expected that agencies across the region would aid in the security effort.Internationally, the attacks led to the cancellation of hundreds of flights — mostly in and out of Brussels Airport — which closed Tuesday. Brussels Airlines had cancelled 203 flights by Tuesday afternoon, according to the Flight tracking website flightaware.com.On U.S. airlines, the site said, flights with Brussels on their itinerary were canceled. They included: A United Airlines flight bound for Dulles International Airport that was scheduled to leave Brussels at 7:10 a.m. Eastern Time on Tuesday, along with three other United flights; six Delta Airlines flights and two American Airlines flights — one bound for Philadelphia and another departing from there for the Belgian capital.American Airlines spokesman Kent Powell said the airline has made accommodations for passengers with reservations to Brussels, and arrangements would be made for those who remain in Belgium. Flights to and from Brussels were canceled through Thursday, he said. American’s next flight to Brussels is scheduled to depart Philadelphia on Friday evening, while its next flight from Brussels back to the U.S. is scheduled to leave the Belgian capital at 9:40 Saturday morning.“American Airlines is taking care of our employees and customers in Brussels after this morning’s events. At this time, there are no reported injuries to our employees. American Airlines check-in operates at Row 8 of the departure hall, and the explosions did not occur at Row 8,” Powell said. “American Airlines flight 751 from Brussels to Philadelphia has been canceled for today. When operations at the Brussels airport resume, we will reaccommodate our customers. We have issued a travel policy for customers with reservations to Brussels who wish to change their itineraries.”The Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority did not outline specific steps that were being taken at the region’s two major airports, Dulles International and Reagan National airports, but a statement reinforced the airports’ commitment to passenger safety. The statement encouraged passengers to stay vigilant and report any unusual activity.“Reagan National and Dulles International airports have a robust security structure, both publicly visible and behind the scenes,” the statement read. “We constantly train our employees and evaluate our security procedures, in collaboration with our federal partners and local mutual aid partners, to make adjustments, updates and enhancements based on new information and situations.”Officials at Baltimore Washington International Airport said they were “working closely” with federal and state law enforcement agencies after the Brussels attacks, but that no specific threat existed.Maryland officials said Tuesday that travelers should expect to see more police and canine explosive detection patrols throughout the state’s transportation network.“In the wake of the horrific attacks today in Belgium, we are taking every precaution to keep Maryland citizens safe and secure,” Gov. Larry Hogan (R) said in a statement. “In particular, there will be a more visible law enforcement presence at the airport, train stations and other mass transit locations around the state. I encourage all Marylanders, especially those traveling, to remain vigilant and aware of their surroundings at all times. If you see something unusual or unsettling, please report it immediately.”Transportation Secretary Pete K. Rahn said two pre-established law enforcement plans for the MTA Police and the Maryland Transportation Authority Police would be implemented.“In addition to the increased enforcement you do see, there are many measures in place that travelers won’t see,” Rahn said. “Please be aware of your surroundings and remember: ‘If you see something, say something.’ ”In Chicago, extra officers and canine units were dispatched to the airports and Chicago Transit Authority stations stations as a precaution, the Chicago Tribune reported. A police spokesman told the paper that the interim police superintendent has ordered “stepped-up presence at airports and transportation sites within Chicago.”In Los Angeles, the county sheriff’s transit police swept Union Station, the downtown train station, and heightened security at other transit hubs, according to the Los Angeles Times. Security would be increased at several of the city’s major metro stations, a spokesman told the paper.At Los Angeles International Airport, officers would be making their presence known more than usual, an airport police officer told the paper.And in San Francisco, there would be an increased uniform police presence at “key locations” across the Bay Area Rapid Transit system, said spokeswoman Alicia Trost. The system was also sending out a “See Something, Say Something” memo to passengers through its safety and security app BART Watch.Lori Aratani and Ashley Halsey III contributed to this post.  "

       "      <td>SAN DIEGO – A fog settled in over San Diego Bay Thursday morning, just as it does about every day this time of year, making the view across the water to Coronado a little hazy. But as baseball’s 30 general managers wheeled their bags to cabs and rode to the airport, scattering again, there were patches of clear blue sky, too. The four days of the offseason bonanza known as the Winter Meetings closed with a flurry of deals that shaped not only the holiday season and the month to follow, but the season to come.So here we go: A look at both the clarity and the haziness that remains.Three things we learnedThere’s nothing the Dodgers won’t doAndrew Friedman, the new president of baseball operations, long used magic potions and mysterious oils to conjure up competitive rosters with the low-to-no-budget Tampa Bay Rays. Farhan Zaidi, the new general manager, was a key force in defining the strategy behind Billy Beane’s cost-conscious moves in Oakland. They were granted a major league roster with excesses and an unlimited line of credit, and they went crazy here.To recap, the new Dodgers: shortstop Jimmy Rollins, second baseman Howie Kendrick, right-hander Brandon McCarthy, reliever Chris Hatcher and catcher Yasmani Grandal. Gone in trades: outfielder Matt Kemp (a franchise mainstay sent to San Diego), second baseman Dee Gordon and right-hander Dan Haren (both to Miami).“We felt like within the totality of it, we made ourselves a better team,” Friedman said as Wednesday turned into Thursday at the Manchester Grand Hyatt.And they’re not done. Though McCarthy fits perfectly into a rotation fronted by Clayton Kershaw, Zack Greinke and Hyun-Jin Ryu, Friedman indicated Los Angeles will pursue one more starting pitcher. They still could move veteran outfielder Andre Ethier. And while these moves clearly indicate an intention to win the World Series in 2015 – both Rollins and Kendrick are free agents following this season – the Dodgers are better prepared for the future as well because they didn’t have to part with their premium prospects, including outfielder Joc Pederson and shortstop Corey Seager.The Cubs’ rebuilding process is nearing the point where all the bricks are in placeThere was no bigger deal here than the six-year, $155-million contract Chicago granted free agent lefty Jon Lester – not so much because of what it did to the rest of the market, but what it did to the Cubs’ timetable. Suddenly, a roster that seemed constructed to contend in 2016 might do so a summer earlier because the ace is in place.Behind Lester in the rotation sit Jason Hammel (who returned as a free agent on a two-year, $20-million deal), Jake Arrieta and the promising Kyle Hendricks – a very nice place to start. Chicago also traded for Arizona catcher Miguel Montero, and though he has a chronic knee problem, he has averaged 133 games over the past four years. Add the fact that President Theo Epstein intends to add veteran pieces that can help in the clubhouse (outfielder Jonny Gomes?), that first baseman Anthony Rizzo seems ready to be a star and third baseman Kris Bryant – the best offensive prospect in the game – might come up at some point next summer, and Wrigleyville might generate more buzz than any ballpark neighborhood by August.The secondary pitching market is all but played outWhen the offseason began, the rankings of free agent starting pitchers was fairly clear: Max Scherzer, Lester and James Shields (in that order) made up the top tier, with a larger group of more affordable pieces behind them. But only Lester is gone from that group, and neither Scherzer nor Shields seems close to signing.If you wanted one of those players from the next tier, though, good luck. McCarthy is gone on his four-year, $48-million deal to the Dodgers. Francisco Liriano went back to Pittsburgh at three years and $39 million. As the meetings closed, Ervin Santana was reportedly agreeing to a four-year, $54-million deal with Minnesota, and Justin Masterson had signed for one year with Boston.Even the trade market for pitchers saw its share of activity. On Thursday alone, Boston acquired right-hander Rick Porcello from Detroit for a package that included outfielder Yoenis Cespedes – an exchange of players who will be free agents next offseason. That followed up the Red Sox’ acquisition of Wade Miley from Arizona. The Cincinnati Reds sent Mat Latos to Miami, Alfredo Simon to Detroit – and it’s possible they could move right-hander Mike Leake as well.Three things we don’t knowWill the Nationals stay intact or blow it up?The consensus among those who populated the long lobby and the two bars here all week – scouts, executives, agents – was this: How can Washington not keep the band together and be all-in for winning a World Series in 2015?But General Manager Mike Rizzo’s task is more complicated than that. GMs that simply have to go plug one or two holes – and the Nationals still need someone to play second base – can simply be aggressive in pursuing those positions. Washington, though, has five premier players due to be free agents in 2016 – right-hander Jordan Zimmermann, shortstop Ian Desmond, right-hander Doug Fister, reliever Tyler Clippard and center fielder Dennard Span. Rizzo does not believe he is being a good steward for the franchise if he gets to next November and all of those players walk away.How to solve this problem? All of those players have been discussed in trades, and the Nationals worked deep into Wednesday night – even as some executives had already departed San Diego – with Seattle heavily involved in the talks. It’s possible any of them could be dealt, and a trade of either Desmond or Zimmermann would shake up the rest of the sport. But it’s also possible the Nationals could work through the winter and find no fit for anyone – and report to spring training saying (gulp), “World Series or bust.”What will become of Scherzer and Cole Hamels?On Thursday, Tigers President Dave Dombrowski said his club was no longer in pursuit of Scherzer, who won the 2013 Cy Young award in Detroit. A Yankees source indicated earlier in the week that New York would not make its annual push for the winter’s marquee free agent. Meanwhile, agent Scott Boras expects Scherzer to establish his own market – knowing that he turned down a seven-year, $160-million deal from Detroit in the spring (one that included the first six years of his free agency at $144 million).So who the heck is left to land him? The Red Sox, still looking to upgrade their starting five, seem more likely to pursue Phillies lefty Hamels, who has four years and $94 million remaining on his deal. But if Boston can’t find a package that’s attractive to Philadelphia, the potential destinations for Hamels seem limited, too.The Giants won their third World Series in five years. Now what?San Francisco came in second for their own third baseman, postseason hero Pablo Sandoval, who left for Boston. They couldn’t overcome the relationship between Epstein and Lester in their pursuit of the lefty, and came in third despite reportedly offering a seventh year. They could lose versatile reliever Sergio Romo to free agency, too.The Giants certainly aren’t barren, but as the holidays approach, they have work to do. Could Chase Headley – who joins Melky Cabrera as the best remaining hitter on the free agent market — be Sandoval’s replacement at third base? Perhaps. They have money to spend, as their pursuit of Lester demonstrated. But GM Brian Sabean is unlikely to spend it just for the sake of spending it. Expect something shrewd here in the coming weeks.</td>\n",

       "top     SAN DIEGO – A fog settled in over San Diego Bay Thursday morning, just as it does about every day this time of year, making the view across the water to Coronado a little hazy. But as baseball’s 30 general managers wheeled their bags to cabs and rode to the airport, scattering again, there were patches of clear blue sky, too. The four days of the offseason bonanza known as the Winter Meetings closed with a flurry of deals that shaped not only the holiday season and the month to follow, but the season to come.So here we go: A look at both the clarity and the haziness that remains.Three things we learnedThere’s nothing the Dodgers won’t doAndrew Friedman, the new president of baseball operations, long used magic potions and mysterious oils to conjure up competitive rosters with the low-to-no-budget Tampa Bay Rays. Farhan Zaidi, the new general manager, was a key force in defining the strategy behind Billy Beane’s cost-conscious moves in Oakland. They were granted a major league roster with excesses and an unlimited line of credit, and they went crazy here.To recap, the new Dodgers: shortstop Jimmy Rollins, second baseman Howie Kendrick, right-hander Brandon McCarthy, reliever Chris Hatcher and catcher Yasmani Grandal. Gone in trades: outfielder Matt Kemp (a franchise mainstay sent to San Diego), second baseman Dee Gordon and right-hander Dan Haren (both to Miami).“We felt like within the totality of it, we made ourselves a better team,” Friedman said as Wednesday turned into Thursday at the Manchester Grand Hyatt.And they’re not done. Though McCarthy fits perfectly into a rotation fronted by Clayton Kershaw, Zack Greinke and Hyun-Jin Ryu, Friedman indicated Los Angeles will pursue one more starting pitcher. They still could move veteran outfielder Andre Ethier. And while these moves clearly indicate an intention to win the World Series in 2015 – both Rollins and Kendrick are free agents following this season – the Dodgers are better prepared for the future as well because they didn’t have to part with their premium prospects, including outfielder Joc Pederson and shortstop Corey Seager.The Cubs’ rebuilding process is nearing the point where all the bricks are in placeThere was no bigger deal here than the six-year, $155-million contract Chicago granted free agent lefty Jon Lester – not so much because of what it did to the rest of the market, but what it did to the Cubs’ timetable. Suddenly, a roster that seemed constructed to contend in 2016 might do so a summer earlier because the ace is in place.Behind Lester in the rotation sit Jason Hammel (who returned as a free agent on a two-year, $20-million deal), Jake Arrieta and the promising Kyle Hendricks – a very nice place to start. Chicago also traded for Arizona catcher Miguel Montero, and though he has a chronic knee problem, he has averaged 133 games over the past four years. Add the fact that President Theo Epstein intends to add veteran pieces that can help in the clubhouse (outfielder Jonny Gomes?), that first baseman Anthony Rizzo seems ready to be a star and third baseman Kris Bryant – the best offensive prospect in the game – might come up at some point next summer, and Wrigleyville might generate more buzz than any ballpark neighborhood by August.The secondary pitching market is all but played outWhen the offseason began, the rankings of free agent starting pitchers was fairly clear: Max Scherzer, Lester and James Shields (in that order) made up the top tier, with a larger group of more affordable pieces behind them. But only Lester is gone from that group, and neither Scherzer nor Shields seems close to signing.If you wanted one of those players from the next tier, though, good luck. McCarthy is gone on his four-year, $48-million deal to the Dodgers. Francisco Liriano went back to Pittsburgh at three years and $39 million. As the meetings closed, Ervin Santana was reportedly agreeing to a four-year, $54-million deal with Minnesota, and Justin Masterson had signed for one year with Boston.Even the trade market for pitchers saw its share of activity. On Thursday alone, Boston acquired right-hander Rick Porcello from Detroit for a package that included outfielder Yoenis Cespedes – an exchange of players who will be free agents next offseason. That followed up the Red Sox’ acquisition of Wade Miley from Arizona. The Cincinnati Reds sent Mat Latos to Miami, Alfredo Simon to Detroit – and it’s possible they could move right-hander Mike Leake as well.Three things we don’t knowWill the Nationals stay intact or blow it up?The consensus among those who populated the long lobby and the two bars here all week – scouts, executives, agents – was this: How can Washington not keep the band together and be all-in for winning a World Series in 2015?But General Manager Mike Rizzo’s task is more complicated than that. GMs that simply have to go plug one or two holes – and the Nationals still need someone to play second base – can simply be aggressive in pursuing those positions. Washington, though, has five premier players due to be free agents in 2016 – right-hander Jordan Zimmermann, shortstop Ian Desmond, right-hander Doug Fister, reliever Tyler Clippard and center fielder Dennard Span. Rizzo does not believe he is being a good steward for the franchise if he gets to next November and all of those players walk away.How to solve this problem? All of those players have been discussed in trades, and the Nationals worked deep into Wednesday night – even as some executives had already departed San Diego – with Seattle heavily involved in the talks. It’s possible any of them could be dealt, and a trade of either Desmond or Zimmermann would shake up the rest of the sport. But it’s also possible the Nationals could work through the winter and find no fit for anyone – and report to spring training saying (gulp), “World Series or bust.”What will become of Scherzer and Cole Hamels?On Thursday, Tigers President Dave Dombrowski said his club was no longer in pursuit of Scherzer, who won the 2013 Cy Young award in Detroit. A Yankees source indicated earlier in the week that New York would not make its annual push for the winter’s marquee free agent. Meanwhile, agent Scott Boras expects Scherzer to establish his own market – knowing that he turned down a seven-year, $160-million deal from Detroit in the spring (one that included the first six years of his free agency at $144 million).So who the heck is left to land him? The Red Sox, still looking to upgrade their starting five, seem more likely to pursue Phillies lefty Hamels, who has four years and $94 million remaining on his deal. But if Boston can’t find a package that’s attractive to Philadelphia, the potential destinations for Hamels seem limited, too.The Giants won their third World Series in five years. Now what?San Francisco came in second for their own third baseman, postseason hero Pablo Sandoval, who left for Boston. They couldn’t overcome the relationship between Epstein and Lester in their pursuit of the lefty, and came in third despite reportedly offering a seventh year. They could lose versatile reliever Sergio Romo to free agency, too.The Giants certainly aren’t barren, but as the holidays approach, they have work to do. Could Chase Headley – who joins Melky Cabrera as the best remaining hitter on the free agent market — be Sandoval’s replacement at third base? Perhaps. They have money to spend, as their pursuit of Lester demonstrated. But GM Brian Sabean is unlikely to spend it just for the sake of spending it. Expect something shrewd here in the coming weeks.  \n",
