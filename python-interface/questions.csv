But ESA Director General Jan Woerner said that the ESA part of the program didn't get enough backing or funding to ensure its future, although the space agency will continue to study asteroid defense in other ways.“These asteroid activities, looking at how we can really defend our planet in case something is happening and Bruce Willis is not ready to do it a second time .?.?. will be continued,” he joked to Reuters, referencing the 1998 movie “Armageddon,” in which Willis plays a driller who must save Earth from an asteroid capable of causing a mass extinction.The decision makes it even less likely that NASA will pursue its half of the mission, which would have sent a spacecraft slamming into the asteroid as ESA satellites observed the maneuver.The funding decisions came out of a two-day meeting of government ministers in Lucerne, Switzerland. Europe approved an extra 339 million euros for the ExoMars rover, and ESA said it could cobble together an additional 97 million euros by reshuffling funds internally, according to Nature.“After the many challenging, difficult and rewarding moments of 2016, this is a great relief and a fine result for European space exploration,” Don McCoy, ESA’s project manager for ExoMars, told Nature.The first half of the mission, which is a joint project of ESA and the Russian Federal Space Agency, arrived at Mars this October. It included the Trace Gas Orbiter, which will circle above the planet sniffing for gases that could be signs of habitability or even life, and the Schiaparelli lander. The latter spacecraft was primarily designed to test the technologies needed for landing — and it failed.An ESA investigation revealed that the lander misinterpreted sensor data during its descent, so it thought it was below ground level rather than two miles above it. Schiaparelli jettisoned its parachute, turned off its thrusters too early and went into a free fall before coming to a crashing halt on the Martian surface.[The Schiaparelli crash shows how difficult it is to land on Mars]It was a sadly familiar scenario. Roughly half of all Mars missions fail, and ESA had already lost one lander to the deadly descent to the surface. Prospects for the rover mission, which is already over budget and delayed from its original launch date in 2018, looked uncertain after the Schiaparelli crash.“Completion of ExoMars was probably the most challenging of our discussions because of the size of the additional resources that have been put on the table,” Roberto Battiston, president of the Italian Space Agency, told the BBC.But European ministers decided to commit to the project anyway. Engineers say they learned important lessons from the crash that will help the 2020 robot land safely on the Red Planet, where it will drill beneath the surface in search of microbes that might survive beyond the reach of deadly radiation.The ESA also committed to participating in the International Space Station until at least 2024.Read more:Elon Musk unveils Mars colonization plan, but don't pack your bags just yetNASA's Juno spacecraft may have a malfunctioning engineDear Science: How did the planets get their names?That study critiquing NASA’s ‘bad science’ on asteroids is pretty bad science",809

The four-seater can drive farther and refuel faster than any electric car a driver can buy.But the world’s biggest car company, even before the Mirai’s first California sale in October, is placing a massively risky bet on hydrogen, now sold at only a dozen American fueling stations. For many, it still evokesthe Hindenburg and the hydrogen bomb.The type of hydrogen fuel cells that run the Mirai have been repeatedly tried and abandoned by rival automakers, and electric-car pioneers have panned the technology as unrealistic and doomed to fail.“If you’re going to pick an energy source mechanism, hydrogen is an incredibly dumb one to pick,” Elon Musk, founder of Tesla, Toyota’s chief rival in the electric-car market, said in January. “It doesn’t make sense, and that will become apparent in the next few years.”Think of the Mirai as a small power plant on wheels. Instead of drawing energy from a battery, like the Nissan Leaf and Chevrolet Volt, the all-electric Mirai makes its own, by gulping in air and mixing it with hydrogen in a stack of fuel cells. The reaction cleanly powers the motor and belches out no exhaust, save for a thin trickle of water.Boosters of zero-emission vehicles have praised the Mirai — whose name in Japanese means “future” — as a solution to some of electric cars’ thorniest problems. The sedan can drive 300 miles on a full tank and be refueled in about five minutes — instead of needing to be plugged in overnight — making it an easier fit for the typical commute.Toyota has a track record for this sort of disruption, having built the first mass-produced hybrid, the Prius, from an experimental laughingstock into a clean and unexciting mainstream sedan. While still a niche — hybrids make up only 3 percent of American car sales — the Prius became emblematic of a way normal drivers could help save the world without trying too hard.“Toyota is so big that it can still be a science experiment for them,” said David Whiston, an equity strategist with investment researcher Morningstar. “If it doesn’t work out, they can go back to selling Priuses and all the other gas guzzlers no one ever talks about.”Yet these are very different roads than the ones the Prius first rolled onto 18 years ago. When drivers first bought the hybrid, they already had ways to fuel it — and no easier alternative if they wanted a greener drive.Today, the Mirai faces competition not just from electric vehicles but from traditional gas guzzlers, which because of tougher federal emissions standards drive more efficiently than ever. Traditional vehicles are also far cheaper: Though Toyota is pledging three years of free hydrogen and more than $5,000 in federal and state incentives could bring down the cost, the Mirai is about twice as pricey as the average mid-size sedan.Musk, whose company makes the electric flagship Model S, has become one of fuel cells’ most vocal critics, calling them “extremely silly” “fool cells” that siphon money and attention from the efficient battery systems that run most electric cars, including his.Nissan boss Carlos Ghosn has slammed the idea that a country as vast as the United States could efficiently build a network of hydrogen stations nearly from scratch. For Toyota, it could become a globe-spanning chicken-or-egg problem: That there are few hydrogen stations could lead to fewer drivers — and fewer of the customers those stations need to survive.Toyota, the $236 billion Japanese juggernaut, is starting small, with plans to make available only 3,000 Mirais in the United States by 2017, a sum close to the number of Ford F-150 trucks sold in a day.Most of those cars will cruise solely in California, home to 10 of the country’s 12 hydrogen refueling stations. Though other hydrogen fueling centers operate in Connecticut and South Carolina and more are in development, building or outfitting a station to supply the universe’s lightest element can cost $1 million or more.That slow start and scant infrastructure could limit how much hydrogen power can accomplish. In a report last year to investors, Citi Research analysts said they expect fuel-cell cars such as the Mirai to “have little impact on the auto market” until at least 2020.Environmental advocates have also questioned just how eco-friendly the Mirai can be. Hydrogen today is mostly produced from natural gas, a fossil fuel, and must be trucked to stations via tankers, unaided by the kind of nationwide grid that fuels battery-powered cars.Energy experts say hydrogen, over time, will increasingly come from clean renewable sources such as wind and solar. The Mirai, Toyota executives argue, is only the first step of a energy evolution that one said was the carmaker’s vision for “the next 100 years.”But the company is already pushing back on early skepticism, launching a “Fueled by Bulls--t” ad campaign named for one of Musk’s critiques to explain how hydrogen can be sourced from cow manure.The carmaker has also attempted to swat back safety concerns. Hydrogen is odorless and flammable but no more dangerous than gasoline and disperses quickly in case of leaks, company officials say. (To guard against those, engineers have gone so far as to fire high-caliber rounds to test the Mirai’s bulletproof hydrogen tanks.)The automaker has also taken to touting the Mirai’s versatility beyond the road. A plug in the trunk can turn the car into a mobile generator, the company says, delivering enough juice to power the average American home’s essentials for a week.Even in the small-batch world of environmentally friendly automaking, the Mirai’s production is an oddity, pieced together without use of a robot or conveyor belt in Toyota’s sprawling Motomachi plant in Japan. A dozen specialized workers in blue hard hats assemble the car by hand, turning out about three a day.Though no other automaker has pushed to mass-produce hydrogen cars, the Mirai is far from the first car to embark on the path to alternative power. Hydrogen-powered cars, such as the Hyundai Tucson, have gained loyal if microscopic followings in California. Honda, which recently retired its small line of FCX Clarity fuel-cell cars, said it plans to sell a space-age upgrade of the car, the FCV, sometime next spring.Toyota’s hydrogen crusade has gained a spirited boost in its home country of Japan, which plans to install fuel-cell stacks in more than 5 million homes over the next 15 years. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe became the first to own a Mirai, in December, and he recently celebrated the opening of Tokyo’s first hydrogen station as “the dawn of a true hydrogen society.”But this new age will require heavy government investment at levels American policymakers and taxpayers might be less excited about. Japan is now offering subsidies of 3 million yen, or about $25,000, to buyers of fuel-cell vehicles in Tokyo, which has pledged $375 million worth of hydrogen-related development before the city’s 2020 Olympics.Like the Prius, the Mirai could be what industry insiders call a “halo car,” a flagship meant to boost Toyota’s eco-friendly image rather than drive sales. That, skeptics say, would make Toyota’s boasting of a “hydrogen era” and the evolution of the Mirai more a marketing tactic than revolutionary act.But in the end, the trickiest obstacle for advanced fuel-cell cars might prove to be a simple one: price. At its cheapest, the Mirai can be leased for $499 a month, three times the cost of a new Corolla set to sip historically cheap gas.To succeed, Toyota will need to get “some people on board and willing to spend $50,000 on a compact car,” said Whiston, the Morningstar equity strategist. “Much li",375
11915bd8-7944-11e2-9c27-fdd594ea6286,duplicate,Cuba has outsized role in Venezuela as Chavez fights cancer,Juan Forero,1361143680000,The Washington Post,The Americas,"CARACAS, Venezuela — It’s become a well-worn routine here: A news flash about President Hugo Chavez’s battle with cancer is issued, invariably delivered with great fanfare but scant details.But what is increasingly troubling Venezuelans is not just the lack of candor that envelops the president’s condition, but that the news just as often comes from Cuba as it does from government ministries in Caracas. To protest what they call Cuban meddling, university students have chained themselves together in front of the Cuban embassy, and a growing chorus of opposition leaders charge that the Cuban government is calling the shots when it comes to Chavez’s health care.Amid rising tensions over the state’s secrecy, the government issued pictures of Chavez last week, the first time he had been seen publicly in 67 days. In the photos, Chavez is smiling and holding up a copy of Cuba’s state newspaper, Granma, from a hospital bed in Cuba.And just a few days before, revolutionary icon Fidel Castro — whom Chavez has called a father figure and a saint — offered more details than Venezuelan officials had by reporting that he received updates on the Venezuelan leader’s health “every day” and that Cuba’s most famous patient “is recovering.”“Ironically, Fidel Castro knows more about our president than the Venezuelans do,” quipped Federica Romer, 19, a university student who has been among those protesting outside the embassy.For some here, it is a sign that the small, poor island nation has an outsized role in Venezuelan affairs. It’s a role that seems to have grown since June 2011, when Chavez, speaking on national television from Havana, first revealed that he had undergone surgery on the island to remove a tumor.“I have to tell you that my indignation grows every day,” said Adicea Castillo, 75, an economist who helped topple Venezuela’s last dictatorship in 1958 and said she was once supportive of Fidel Castro. “It’s outrageous to see a government and a president so beholden in this way to Cuba.”Drawing closer togetherCuba’s influence on Venezuela is well known here. Over Chavez’s 14 years in power, Cuba has sent sports trainers and doctors to Venezuela’s poor barrios and provided intelligence agents to this country’s military. Venezuela has reciprocated with 100,000 barrels of oil a day at cut-rate prices, an economic lifeline that analysts say has helped keep the Castro regime afloat.Chavez’s government has also worked tirelessly for Cuba to be accepted by other Latin American countries, an effort that paid off last month when President Raul Castro assumed the presidency of a 14-month-old regional bloc called the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States.But Chavez’s cancer has drawn the two countries even closer, with the president spending more and more time in Havana as doctors grapple with a tumor that appears to have fended off four surgeries, chemotherapy and radiation treatments.Indeed, Chavez was last seen in Venezuela on Dec. 10, when he boarded an early-morning flight to Havana. He missed his Jan. 10 swearing-in for a fourth term and, until photographs of him were released Friday, no one aside from a small cabal of aides and family members knew for sure whether he was even alive.What Venezuelans do know is that the country’s top leaders have taken to flying constantly to Cuba to meet with Chavez. Those associates say Chavez has provided them with detailed instructions on running the state.But critics say that Chavez has been in no condition to govern and that Cuba’s government is helping plot Venezuela’s course.“What’s happening in Venezuela has no precedent in our history,” said Maria Corina Machado, an outspoken anti-Chavez lawmaker. “For the first time in 200 years of republican history, the decisions regarding the destiny of our country are being taken abroad.”Such accusations have angered Venezuelan officials, who call the relationship with Cuba “a brotherhood” based on mutual respect.But the government’s annoyance at the criticism has done little to curb growing resentment among some Venezuelans.‘A great uncertainty’In recent days, university students have chained themselves outside the Cuban embassy, which has drawn other protesters angry about Chavez’s long sojourn in Havana. With a phalanx of National Guard troops protecting the embassy, the students have been sleeping on cushions and blankets in the middle of the street.They say they won’t leave until they have clear answers about the president’s health.For the protesters, the photographs issued by Chavez’s aides proved nothing. They noted that the government still has not said what kind of cancer Chavez has nor revealed details about his prognosis or whether he will even return to Caracas.“We Venezuelans are living a great uncertainty, really, because we don’t know the truth,” said Gustavo Frias, 23, who spent the weekend at the embassy with other students. “We don’t know how the president is, if he’s fine, if he’s alive, if he’s dead. The truth is what we want to know.”Emilia Diaz-Struck contributed to this report.",807

For many years the Lubieniecki painting existed only on lists documenting looted art, accompanied by a black-and-white photo to prove its existence.Now, decades after its theft, “Portrait of a Young Man” is back with Polish officials, the FBI announced Monday.Where had the painting been all this time? Mostly in Ohio, according to authorities, and some serendipitous research helped unearth it.[Why two American museums are fighting to keep art stolen by the Nazis]The Lubieniecki painting has long been thought to have been one of many that the Nazis stole from the Warsaw museum in October 1944 and took to an Austrian palace, the FBI said in a statement. That palace, identified by the Polish embassy as Fischhorn Castle, eventually came to house an Allied Forces battalion.A small chapel in the castle was “filled with works of art that had been stolen by the Nazis and used as a depository,” according to the Monuments Men Foundation, which honors service members tasked with protecting art and architecture in war-ravaged Europe.“‘The Portrait of a Young Man’ was apparently later discovered by a U.S. serviceman while in Austria,” the FBI said in a statement. “The soldier is believed to have brought the artwork to the United States after his service abroad.”[Art looted by the Nazis could be hiding in plain sight on the walls of Europe’s great museums]The solider died and the painting was sold to “innocent purchasers” throughout the Columbus, Ohio area, according to the FBI. And there it remained, in Ohio, for many years.But recently a relative of the U.S. solider came across photos of the artwork while conducting some family research. More research revealed that the painting, once housed in the Warsaw museum, had likely been taken by the Nazis.The soldier’s relative reached out to Polish authorities and “upon learning of the historic rights of the painting, the possessors agreed to return the work to Poland,” the FBI said.Officials held a repatriation ceremony in the FBI’s Columbus office.“We are honored to return this painting to the Polish government and the National Museum,” Special Agent in Charge Angela Byers said in a statement. “This was truly a cooperative effort among the U.S. government and our international partners to ensure this work of art was returned to its homeland.”[A frenzy in Poland over the latest mysterious ‘Nazi gold train’]Poland’s Ministry of Culture and National Heritage has a database of more than 63,000 objects lost during WWII. “Several dozen works of art” have been recovered so far, according to the Polish embassy.Last year, U.S. federal officials returned to Poland “St. Philip baptizing a servant of Queen Kandaki” by German artist Johann Conrad Seekatz. “Stolen art, antiquities, and fraudulently-acquired artifacts, these are the little known casualties of war,” U.S. Special Agent in Charge of Homeland Security Investigations James Hayes said at the time.“We treat every painting, every sculpture, every historical artifact with utmost importance — they are the missing pieces of a puzzle that make up the Polish national heritage,” then-Polish minister of culture and heritage Bogdan Zdrojewski said in 2014.",422

We may never know the exact beginning or end of Romanticism or the Gilded Age, or where lies the line between art and entertainment, or what distinguishes great talent from genius. But that doesn’t make those concepts hollow, just fluid and approximate.A new entertaining and insightful exhibition at the Smithsonian’s National Portrait Gallery confronts one of the most dynamic and hard to define concepts in American cultural life — the cool. “American Cool” broaches its subject through photographs of people who helped define and embody the cool since before the idea had even taken definite form, to the current day when it is highly questionable if the “cool” is still meaningful. If you want to know how porous the category is, consider all of the following, officially inducted into the realms of the cool by this exhibition: Walt Whitman, Frederick Douglass, H.L. Mencken, Buster Keaton, Jackson Pollock and Susan Sontag. They join artists, entertainers and celebrities who are more traditionally and obviously defined as cool: Lester Young (who plays the central historical role in defining and promoting the idea of cool), Humphrey Bogart (the first and greatest mass-market embodiment of the cool) and Jack Kerouac (who helped export the cool from jazz to broader countercultural application).To govern what seems at first like a highly subjective free-for-all, curators Joel Dinerstein and Frank H. Goodyear III laid down a four-part test for each of the 100 people included. First, they must have made an original artistic contribution, with a signature style; second, they must have in some way been rebellious or transgressive; third, they must have iconic status; and fourth, they must have left a significant cultural legacy. But even those parameters can’t contain the many things we think are definitional about the cool, the aura of mystery, the stoical indifference to criticism, the attitude of self- possession, and seemingly superficial yet important questions of dress and personal style. In a catalog essay accompanying the exhibition, Dinerstein piles on with yet more things that are the opposite of cool: “To be cool is not to be nice or good or heroic; cool is the opposite of innocence or virtue. Cool has an edge and a dark side: to be cool is not to strive to be fabulous .?.?. or saintly.”Dinerstein is, among other things, a scholar of jazz, and Goodyear has a degree in American studies, and so they present the cool as essentially a pop culture phenomenon, and distinctly American. Other cultures have similar ideas — nonchalance, sangfroid, sprezzatura — but they are not “cool.” Sprezzatura dates back to Castiglione’s “Book of the Courtier,” which prized a seemingly effortless virtuosity in all things, from art to social behavior. Sangfroid is distinctly French, a sense of composure and equilibrium, especially under fire.These are, according to the curators, concepts derived from aristocratic entitlement, whereas American cool is generally working class, an “earned individuality” rather than an inherited sense of self-worth. Perhaps, though the aristocratic definition of these ideas was breaking down around the same time that this exhibition posits the origins of the cool. Walt Whitman — the first personality featured in the exhibition, which calls him “the guiding light of American bohemia” — published “Leaves of Grass” in 1855; in 1844, Alexandre Dumas began serializing “The Count of Monte Cristo,” in which a self-made working-class young man assumes an aristocratic name and character to exact revenge on his enemies. Few characters in literature are more suave, self-possessed, disciplined, eccentric and alluring — in a word, cool. And none of that was technically inherited.But the authors have a point. In America, at least, cool is distinctly lower or middle class, reflecting its origins in African American culture, where it was a compensation mechanism for living under the brutal regime of racism. When Lester Young said “I’m cool,” writes Dinerstein, “it meant ‘I’m keeping it together in here against invasive social forces.’” Frederick Douglass, whose oratory was fiery, not cool, merits inclusion in the exhibition because, according to Goodyear, he used a carefully constructed photographic identity to challenge preconceptions about race and African American men. “Though he lived prior to cool’s popularization, his cultivation of this mask of stylish stoicism presaged the rebellions of others who sought to live within yet also apart from the mainstream.”Stylish stoicism is an excellent phrase. But as the exhibition charts the historical evolution of the cool, “stylish stoicism” fits less well with the later, countercultural appropriation of the cool. Transgression becomes more important than style and talent, even directionless, purposeless, self-destructive transgression. When Marlon Brando’s character in the 1953 film “The Wild One” is asked “Hey, Johnny, what are you rebelling against?” and he answers, “Whaddaya got?” — the cool has clearly gone through a critical permutation. Brando is, of course, featured in the exhibition, looking sad, innocent and distracted in a 1950 image by Philippe Halsman.The exhibition situates this evolution of the cool in the period from 1960 t0 1979, but it was clearly nascent earlier than that. “Cool & Counterculture: 1960-1979” is one of the most fascinating and provocative stretches of the show, including diverse figures from Andy Warhol and Paul Newman to Jack Nicholson and Bill Murray. One particularly evocative juxtaposition places a reprint of a 1966 photograph of Muhammad Ali with his fist thrust directly into the camera lens next to a 1971 image of Clint Eastwood, holding an enormous handgun in a visually analogous confrontation with the viewer. Clearly the concept has become elastic if it can encompass a black boxer playfully enacting an aggressive identity and a white actor appealing to working class (and often racist) fantasies of public order and vigilantism.The exhibition ends with what it calls “The Legacies of Cool: 1980-present.” Here we find David Byrne (definitely cool), Steve Jobs (geek cool), Willie Nelson (long-haired, hippie stoner cool) and Jon Stewart (really?). Perhaps the most telling image is a photograph of skateboarder Tony Hawk, doing a move in his kitchen. His young son sits at the kitchen counter while his wife cradles a baby. The dishwasher is open, there are decorative plates above the standard-issue wooden cupboards and the whole thing screams suburbia. The wall text notes his success as an entrepreneur, with a popular line of sports equipment and a video game series. In an interview Dinerstein acknowledged that old ideas about transgression may not be so important any more. What matters now is “new strategies for individuality.”The exhibition is heavily focused on celebrity, though there are some surprises (the Hawaiian surfer Duke Paoa Kahanamoku appears in a circa 1915 photograph). But as the concept of the cool becomes more and more open-ended, it’s unfortunate that it isn’t extended further beyond popular music and film. Susan Sontag definitely seems a worthy inclusion, but are there no classical musicians, ballet dancers or post-structuralist philosophers who are cool? Was the great violinist Jascha Heifetz cool? Or just cold? Was the literary theorist Jacques Derrida cool? Or just inscrutable?It’s also unfortunate that the cool isn’t treated more critically as a concept. There is a dark side of cool, dumb, impassive, disengaged, dismissive and even violent (see the oeuvre of Quentin Tarantino). Think of the phrase “too cool for school,” and all that implies. Although “geek” cool makes a brief appearance in the person of Jobs (on a motorcycle), the rise of geeks and nerds as positive cultural archetypes may be a sign of a healthy resistance against the stupid underbelly of cool.

This Thursday, it motored toward the Vietnamese coast under protection of a naval vessel. Pirates of unknown nationality had seized the ship Oct. 2 and kept its crew hostage while they siphoned a third of its cargo: some 2,000 metric tons of oil. ""They put knives on our throats and threatened to kill us if we resist,"" the ship's deputy captain told the Associated Press by cellphone. One crew member broke his leg after trying to flee the pirates, reported the AP.Luckily, there were no fatalities. The pirates jumped ship with their stolen booty and the tanker had to enlist the help of a passing fishing vessel to figure out its location and call for help.The incident marked the latest pirate attack near the Malacca Strait, a body of water that links the Indian Ocean and the South China Sea, making it perhaps the world's most vital conduit for global shipping. It carries some 40 percent of world trade through its waters every year. The lands flanking these waters have been contested by local kingdoms and sultanates, Arabs, Chinese, and the forces of European colonial powers. Singapore, one of the world's most important ports, emerged in the 19th century as a pivotal entrepot straddling this passage. It was also, in its early days, a haven for pirates.The attack was the 12th such pirate hijacking attempt in Southeast Asia since April, raising concerns about an escalation in piracy in this strategic waterway. The rise has been conspicuous enough that it initially dominated the fevered speculation surrounding Malaysian Airlines flight 370, when it tragically disappeared earlier this year.From a dip in 71 attacks reported in the Malacca Strait and adjacent South China Sea in 2009, numbers surged back to 161 reported attacks in 2013. This graph from German news site Deutsche Welle lays out the trend over the past two decades.Half a decade ago, as the world fretted over the terrors of Somali piracy, strategists pointed to the relative success of counter-piracy measures in the Malacca Strait as a guide for how to deal with the threat of the Horn of Africa. In a 2011 report, the American Enterprise Institute, a D.C-based conservative think tank, hailed the success of the ""Malaccan formula"":The Strait of Malacca between Indonesia, Malaysia, and Singapore offers some interesting solutions. The “formula” in the Strait of Malacca, as outlined by Lt. Commander Jamiola of the U.S. Navy, consists of state-sponsored naval forces, regional intelligence sharing, surface surveillance radars, an effective court system, and fighting the origins of piracy on land. It has proved extremely successful, with the number of pirate attacks in the region declining each year since 2003.An international task force began patrolling the waters off Somalia's lengthy coastline along a similar model, forcing Somali pirate ""motherships"" further afield from their bases on shore. The number of pirate attacks dried up, with piracy off West Africa's coast now becoming a greater security concern.Piracy monitors caution that the recent spike in attacks near the Malacca Strait involves many ""low-level thefts,"" including raids and burglaries conducted at night when ships are at anchor in port. The growing trend does not necessarily mean there's a greater deterioration and pirate threat in the region. This year alone, the U.S. navy held military exercises with Singapore that focused in part on anti-piracy maneuvers.",367

Wootson Jr.,1499692634000,The Washington Post,Animalia,"Asleep in the mountains northwest of Boulder, Colo., a teenage camp counselor was awakened Sunday morning by a loud crunching sound.The noise was the sound of large teeth scraping against his skull, he told Denver ABC-affiliate KMGH. A black bear, the teen realized, was trying to pull him out of his sleeping bag by his head.“It grabbed me like this and pulled me, and then it bit the back of my head and dragged me,” the teen, identified only by his first name, Dylan, told KMGH. “When it was dragging me, that was the slowest part. It felt like it went forever.”Fellow staffers and campers were roused by the commotion and tried to scare the bear away as Dylan fought back. The bear dragged Dylan about 10 feet, then dropped him and walked away.Dylan was taken to the hospital. His injuries weren’t life threatening. Authorities are searching for the bear, which will likely be euthanized, according to the Associated Press.The teen is a counselor at Glacier View Ranch, a camp owned by the Rocky Mountain Conference of Seventh Day Adventists, the AP reported. According to the camp’s website, the conference hosts seven weeks of summer camps for youth ages 7 to 18. The camps feature zip lines, go-carts and canoeing, “all in a safe, Christ-centered atmosphere.”The ranch confirmed the attack on its website, and said it would not cancel the rest of the summer’s camps. About 100 children and teens are expected to attend.Campers that Dylan was supervising over the weekend had asked if they could spend the night under the stars, sleeping by the camp’s lake. Dylan relented.He told reporters he teaches wilderness survival at the camp.How fortuitous. One of the tips experts recommend for surviving a bear attack is to fight back.Dylan’s experience follows other troubling reports of bear attacks, including two fatal maulings in Alaska a day apart last month.On June 18, Patrick “Jack” Cooper, a 16-year-old from Anchorage, was killed by a bear after he veered off a trail during a mountain foot race south of the city, according to the AP. A day later, Erin Johns, a 27-year-old contract worker for Pogo Mine died in a mauling 275 miles northeast of Anchorage. Her 38-year-old co-worker was also injured.Authorities told the AP they were baffled by the uptick in bear attacks, although the numbers can fluctuate from year to year. Dylan said his experience hasn’t changed his attitude toward bears. In fact, he was back at camp — sporting fresh scars — when he talked to reporters.“I’m not afraid of the bears. I’m not afraid of sleeping outside anymore. You just have to be aware and respect the animals,” Dylan said.Read more: Scientists have identified the 50-foot creature that washed up on an Indonesian beachHe was on his way to meet the mayor.

Seems like common sense, but every time an eclipse comes around, a few people invariably try to watch it without special, protective eye wear and end up damaging their eyeballs.Even during August’s solar eclipse, when the moon will travel across the sun and block part of the sunlight, you cannot look directly at the sun without very strong protective eye wear. Not just sunglasses — lenses that were designed specifically to filter out enough of the light that it doesn’t burn a hole through your retinas.If you did try to look at it without your glasses, it would be “like a magnifying glass on a leaf when you were a kid,” an optometrist tweeted at me. That’s what’s illustrated (in graphic detail) in the video at the top of this story.I’m not trying to provoke panic about watching the solar eclipse. Hundreds of thousands — perhaps millions — of people across the United States are going to walk outside Aug. 21, look up, and see something truly spectacular. That’s something I look forward to.But because I’m curious (and quite a few people have asked), I thought it would be interesting to talk about what would happen if you tried to look at the sun during the eclipse. And don’t tell me it doesn’t happen and people know better. That’s not true.According to an expert answer on the University of California at Santa Barbara ScienceLine, ” … doctors collect information after events like the 1999 solar eclipse, when people who stared directly at the sun for several minutes went to see their doctor. In one study, about half had permanent damage.”An assessment after the same eclipse in Britain found fewer cases than they had feared, but 14 people still managed to damage their eyes by staring at the eclipse.There’s even a tale that Isaac Newton stared at the sun with one eye (for the sake of science, of course), and afterward he could only see reds and blues. I have no idea if that is fiction or fact, but it sure makes a good story.Want to watch the eclipse safely? Here’s how it will go …… if you’re in the path of totality:It will start as a partial eclipse as the moon begins to cover the sun. Keep your glasses on at this point.When the sun is totally blocked by the moon, you can take your glasses off! Enjoy. It’s beautiful.Once sunlight starts to appear again, as the moon departs, put your glasses back on and enjoy the partial eclipse.… if you’re not in the path of totality:You’ll only be seeing a partial eclipse. There will be harmful sun rays for the duration of the event. Keep your eclipse glasses on through the whole thing.Yes, you will go blind if you manage to endure the pain and stare at the sun for long enough. The pain from the visible part of the light spectrum could be extreme, but ultraviolet light — which we can’t see — can also damage the eye. It literally gives your eye a sunburn.The reason a few people always end up going blind during an eclipse is that in the partial phase, the visible light is reduced enough that it’s no longer painful or uncomfortable to look at and so people assume it’s safe. But depending on the sky conditions, it only takes about a minute and a half for your eyes to be permanently damaged, and the damage is cumulative, meaning you don’t have to stare at the sun without looking away for it to be harmful — you may just be taking quick glances, but it’s still damaging your eye.If your eyes are damaged, your vision will at least be blurry and you may see dark or yellow spots. If it’s significant damage, you may not be able to see out of the center of your eye — only your peripheral vision.Other things you should be aware of: Some drugs dilate your pupils, which will decrease the amount of time it will take to burn the eye. People taking these drugs should always take care to wear UV-blocking sunglasses. Also, looking through a camera lens or a telescope will not protect your eyes. The latter is blatantly obvious in the video. Unless it has a filter on it that is made specifically for blocking out the harmful rays, you should not look through any lenses.This story has been altered to make it clearer that both visible and U.V. light can damage the eye, albeit different parts of the eye.",427
30a493b8-fb07-11e4-9ef4-1bb7ce3b3fb7,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/jury-weighs-death-penalty-for-boston-maratho,Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev sentenced to death despite appeals for mercy,Adam Goldman,1431715380000,The Washington Post,National Security,"BOSTON — Two years after the horrific bombing of this city’s famed marathon, a federal jury on Friday sentenced to death one of the young men responsible for the attack, turning away appeals for mercy from his attorneys and even some victims.The jury of seven women and five men rendered its decision after deliberating for more than 14 hours. As the verdict was read, the bomber, 21-year-old Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, displayed no sign of emotion.The outcome was a victory for prosecutors, who said the former college student worked in tandem with his older brother and carried out the attack in a “heinous, cruel and depraved manner.” Jurors rejected arguments that Tsarnaev had fallen under the sway of his brother, Tamerlan, and was remorseful over the suffering he caused.Tsarnaev will be transferred to a federal prison, where he will remain until he is put to death by lethal injection. His attorneys did not comment after the verdict, but they are expected to appeal the sentence.After the verdict, Karen Brassard, who was wounded in the attack, said there was “nothing happy about having to take someone’s life.” But she called the outcome “a just conclusion.”“Right now, it feels like we can take a breath and breathe again,” she said.Tsarnaev will become the 62nd federal inmate on death row, according to the Death Penalty Information Center. But it has been more than a decade since the federal government executed an inmate, and the Obama administration is reviewing its protocol for carrying out the death penalty after a botched Oklahoma state execution last year.But the Justice Department, under Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr., decided last year to seek the death penalty in Tsarnaev’s case. After Friday’s verdict was read, Holder’s successor, Loretta E. Lynch, issued a statement calling the sentence “the ultimate penalty” and “a fitting punishment for this horrific crime.”Tsarnaev faced the possibility of death on 17 charges and was sentenced to death on six of them.Prosecutors had depicted him as a cold-blooded killer, repeatedly arguing that his placement of explosives near a young child was evidence of his depravity and one of the aggravating factors that supported a death sentence. Eight-year-old Martin Richard was one of three people killed in the April 15, 2013, bombings near the finish line of the Boston Marathon.More than 260 others were injured; 17 of them lost limbs. Tsarnaev was also charged with killing Sean Collier, a police officer employed by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in the aftermath of the attack. Although jurors found Tsarnaev guilty of murdering Collier, they did not sentence him to die on that count, a disappointment for prosecutors and the law enforcement community.Throughout the trial, prosecutors emphasized the scope of the carnage to jurors, outlining the death and destruction in graphic detail.“This is not a day of celebration. It is a day of reflection and healing,” Carmen M. Ortiz, the U.S. attorney for Massachusetts, told reporters after the verdict. “It is time to turn the page.”Prosecutors argued that Tsarnaev and his brother — who died in a shootout with police days after the bombings — were inspired by radical Islam and moved to violence out of a sense of vengeance over the U.S. wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. In the boat where the younger Tsarnaev was eventually captured, authorities found a note: “Stop killing our innocent people and we will stop.”“Those are the words of a terrorist convinced that he has done the right thing,” Assistant U.S. Attorney Steve Mellin told the jury. “He felt justified in killing and maiming and seriously injuring innocent men, women and children.”In April, the jury that sentenced Tsarnaev had found him guilty of all 30 charges he faced in connection with the 2013 bombings, one of the worst terrorist attacks in the United States since the Sept. 11, 2001, hijackings.Although Tsarnaev’s attorneys never contested that he was involved in the bombings, they mounted a vigorous defense during the penalty phase of the trial, seeking to convince jurors that mitigating factors demanded that they spare his life. Central to that argument was the notion that he was naive and impressionable — he was 19 at the time of the attack — and merely following Tamerlan, whom the attorneys depicted as the mastermind of the plot. Defense attorneys also argued that the younger Tsarnaev deeply regretted his actions.The vast majority of the jurors did not accept those arguments. Only two found that he had “expressed sorrow and remorse for what he did and for the suffering he caused,” according to the lengthy verdict form read aloud in court. Only three jurors found that he was under the influence of his brother and would not have committed the crimes but for Tamerlan.Tsarnaev’s legal team included attorneys with deep experience in capital cases. One of them, Judy Clarke, had previously persuaded juries to spare the lives of clients facing the death penalty, including Sept. 11, 2001, conspirator Zacarias Moussaoui.If sentenced to life, Tsarnaev would have been held at a Supermax prison that has been described by a former warden as a “version of hell” and a place that “is not designed for humanity.” His attorneys used such descriptions to argue before the jury that a life sentence would not be a reprieve.Clarke told the jury that a life sentence would allow “for the possibility of redemption and a greater opportunity for healing for everyone involved.”“Mercy’s never earned, it’s bestowed,” she said. “And the law allows you to choose justice and mercy.”Victims of the marathon bombings were divided on the sentence. Although some argued publicly that they believed Tsarnaev deserved the death penalty, others — including the family of the 8-year-old boy — called for his life to be spared. Ortiz said she took their views seriously.For other survivors and relatives of victims, a life sentence would have proved insufficient.Said Michael Ward, a firefighter who was watching the marathon in 2013 and who helped victims after the explosions: “This nothing to celebrate. This is a matter of justice.”Tsarnaev “wanted to go to hell,” he said, “and he’s going to get there early.”Mark Berman and Sari Horwitz in Washington contributed to this report.",808

Bezos, the next owner of The Washington Post, says he doesn’t have all the answers for what’s ailing the newspaper industry or for the financially challenged news organization he is preparing to buy. But he says he’s eager to start asking questions and conducting experiments in the quest for a new “golden era” at The Post.In his first interview since his $250 million purchase of The Post was announced in early August, Bezos said his basic approach to operating the business will be similar to the philosophy that has guided him in building Amazon.com from a start-up in 1995 to an Internet colossus with $61 billion in sales last year.“We’ve had three big ideas at Amazon that we’ve stuck with for 18 years, and they’re the reason we’re successful: Put the customer first. Invent. And be patient,” he said. “If you replace ‘customer’ with ‘reader,’ that approach, that point of view, can be successful at The Post, too.”Bezos, 49, spoke via phone from Seattle on Friday, four days before he was scheduled to visit The Post for the first time since the announcement of its purchase from The Washington Post Co. and the controlling Graham family. The sale, which shocked the news industry, is expected to close in October.Bezos said his major contribution to the business will be in offering his “point of view” in discussions with the paper’s leadership about how the publication should evolve. He also said he provides “runway” — financial support over a lengthy period in which the management can experiment to find a profitable formula for delivering the news.“If we figure out a new golden era at The Post .?.?. that will be due to the ingenuity and inventiveness and experimentation of the team at The Post,” he said. “I’ll be there with advice from a distance. If we solve that problem, I won’t deserve credit for it.”During his visit Tuesday and Wednesday, Bezos plans to meet with Post publisher Katharine Weymouth and top managers of the paper’s business and editorial operations. He will tour the newsroom in downtown Washington and the production plant in suburban Springfield, Va.Wednesday’s visit will be bracketed by meetings with Post journalists — first with about 20 reporters and editors in the morning and concluding with a town hall-style meeting with the entire newsroom in the afternoon. The last time Bezos encountered a roomful of the paper’s journalists was in 1999, when he was the guest of Katharine Graham, the company’s late chairman, during a luncheon interview with reporters and editors.Based on his comments in the interview Friday, Bezos appears unlikely to make any major decisions or pronouncements during his visit or propose any immediate changes. He said he is eager to meet with and listen to managers and learn about the news organization’s operations.The Post is the first newspaper that Bezos has owned and will be operated as a stand-alone business, independent of Amazon. Bezos intends to keep his “day job” as chairman and chief executive of Amazon and will continue living in Seattle, where the company is based.Bezos is one of the world’s richest men, with a net worth of around $24 billion, based on the current value of his Amazon stock holdings. His deep pockets, technological savvy and reputation as a long-term strategic thinker were among the attributes that Post Co. chief executive Donald E. Graham cited in selling him The Post after 80 years under the Graham family’s control. Graham said he saw no alternative to continued investment, which would be difficult for a publicly traded company.Graham and Weymouth, his niece, quietly put the business up for sale earlier this year after concluding that The Post required an owner capable of making sustained investment in it.Bezos agreed: “It’s important for The Post not just to survive, but to grow,” he said. “The product of The Post is still great. The piece that’s missing is that it’s a challenged business. No business can continue to shrink. That can only go on for so long before irrelevancy sets in.”In the interview, Bezos stressed that he has no immediate fixes for newspapers in general or for The Post, which is beset by Web-based competition that has weakened its advertising base and steadily sapped its print readership.“Don was helpful in interviews [following the purchase] when he said, ‘Mr. Bezos is a businessman, not a magician,’?” Bezos said. “I thanked him for that afterwards. In my experience, the way invention, innovation and change happen is [through] team effort. There’s no lone genius who figures it all out and sends down the magic formula. You study, you debate, you brainstorm and the answers start to emerge. It takes time. Nothing happens quickly in this mode. You develop theories and hypotheses, but you don’t know if readers will respond. You do as many experiments as rapidly as possible. ‘Quickly’ in my mind would be years.”But Bezos suggested that the current model for newspapers in the Internet era is deeply flawed: “The Post is famous for its investigative journalism,” he said. “It pours energy and investment and sweat and dollars into uncovering important stories. And then a bunch of Web sites summarize that [work] in about four minutes and readers can access that news for free. One question is, how do you make a living in that kind of environment? If you can’t, it’s difficult to put the right resources behind it. .?.?. Even behind a paywall [digital subscription], Web sites can summarize your work and make it available for free. From a reader point of view, the reader has to ask, ‘Why should I pay you for all that journalistic effort when I can get it for free’ from another site?”Although he said he reads The Post, New York Times and Wall Street Journal regularly, Bezos didn’t grow up immersed in newspapers or dreaming of being involved with one. His “love affair,” he said, has always been with “the printed word in all its forms.” Amazon started as an online book retailer; it now publishes its own books. It has also moved into video production, competing with Netflix and others in streaming original programs. Bezos’s wife, MacKenzie, is a published novelist.The Internet and Amazon’s launch of the Kindle e-reader convinced him that the printed word doesn’t have to be on paper. “The key thing about a book is that you lose yourself in the author’s world,” Bezos said. “Great writers create an alternative world. It doesn’t matter if you enter that world” via a digital or printed source.After Graham broached the idea of Bezos buying the paper earlier this year, Bezos said he spent two months contemplating what he could bring to the business. He was convinced that The Post was “an important institution,” and he said he was optimistic about its future. But he needed time to think over a third issue.“I had to convince myself that I could bring something to the table,” he said. “I discussed this at great length with Don. I thought I could, because I could offer runway and some skill in technology and the Internet and a point of view about long-term thinking, reader focus and the willingness to experiment.”Added Bezos: “I’m a genetic optimist. I’ve been told, ‘Jeff, you’re fooling yourself; the problem is unsolvable.’ But I don’t think so. It just takes a lot of time, patience and experimentation.”Asked how he saw The Post — as a local, national or international news organization — Bezos demurred. “That’s a question that needs to be answered in concert with the leadership team of The Post. Is it local? Or national? Is it something new?” Whatever the mission, he said, The Post will have “readers at its centerpiece. I’m skeptical of any mission that has advertisers at its centerpiece. Whatever the mission is, it has news at its heart.”Craig Timberg contributed to this article.",824

Two more states and the District of Columbia will raise the minimum later in the new year.The greatest increase will apply to companies in New York City with at least 10 employees. Minimum-wage workers at these businesses will receive a raise of $2 an hour on Saturday as the floor increases from $9 to $11. More-modest increases will apply to smaller firms in New York City and companies elsewhere in the state.Workers also will receive substantial raises in states carried by President-elect Donald Trump. In Arizona, the hourly minimum will increase from $8.05 to $10. The floor will increase from $7.50 to $9 in Maine, from $8.50 to $8.90 in Michigan and from $8 to $8.50 in Arkansas.Those increases follow a series of convincing wins for labor on the issue in Republican territory. Polling by the Public Religion Research Institute last year found that 3 in 5 Republicans and nearly 3 in 4 independent voters would support increasing the federal minimum wage from $7.25 to $10.10.In 2014, for instance, voters approved increases in Alaska, Nebraska and South Dakota. In Arizona in November, voters approved an initiative to increase the minimum wage by a comfortable margin of 58 percent to 42 percent.Trump, who carried Arizona with 49 percent of the vote, has taken inconsistent positions on the minimum wage.When asked in a debate a year ago whether he supported an increase in the minimum wage, he said, “I would not do it.” In May, though, Trump altered his position, seeming to suggest that, while he would support an increase in the minimum, he thought that states should set the levels and that the federal government should not enforce a minimum at all.Trump's nominee to be secretary of labor, Andrew Puzder, is a fast-food executive who has written that substantial increases in the minimum wage will force employers to hire fewer workers.While proponents of minimum-wage increases have had impressive successes, they did not expand that momentum this year to the 21 states that have not set floors above the federal minimum of $7.25. Workers making the minimum in those states will not get a legally mandated raise this year.Seven of the 19 states raising minimums this weekend will record modest increases of between a nickel and a dime per hour to adjust for increases in the cost of living.More from Wonkblog:The hidden cost of made-in-America retail bargainsThose jobs Trump is bragging about are just a fraction of Sprint's huge layoffsThe public is being kept in the dark about Trump’s deal with Carrier",816

The award is typically reserved for military derring-do or nuclear scientists. More confusing still was the official announcement, which stated with conspicuous vagueness that the ""traffic girl,"" as they're typically called, was being honored for ""safeguarding the security of the headquarters of the revolution in an unexpected circumstance."" What circumstance? What does ""safeguarding"" mean?An official state video showed the traffic cop, a young woman name Ri Kong Sim, convulsing with emotion as she received her award.The conspiracy theories flowed quickly, with a North Korean defector organization suggesting that she may have saved leader Kim Jong Un from an assassination attempt. According to some thinly sourced reports, North Korean agents may have staged car accidents in the past to kill their targets.It turns out, though, that the explanation may be considerably more modest. New Focus International, a North Korean news organization that sources from defectors and from volunteer citizens within the country, says that its sources in Pyongyang indicate that Ri ""received the award for putting out a fire that broke out near a propaganda poster."" The poster allegedly bore the name of leader Kim Jong Un.This explanation might sound absurd, but it's not implausible. I suggested this could be the case in my original post on Ri's mysterious award, noting that North Korea often grants high honors to people who simply save official portraits of its national rulers. Those omnipresent portraits, like the Eucharist at a Catholic mass, are considered quasi-holy symbols of everything that’s supposed to matter in the North Korean state ideology.New Focus International's story also notes that North Korea is still technically in a ""Grade 1 War-Readiness State,"" owing to recent tensions with the United States. This state includes special, heightened rules requiring citizens to protect images and icons of the leaders. That's partly about propaganda and ideology – Kim is the embodiment the state, after all – but it also has the nice effect, probably comforting for Kim, of making it the personal duty of every North Korea citizen to care so much about their leader that they'll even self-sacrifice to protect a banner carrying his name.""The Real North Korea,"" a new book by the highly respected scholar Andrei Lankov, also discusses the degree to which official state ideology treats posters and banners of the Kim family as holy relics, the embodiment of the semi-divine leaders themselves. In this clip, Lankov discusses an unsettling incident in which a father was rewarded for allowing his 5-year-old daughter to drown so that he could save a poster of former leaders Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il:In an emergency, statues and portraits are to be protected whatever the cost, as any sacred object should be — and North Koreans are reminded that they must safeguard the images. For example, in 2007 the official media widely reported an incident that allegedly occurred in August of that year.During a severe flooding, Kang Hyong Kwon, a factory worker from the city of Ich’on, was trying to make his way to safety through a dangerous stream. While leaving his flooded house, he took the two most precious things in his life — his five-year-old daughter and portraits of Leaders Generalissimo Kim Il Sung and Marshal Kim Jong Il. Suddenly overwhelmed by the current, he lost grip of his daughter, who fell into the swollen waters, but still managed to keep hold of the sacred images. The media extolled North Koreans to emulate Kang Hyong Kwon, a real-life hero.Think about that for a moment. If North Korean officials are going to promote this man as a hero for saving a poster of the Kims while his daughter drowned, would it really be so surprising if they granted a top military honor to a traffic cop who saved a burning banner bearing Kim Jong Un's name?That's a significantly different story from the initial rumor that she had prevented Kim's assassination. As the North Korea scholar Stephanie Kleine-Ahlbrandt quipped on Twitter, ""We know so little about North Korea that a military medal given to a traffic cop becomes rumor of a coup.""",442
3c5be31e-24ab-11e5-b621-b55e495e9b78,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/to-greeks-german-offers-of-help-sound-more-like-a-threa,Germans would rather send humanitarian aid than forgive Greece’s debts,Michael Birnbaum,1436289480000,The Washington Post,Europe,"ATHENS — Maybe the German leader meant to reassure Greece when he promised emergency assistance of food and medicine. But to many in the embattled Mediterranean nation, it sounded more like a threat.The hard line on Greece adopted by Europe’s economic powerhouse has, if anything, strengthened in the days since Greek voters resoundingly rejected tougher cuts, sending shock waves through the continent.Now Germany is refusing to budge on cutting Greece’s mountain of debt, even as the leftist leadership here — and the International Monetary Fund — insist that no deal is viable without such a reduction. This tough stance comes from a rules-oriented nation where even the language is conspiring against Greece’s struggles: Germans use the same word for “debt” and for “guilt.”“Of course we do not want to abandon the Greeks, but they do not have to be a member of the euro zone in order to receive help,” said Christian von Stetten, a lawmaker from German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union, summarizing an increasingly prevalent view in the German capital.“If, from the very beginning, there had been sanctions for not sticking to the rules, we would not have this problem,” von Stetten said. He noted that Greece was not the only member of the 19-nation euro zone to run afoul of the thicket of regulations that govern borrowing and spending in the monetary union.The mounting German anger after the Greek referendum on Sunday is a major challenge for Merkel, who, as the euro zone’s most powerful leader, needs to hold together its fractious members while preserving her domestic standing. She does not want to be blamed for a sudden Greek exit from the euro zone, but giving away too much would cost her at home.France and others are starting to break away, calling for a softened deal in the aftermath of the referendum. Merkel’s electorate, however, has had no such turnabout. Nor have her political allies.“Today we need the Iron Chancellor: No new billions for Greece!” read the front-page headline in Tuesday’s Bild tabloid, the top-circulating newspaper in Germany. It was accompanied by a doctored image of Merkel sporting a spiked helmet of the kind worn by Otto von Bismarck, the 19th-century leader who conquered Europe to build the German empire.“A lot of people in the government have moved toward the position where they say, ‘Let’s get rid of them no matter what,’?” said Sebastian Dullien, a senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations in Berlin.Many Germans say that without steely regulations to govern the conduct of European nations, the 63-year-old project to integrate the continent would swiftly fall apart. Giving in to populists in Greece would embolden others like them in places such as Spain and Italy, they say, and soon there would be a wave of political and economic upheaval across Europe.Merkel has repeatedly shot down Greek bailout proposals that insist on debt relief. As the clock ticked Tuesday on the collapse of the Greek banking sector, she again said ahead of a meeting of euro-zone leaders that she did not see any basis for negotiations.The tough approach aligns well with Germany’s broader attitudes toward rules and predictability. Germany is a nation where jaywalking is rare, even when streets are clear of cars, and where most subway stations use the honor system, operating without turnstiles.The adherence to rules is such a key tenet of life there that many Germans say they would rather send humanitarian aid if Greece goes bankrupt than forgive its debts and risk breaking the covenant that when money is borrowed, it must be repaid.Until the introduction of the euro, bankrupt individuals in Germany could wipe out their debts only after 30 years. Credit card usage in the country is among the lowest in Europe, and even many big-box stores there take only cash.That maximalist approach toward Greece, however, could prove costlier for German taxpayers, because the struggling nation would be unable to repay Germany’s $88 billion share of European rescue loans if it went bankrupt. A debt reduction would slice only a share off Greece’s towering obligations.But many German leaders are dead set against compromise.“Greece’s entry into the euro zone was very naive from today’s perspective,” German Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel told the newsmagazine Stern on Tuesday. Gabriel is also the leader of the center-left Social Democrats.“Nothing is gained if we just cut debt without fundamental changes in Greece,” Gabriel said. On Monday, he said E.U. countries needed to start readying humanitarian aid for Greece. He spoke from his party’s headquarters in Berlin, where red flags still fly and Karl Marx’s images adorn office walls. Similar parties in other countries have long favored stimulus spending and fought austerity, so his position is emblematic of the stark differences in German discourse.If Greece exits the euro zone, the aid may well be necessary. Greece imports much of its food and almost all of its medicine. Without a working banking system, or with a sharply devalued new currency, Greeks would struggle to pay for the basics while the cost of imports would rise sharply. After just over a week of capital controls that prevent Greeks from sending payments outside the country, shortages of staples are starting to appear.Some critics say that Germany’s aversion to softening Greece’s debt obligations ignores its own history. In a recent interview with Germany’s Die Zeit newspaper, economist Thomas Piketty pointed to Germany’s post-World War II debt restructuring. That deal, done under different circumstances, wiped away about half of what Germany owed other nations, including Greece.As basics dwindle on the shelves of Greek supermarkets, Merkel is playing a tricky balancing act, with much to lose if she takes a strong stand on either side of whether Greece should remain in the euro zone. Her legacy would suffer if she were seen as kicking the Greeks off the common currency. But if she advocates debt relief, voters may punish her at home. Already, her even tougher finance minister, Wolfgang Schäuble, has started to surpass her in popularity polls.Merkel “wants to avoid it being her to decide over this,” said Stefan Kornelius, author of a biography of the chancellor. He also wrote a column published Tuesday saying it was time for Greece to leave the euro zone.“She wants the Greek government to decide. She set the rules, and she wants Greece either to commit to it or leave it,” Kornelius added.Stephanie Kirchner in Berlin contributed to this report.Read more:7 key things to know about Greece’s debt crisis and what happens nextA hilarious Monty Python sketch explains why Greece is in a huge crisisThe forgotten origins of Greece’s crisis will make you think twice about who’s to blame",378

The sting of his family’s forced departure from Cuba led him to become one of the principal funders of the U.S. anti-Castro movement.Now, contrary to what almost anyone could have imagined, the 76-year-old Fanjul has begun to reassess old grievances and tentatively eye Cuba as a place for him and other U.S. businessmen to expand their enterprises. Quietly, without fanfare, Fanjul has started visiting the island of his birth and having conversations with top Cuban officials.“If there is some way the family flag could be taken back to Cuba, then I am happy to do that,” Fanjul said in a rare interview, publicly discussing his recent visits to the island for the first time.Fanjul’s about-face is a startling development for the exile network that has held a grip on the politics of U.S.-Cuba relations for decades and has played an outsize role in presidential campaigns. His trips place him at the vanguard of a group of ultra-wealthy U.S. investors with roots on the island whose economic interests and political clout are pushing the two countries toward a thaw in their half-century standoff.Fanjul, in the interview, said repeatedly that his primary motivation in visiting Cuba has been a desire to “reunite the Cuban family,” referring broadly to the Cuban diaspora and those who remain on the island. Business considerations could be explored only if there are political and diplomatic advances, he said.“The [Fanjul] family was in Cuba for 150 years, and, yes, at the end of the day, I’d like to see our family back in Cuba, where we started. .?.?. But it has to be under the right circumstances,” said Fanjul, who is best known by his nickname, “Alfy.” “One day we hope that the United States and Cuba would find a way so the whole Cuban community could be able to live and work together.”Fanjul, who lives in Palm Beach, Fla., and whose family holdings include Domino Sugar and refineries across the United States, Latin America and Europe, has managed to maintain a remarkably low profile for a politically connected tycoon. His access to the highest levels of power was evident during the Monica Lewinsky scandal of the 1990s, when the special prosecutor’s report noted that President Bill Clinton received a call from Fanjul during a private Oval Office moment with the intern.Last week, the Fanjul family’s influence over policymakers was on display when the U.S. House passed a farm bill that would cut subsidies to many agricultural products while leaving unscathed the controversial, taxpayer-backed program that protects sugar profits.Fanjul visited Cuba in April 2012 and again in February 2013 as part of a delegation licensed through the Brookings Institution, the Washington think tank that has produced recent papers criticizing U.S. policy and calling on the Obama administration to further loosen sanctions. In Havana, he lingered with tears in his eyes at his family’s colonial-era manse, now a museum, with its elegant columns, lush inner courtyard, sparkling chandeliers and grand staircase.He was so taken by the nostalgia and excitement of returning to the familiar streets of his youth, a travel companion recalled, that Fanjul enthusiastically chatted up random people of all ages as he walked around. He also met with Cuba’s foreign minister and toured state-run farms and a sugar mill with Cuban agricultural officials.Unlike most other Cuban Americans who travel to the island, Fanjul has direct access to some of America’s most important policymakers. After returning from his first trip, Fanjul met with his good friend, then-Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, to express his changing views on Cuba. In November, Fanjul once again discussed his evolving mind-set with Clinton and her husband at a Clinton Foundation fundraiser in the Miami home of Cuban American businessman Paul Cejas, a former U.S. ambassador to Belgium.Many embargo supporters say U.S. policy should change only when certain conditions are met, such as regime change or political reforms. Fanjul, however, said he prefers not to answer the question of whether he would require the fall of the Castro government or an end to communism before doing business in Cuba — saying that he respects existing U.S. law.“Right now there’s no way for us to consider investing in Cuba. How can you work a deal if you’re not legally allowed to do it?” he said.“Now, would we consider an investment at some later date?” continued Fanjul, a permanent U.S. resident who maintains Spanish citizenship. “If there’s an arrangement within Cuba and the United States, and legally it can be done and there’s a proper framework set up and in place, then we will look at that possibility. We have an open mind.”He said the Cuban government — which has business deals with companies from countries such as Canada and Spain — would have to change its economic structure to make it easier and safer for outside companies to make money.“Cuba has to presumably satisfy the requirements that investors need, which are primarily a return on investment and security of the investment, so they feel comfortable with what they’re doing,” he said. “I personally would look at that in the same framework as any investor would.”Evolving politicsThe logistical, political and legal complexities involved in any potential expansion of U.S.-based businesses onto Cuban soil are staggering. Fanjul’s willingness to hold meetings with the Castro government puts him on a potential collision course with Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Robert Menendez (D-N.J.), a Cuban American whose campaigns have been supported by Fanjul but who is an unwavering advocate for the embargo and has the power to thwart any attempts to lift it.Trickier still would be the impact on presidential politics, with Florida’s Cuban American electorate still a significant factor in the battle for that state’s crucial electoral college votes.Already, there have been signs that younger Cuban Americans, particularly those born in the United States, are moving away from the hard-line views of their parents and grandparents. Now, as Fanjul’s recent gestures show, even some of the most entrenched exiles are evolving, and politicians accustomed to embracing the Cuba trade embargo in their pursuit of Florida’s large Cuban American electorate will have to calibrate the risks and rewards of evolving along with them.Hillary Clinton, the putative Democratic front-runner for president if she chooses to run in 2016, spoke out in favor of the Obama administration’s actions relaxing restrictions on family travel and cash flow to the island. Yet she, like many politicians in both parties, has repeatedly expressed support for continued sanctions. She is close with several key players, besides Fanjul, who have stated an openness to more engagement with Cuba.Fanjul, a longtime supporter of Bill Clinton’s campaigns and causes, would probably be a major donor, as well as a close adviser on Cuba-related matters, to Hillary Clinton should she run. Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D), a longtime Clinton confidant, traveled to Cuba for a trade mission in recent years and held discussions with high-ranking government officials there. And Cejas, whom Bill Clinton appointed ambassador to Belgium, has expressed doubts about the U.S. trade embargo against Cuba.“I can tell you one thing that became very clear to me: The embargo is really an embargo against America ourselves. Because Americans cannot do business with Cuba, where there are incredible opportunities for growth,” said Cejas, who traveled to Cuba with Fanjul.The issue could prove thornier for Republicans, ",414
43e9f3f12982c0e0bb15ad64b33a89c0,https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/wp/2014/12/17/the-sony-hack-why-would-any-outlet-n,The Sony hack: Why would any outlet not report the sordid — and newsy — details?,Erik Wemple,1418858910000,The Washington Post,Erik Wemple,"The New York Times is playing it safe on the Sony documents.“This is stolen material,” New York Times reporter Jeremy Peters said today on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe.” “As our lawyers are telling our reporters at the New York Times, we are not to open these e-mails. We are not to actively look at them. We are only allowed to report on what has been out there because this is stolen material and trafficking in it is, in itself, a criminal act.”This stolen material has been dredged up by a hacking effort known as “Guardians of Peace” against Sony Pictures Entertainment, which produced “The Interview,” a film starring Seth Rogen and James Franco as journalists who sign on to a government plot to assassinate North Korean strongman Kim Jong Un. Reams of internal Sony information have spilled from the hack — e-mails, data on salaries and business considerations — not to mention the fact that producer Scott Rudin called star Angelina Jolie a “minimally talented spoiled brat.”Sony demands that media organizations do not republish the hacked material. In a strongly worded Dec. 14 letter to publishers, superlawyer David Boies wrote that Sony “does not consent to your possession, review, copying, dissemination, publication, uploading, downloading, or making any use of the Stolen Information.” Those who dis Sony on this matter are in trouble, according to Boies, who writes that the company will have “no choice but to hold you responsible for any damage or loss arising from such use or dissemination by you.”The Times has taken that threat seriously. In a same-day piece on the Boies letter, the newspaper turned up its nose at other outlets that have participated in the disclosures: “Until now, the data has provided a feast for traffic-hungry websites like Fusion and those owned by Gawker Media, along with some mainstream news organizations like Bloomberg, which last week posted an article — without citing names — revealing details of employee medical records that were made public by the hackers.”As for its own approach, that same Times piece disclosed, “The Times has reported on some Sony emails and company-related data based on the accounts of other news organizations and on statements from Sony executives. Sony representatives have acknowledged the authenticity of the emails and data.” Huffington Post media reporter Michael Calderone obtained further clarification from The Times, which outlined a balancing act: “The Sony situation poses difficult questions. We don’t condone hacking into private computer systems. We also don’t like depriving our readers of information they care about.”Actor Brad Pitt, Jolie’s husband, found something unsavory in the reporting frenzy: “I don’t see a difference in News Corp hacking phone calls and hacking e-mails. I don’t think we should be able to participate,” said Pitt. “I think someone’s conversation, whether in e-mail or in person, should be private. We shouldn’t be participating and these sites that are disseminating them should stop. They won’t. And we should stop reading them. We won’t. It’s more of an indictment on us, I think.”Pitt sees no difference in these two things; the law sees an enormous one. As the Erik Wemple Blog has noted previously, Supreme Court jurisprudence protects U.S. media organizations that lawfully receive information that’s been unlawfully obtained. Say what? Yes — if some scoundrel hacks into a computer or illegally tapes a phone call and then posts it to the Internet, there’s nothing illegal about passing it along. That very protection is encased in a 2001 Supreme Court case, Bartnicki v. Vopper, which involved a scandalous recording of a phone conversation, one that had been allegedly recorded illegally, that ended up in the hands of talk radio host Frederick Vopper. Justice John Paul Stevens wrote for the court that Vopper acted within the law: “[A] stranger’s illegal conduct does not suffice to remove the First Amendment shield from speech about a matter of public concern.”Clay Calvert, a University of Florida professor, told the Erik Wemple Blog for a previous post, “If the news media lawfully obtain truthful information about a matter of public significance, then the government may not constitutionally punish publication of the information, absent an interest of the highest order.” For further analysis, see this post by Eugene Volokh, who notes that two of the six justices in the majority opinion opined that the information needs to be of “great public concern.”Bold text added to highlight the triviality of much of the Sony hacking oeuvre. Is a Hollywood producer’s attitude toward Angelina Jolie a matter of public significance? Are the negotiations of New York Times journalists with Sony executives of matter of public significance? Is the fact that Sony bigwig Amy Pascal had to apologize over racially insensitive e-mails a matter of public significance? Well, she apologized and her replacement appears likely, according to the Hollywood Reporter. Case closed on public significance.Appeals to suppress the work of these hackers automatically elicit sympathy. In the pantheon of American leaking heroes, the Guardians of Peace aren’t Daniel Ellsberg (Pentagon Papers); they aren’t W. Mark Felt (Watergate); they aren’t Jeffrey Wigand (tobacco); they aren’t Edward Snowden (National Security Agency). Instead, they’re a group that has threatened terrorism on theaters that show “The Interview.”Yet it’s not the media’s job to judge the people who steal information. The media’s job is to judge the stolen information itself: If it’s worth publishing, then publish.Some may argue that media trafficking in the Sony documents will only encourage other hackers to break into other companies’ systems. If that’s true, then those companies should buttress their systems. But either way, that’s not the problem of news outlets.",822

Mark R. Warner after the Virginia Democrat asked Metro and the Washington Council of Governments about communication breakdowns during the Jan. 12 incident near the L’Enfant Plaza station that killed one person and injured 86 others.Federal investigators are reviewing the cause and the response to the smoke that filled a tunnel near the L’Enfant Plaza station, where a train had become disabled. Their early inspection found “severe electrical arcing damage” to the rail and cables inside the tunnel.Metro is collecting information on radio testing being conducted throughout the system to present to a committee of fire chiefs that works with the regional government council, said Metro spokesman Dan Stessel. A meeting of that committee is set for this month, according to the letter to Warner.“We would like to see this meeting happen as soon as possible,” Stessel said.Stessel also said Monday that Metro has resolved radio problems that affected coverage in parts of the Wheaton Station on the Red Line. Montgomery County Fire and Rescue had flagged the issue to Metro Friday afternoon after its crews ran a routine test, according to a fire department e-mail.The problem involved a connector on a cable that carries signals from aboveground to the underground station.The problem at Wheaton was the only one found after testing at the county’s 12 Metro stations, Stessel said. While a repair was pending, firefighters were reminded to communicate using a radio-relay system that positions them within sight of each other at key points between the tunnel and surface.Signal-relaying equipment is built into the subway and maintained by Metro. But regularly troubleshooting communication problems falls on Metro and each local jurisdiction.Although Metro and local jurisdictions test radio communications within the system, they do so independently of each other.Warner said he sees “a real challenge” more than a decade after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks and massive investments in emergency communications.“Your system may be working but the handoff — the interoperability — is the place where so many things can go wrong,” Warner said.Warner said the letter laid out a tentative timeline for making changes, but even the earliest actions would be two months off.Warner was part of the local congressional delegation given a limited briefing of events about the crisis. An early review found that District firefighters in the L’Enfant Plaza tunnel had trouble communicating with commanders aboveground. Since then, Metro and the D.C. Fire Department have largely blamed each other for the communications problem.Their dispute centers on whether the District made technical changes to the way its radios work, when those changes were made, and what it told Metro about those changes in order for the rail system to make equipment adjustments in response.An e-mail released by the District as part of its review of the incident shows that firefighters flagged a radio problem to Metro in an e-mail on Jan. 8, four days before the incident at L’Enfant Plaza.Metro officials said crews worked through that weekend trying to pinpoint a problem on its side, and when it couldn’t find any arranged for a Jan. 14 meeting with the District for additional checks, two days after the L’Enfant Plaza incident occurred.Metro and D.C. emergency officials say the communication problems have been fixed.",363

Other charges range from 10 to 20 years in federal prison, the Justice Department said in a release.Seven Mexicans and one Guatemalan were found dead in the trailer in San Antonio under stiflingly hot summer conditions, with as many as 200 people tightly packed and struggling to breathe through small holes. Two migrants later died in a hospital.Currently, two remain hospitalized, five were released to immigration authorities, and 22 are being held as material witnesses, according to the Justice Department.Some of the travelers had spent days held in a house near the border with Mexico. Some were told to pay hundreds of dollars to a group linked to Los Zetas, a deadly Mexican drug cartel, for safe passage across the Rio Grande in rafts, The Washington Post reported.Bradley initially told authorities he was unaware of the trailer’s cargo and was surprised when he realized people had been trapped inside. He owned the truck found outside Walmart but not the trailer, according to public records. He told federal agents that the trailer’s refrigeration system did not work and that the vent holes were probably clogged, according to the criminal complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas.The truck’s discovery revealed the group’s horrifying journey to the United States at a time when immigration arrests have spiked under President Trump and illegal border crossings have plummeted, according to federal officials. The case also highlighted the extreme dangers people face as they try to enter the country.Jack Staton, acting assistant director of intelligence for Immigration and Custom Enforcement’s Homeland Security Investigations arm, called human smuggling “100 percent crime against humanity,” adding that “this is just victimizing people that are attempting to get a better life.”“The smugglers closed the doors and the interior of the trailer was pitch black and it was already hot inside,” James Lara, a special agent with Homeland Security Investigations wrote in the complaint after interviewing one of the migrants.“He stated they were not provided with any water or food. People inside were making noise to get someone’s attention but nobody ever came.”Maria Sacchetti, Mark Berman and Lindsey Bever provided additional reporting.

Almost 29 million cars already have been recalled after inflater ruptures killed 10 people in the United States and maimed at least 100 more.Rosekind said Thursday that the inflaters being installed in recalled vehicles may themselves become defective but that the evidence suggests they will perform to design for several years.“At this point we’re only seeing ruptures at 7? 1/ 2 years,” Rosekind said. “A certain number that are being replaced have at least a 7? 1/ 2 -year time span available for that safety to protect people in the vehicle.”The news that some recalled vehicles may need to have their air-bag inflaters replaced twice adds a fresh layer of complexity to the issue. The air bags were manufactured by the world’s largest maker of air bags, a Japanese firm named Takata, and installed by a majority of automakers. Unlike most air-bag makers, Takata uses ammonium nitrate to trigger a small explosion that inflates the air bag when the vehicle strikes something.But in some vehicles — particularly those that were several years old and kept in regions with high humidity — the ammonium nitrate burns too fast, causing the chemical’s container to explode and spray drivers and passengers with metal shrapnel.Many Takata replacement air bags still use the ammonium nitrate that is suspected to cause the explosive malfunctions, and Rosekind said Thursday that testing has proved that the chemical deteriorates over time.Many air-bag inflaters have been replaced since the recalls began in 2014, and dealers should have notified drivers about whether their new inflaters were triggered by ammonium nitrate and whether they should be replaced a second time when inflaters without the chemical become available, Rosekind said.“If the dealer tells you that it’s an interim remedy, then you would know that you’ll be recalled again for a second fix,” Rosekind said. “You don’t want people to get that first [replacement] and think they’re done.”With replacement air bags on back order, many dealers have been telling drivers who have received recall notices that it may take weeks or months before their inflaters can be replaced.Getting drivers to comply with recall notices is a challenge, said Mitch Bainwol, president of the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, a trade group that represents 12 major foreign and domestic automakers.“We do mail and email until we’re blue in the face,” Bainwol told the House subcommittee. “It’s tough. We need help.”NHTSA is launching a pilot program in which automakers work with state motor-vehicle administrations to include recall information in renewal notices for licenses and auto registration. Six states will take part in the pilot program.“As much as is currently being done, it’s not enough,” Rosekind said, enumerating 19 new strategies developed to draw the attention of drivers to recall notices.Huma Hanif, 17, died March 31 when an air bag malfunctioned after her car hit another vehicle at an intersection in suburban Houston. The auto dealer and Honda said they had sent six air-bag recall notices to Hanif’s family, but family members said they had not received the notices.On Wednesday, NHTSA gave Takata until the end of 2019 to prove that their new process for ensuring the safety of inflaters triggered by ammonium nitrate is effective. The company is using a drying agent called desiccant to keep the chemical from deteriorating when exposed to heat and humidity. If Takata fails to provide that proof, it could lead to a recall of an additional 85 million cars.Rep. Janice Schakowsky (D-Ill.) asked Rosekind whether potentially defective air bags were being installed in newly manufactured cars.“It would be illegal to sell a known defect in a new car,” Rosekind said.An earlier version of this story stated that Takata has until the end of 2018 to prove that their new process for ensuring safety of inflaters is effective. The company has until the end of 2019.",397

The dog was killed when one of the people in the apartment detonated a suicide vest.Diesel's death sparked a popular hashtag and an outpouring of respect and grief on social media. And it highlighted the role specially trained dogs play in often dangerous law enforcement situations in France, as well as right here in the United States.It's unclear exactly how many police dogs are active in the United States. Jim Watson, director of the North American Police Work Dog Association, gave a ""wild guess"" of around 50,000 dogs in 2010. The dogs are deployed to various domestic law enforcement agencies, doing everything from bomb- and drug-sniffing to chasing down suspected criminals.And, unfortunately, police dog work can sometimes be deadly. The Officer Down Memorial Page, which tracks police fatalities in the line of duty, includes numbers on police dog fatalities as well. Their numbers show that in 2015 so far, 26 police dogs have been killed in the line of duty — a number that's up sharply over the previous two years.In the most recent incident they've tracked, a dog named Hyco with the Anderson County Sheriff's Office in South Carolina was shot and killed while chasing a group of suspected carjackers. In September, a police dog named Ike in Washington state was stabbed multiple times while attempting to subdue a suspect and had to be euthanized due to the extent of his injuries.But while a number of dogs have died at the hands of a suspected criminal this year, the ODMP's numbers show that canine officers face an even bigger threat: heat exhaustion, particularly from being left in a squad car on a hot day.This year alone at least 11 dogs died from heat exhaustion, according to the ODMP. In August, two dogs with the Baltimore City Detention Center died when the air conditioning failed in a vehicle they were in. In Florida, an officer was suspended without pay in May when he inadvertently left two police dogs in a car at his home.The heat deaths ""happen at a pretty alarming rate,"" said Steve Weiss, an NYPD lieutenant who serves as ODMP's Director of Research. ""I was surprised by how often it happens.""Weiss says that many K9 unit vehicles are now being outfitted with electronic systems that automatically regulate heat and humidity. Some systems can alert remote officers if the AC fails or the temperature gets too high, and allow them to immediately pop the trunk or doors to allow dogs to escape. More widespread adoption of these systems would cut down on the heat exhaustion deaths, according to Weiss.Weiss says better laws protecting police dogs would help too. ""The laws in many states involving the deaths of police animals are not very strict,"" he said. ""Every state is different.""Update: This piece has been updated to reflect that authorities do not currently believe the woman in the apartment, Hasna Aitboulahcen, detonated the suicide vest.",426

Supporters want her at the Maryland State House, too.",Fenit Nirappil,1472078559000,The Washington Post,Maryland Politics,"The student activist who led the successful push to rename the University of Maryland football stadium is trying to jump-start a movement to erect a statue of Harriet Tubman on the grounds of the Maryland State House.The area surrounding the capitol building has long been controversial because it houses a statue of Roger Taney, the Supreme Court justice who authored the proslavery Dred Scott decision.A compromise struck in the mid-1990s kept the Taney statue on the grounds while adding a statue of Thurgood Marshall, the first African American appointed to the nation’s highest court.Legislation that called for placing statues of Tubman and fellow abolitionist Frederick Douglass alongside Taney failed in 2012 and 2013.Colin Byrd, a University of Maryland student who is pushing for the Tubman statue, says he is banking on extra momentum after the Treasury Department decided to put Tubman on $20 bills.Byrd says adding a statue of Tubman to the State House grounds without taking down Taney’s statue should mollify critics who say removing memorials to slavery supporters is tantamount to erasing history.“Even those people would agree a lot of history can be learned from Harriet Tubman’s life and times,” Byrd said. “It’s about balance .?.?. there were two sides to this slavery debate, and Tubman was on the right side of it, while Taney was wrong.”Byrd organized fellow students to push university regents last year to change the name of the school’s football stadium, which had honored segregationist and former university president H.C. “Curley” Byrd.The board voted 12-to-5 in December to change the name of the facility to “Maryland Stadium.”So far, state lawmakers have not signed onto Colin Byrd’s effort to add a Tubman statue outside the State House. But Byrd — who is African American and not related to the long-ago university president — has received high-profile backing from actress Viola Davis, who is playing Tubman in an upcoming HBO biopic.In a statement released by her production company, Davis said Tubman was “an integral part of American history, and it’s time for the masses to truly understand and acknowledge the scope of who she was and what she has accomplished — that, quite bluntly, no man ever has.”Montgomery County Executive Isiah Leggett (D) sent Gov. Larry Hogan (R) a letter this month in support of a Tubman statue. Elected officials in Dorchester County, where Tubman was born, have urged legislative leaders to support the effort.Another attempt by officials in Maryland to honor Tubman fizzled in 2011.Activists, with the support of then-Gov. Martin O’Malley (D), had pushed to replace a statue in the U.S. Capitol of John Hanson — an 18th-century slave owner from southern Maryland who was a member of the Continental Congress — with one of Tubman. A bill requesting the swap did not pass.",804

It can be tempting to export money and equipment to solve the problem. But when bioengineer Rebecca Richards-Kortum visits hospitals in places such as Malawi and El Salvador, she sees the unintended consequence of that charitable impulse.“Ironically, if you walk down the hall or into the basement of a hospital, there’s always a big room that is just for broken, donated equipment,” she says. The equipment works just fine in the United States, but in places plagued by lack of air conditioning, power outages, and challenges like dust and dirt, what would be a high-tech lifesaver in the U.S. is just another hunk of junk. Given the amount of time, energy, space and money that can go into figuring out how to use the equipment and repairing it when it breaks, says Richards-Kortum, “it can hurt more than it helps.”Could there be a better way? Richards-Kortum thinks so — and her efforts to bring affordable, adaptable technology to the world’s poorest places earned her a spot in this year’s class of MacArthur fellows. Richards-Kortum, who heads up Rice University’s Institute for Global Health, uses the latest advances in nanotechnology, fabrication and molecular imaging to help invent equipment that’s rugged enough to stand up to the most challenging clinical conditions and cheap enough to make sense for communities that usually lack access to health care.“Cheaper can certainly be as effective,” says Richards-Kortum. “In some cases it can be better in the sense that it improves access.” Take her high-resolution microscopic endoscope, which her team developed in conditions in countries that have high rates of cervical cancer but low access to things like labs that process pap smears or biopsies. Rather than collect tissue that is then analyzed in a laboratory, the portable endoscope lets technicians view cervical tissue, diagnosing cancer in real time and for less money. And by using new fluorescent dyes developed by Richards-Kortum and her team, doctors can spot oral cancers without spending as much money or time as they would using traditional diagnostics.Resource constraints don’t intimidate Richards-Kortum — they inspire her. “They force you to make really tough decisions,” she says. “I think you often end up with a better product.” She passes on that philosophy to students in Beyond Traditional Borders, a program she developed that teaches undergraduates how to translate classroom ideas into global health solutions. Students focus their efforts not on hypothetical situations, but on real-world problems, developing technologies that fill health needs.For example, a group of her students recently invented an inexpensive bubble CPAP machine for newborns who can’t breathe due to respiratory infections. Developed in conjunction with practitioners in Malawi, the technology decreased mortality rates in one neonatal ward by 46 percent. And patients in developing countries aren’t the only ones who benefit from the program. Students who participate in real-world projects in the program, she says, graduate at higher rates than STEM majors who don’t — especially women and underrepresented minority students.“If your inventions don’t ever leave the lab, you’re not doing your job,” she says. Similarly, she says, inventions that are designed in a vacuum are useless. Rather, she teaches her students to collaborate with end users, clinicians, and patients in the countries they seek to serve. That collaborative process can lead to even more inventive solutions, like a rapid prototyping facility Richards-Kortum helped develop at the University of Malawi. “They came up with a way to locally repair oxygen concentrators,” she says, instead of relying on a pricier, more complex fix.Though Richards-Kortum focuses the majority of her work on finding inexpensive ways to bring healthcare to the developing world, her inventions work the other way, too. She’s currently working to figure out ways to bring her cervical cancer detection system, which is currently being deployed on vans throughout rural Brazil, to under-served places in the United States, like the Rio Grande Valley in Texas.All that penny-pinching has earned Richards-Kortum an honor with a massive $625,000 stipend to use as she pleases. (“I was sure it was a telemarketer, but it turned out to not be a telemarketer,” she jokes of receiving the call from the foundation a few weeks ago.) She isn’t sure yet how she’ll use the money, but she’s committed to using it to improve health for babies and pregnant women in Malawi.“At the current rate of progress, it’s going to be 150 years before a baby who’s born in Africa has the same chance of survival as a baby in North America,” says Richard-Kortum. “I don’t want to live in that world.”Erin Blakemore (@heroinebook) is a freelance journalist from Boulder, Colo.

Initial predictions were dire, but during recent years it’s become clear that the snakehead is just another fish in the river.The snakehead has not destroyed the Potomac River’s ecosystem as first predicted, and it appears that it’s coexisting with the other game fish in the river just fine. According to John Odenkirk, Virginia Department of Game & Inland Fisheries (VDGIF) biologist, the bass population in the Potomac River is better now than in recent years.I interviewed Odenkirk regarding snakeheads in the Potomac River, and his interview, lightly edited, is below:KA: Which section of the Potomac River has the densest population of snakeheads?JO: The areas further downstream (away from D.C.), in newer colonized areas (with suitable habitat), generally will have higher numbers — these will usually be found in the back of tributary arms between Occoquan and Colonial Beach within both Maryland and Virginia. Areas closer to D.C. with higher numbers in Virginia are Aquia Creek (Stafford Co.) and the Occoquan River.KA: During the past few years, has the population of snakeheads increased, decreased, or remained the same in the Potomac River? Has increased fishing pressure helped to reduce the snakehead population?JO: Snakehead abundance increased dramatically after colonization, but trends suggest that increases in abundance may have slowed. Population estimates for Little Hunting Creek (tidal tributary of the Potomac River) declined each year from 2013 to 2015, supporting the assertion that northern snakehead density increases have slowed or that density has stabilized in some creeks.In the areas where they have been longest (e.g., around Mount Vernon), numbers seem to be declining in most Virginia creeks. I am fairly certain that a high level of exploitation (both commercial and recreational), which encompasses the huge increase in bow fishing, due to this fish, has helped suppress numbers.KA: During the past few years, has the population of game fish, such as bass and walleye, increased, decreased, or remained the same in sections of the Potomac River which have snakeheads?JO: We never see walleye in the Virginia portion of the tidal Potomac. This year, the largemouth bass population looks fantastic. On balance, the bass fishery has been better in the past five or six years than longer ago (during early phase of snakehead expansion). In short, it appears both populations are functioning completely independently of one another with no competition (plenty of forage to support both at current levels).KA: Snakeheads are fun to catch and are also delicious to eat. Is there a chance they will ever get reclassified as a game fish, with trophy citations awarded?JO: Maybe someday. Probably citations before game fish status, if it happens.KA: What is the largest or heaviest snakehead documented to have been harvested in the Potomac River?JO: We don’t track those numbers officially, but it’s in the 17- to 18-pound range.KA: Do snakeheads pose more of a risk to the ecosystem of lakes, such as Burke Lake and Lake Brittle, than to the ecosystem of a large river, such as the Potomac?JO: We hope not and should have an answer in a few years, as folks have illegally stocked them in both these VDGIF-owned lakes. We have copious historical data from which to gauge community response. Both lakes are productive (fertile) systems. One concern some folks have is with illegal introductions in less productive systems.KA: When were snakeheads first found in the Potomac River?JO: The fish was first found in the Potomac River in May 2004.",805

We've constructed millions of multi-story, single-family homes where the master bedroom is on the second floor, where the lawn outside requires weekly upkeep, where the mailbox is a stroll away. We've designed neighborhoods where everyday errands require a driver's license. We've planned whole cities where, if you don't have a car, it's not particularly easy to walk anywhere — especially not if you move gingerly.This reality has been a fine one for a younger country. Those multi-story, single-family homes with broad lawns were great for Baby Boomers when they had young families. And car-dependent suburbs have been fine for residents with the means and mobility to drive everywhere. But as the Baby Boomers whose preferences drove a lot of these trends continue to age, it's becoming increasingly clear that the housing and communities we've built won't work very well for the old.A new report from Harvard's Joint Center for Housing Studies and the AARP renews this warning. What will happen to Baby Boomers stuck in suburbia once they can't drive anymore? Where will an aging population with more disabilities live when we've built so little accessible housing? How will they pay for homes late into life when there aren't enough modest-sized homes or aid programs to help afford them?For all of these reasons, we're rapidly approaching a serious clash in America between housing stock and community design on one hand, and demographics on the other.In 1990, less than 5 percent of U.S. counties had a population where adults over 50 made up more than 40 percent of the community (that was 156 counties). By 2010, this was true of 33 percent of all U.S. counties (or 1,031 of them): Harvard JCHS report ""Housing America's Older Adults""Put another way: The U.S. population over age 65 is expected to include 73 million people by 2030 (that's about 33 million more than today). Where do most of these people currently live? In the suburbs:And in single-family homes:Most of those homes don't have the kind of basic ""universal design"" features that older residents will need, like extra-wide hallways, no-step entries, living spaces on the ground floor, or accessible light switches and door levers. The Harvard report cites 2011 American Housing Survey data concluding that just 1 percent of housing units in America have all five of these features.In theory, such adjustments will mean making homes more accessible for everyone: for dads pushing strollers, children on crutches, anyone who just wants a grandparent to visit. But the prospect of age-proofing our housing stock and neighborhoods raises some thorny policy questions: Should communities require private homeowners or commercial builders to incorporate accessibility features? (Some already do.) Are we willing to invest in transit in communities that currently don't have much of it? Can we make room for ""accessory dwelling units"" — like little backyard cottages where grandma might live — that are currently illegal in many cities?And there's another question not raised by the Harvard report, but it's an equally important one that's been voiced by researcher Arthur C. Nelson: If many Baby Boomers wind up leaving the large single-family homes they've long occupied — where they no longer want to mow the lawn or climb the stairs — will there be enough young homeowners wanting to buy them? America is the midst of shifts in both demographics and housing preferences that suggest there may not be.If you are already worried about what an aging America will mean for entitlement programs, health care spending or the labor pool, you should probably add housing to that list, too.",819

What does that mean for female drivers?,Adam Taylor,1464885394000,The Washington Post,WorldViews,"This week the Silicon Valley-based ride-sharing app Uber announced it was getting a huge new injection of funding. But the money wasn't coming from any of the standard investors from the U.S. tech world.Instead, it was coming from Saudi Arabia.The Saudi state's Public Investment Fund (PIF) was putting $3.5 billion into the company, the largest investment in Uber to date. The move has raised eyebrows, however, due to one of the kingdom's most notorious domestic policies: Saudi Arabia is the only country in the world where women cannot legally drive.While the act of driving for women is not specifically banned, various religious edicts in the country have meant women are restricted from applying for a driving license, effectively making the act of driving illegal for Saudi women. While some women in rural areas do drive without licenses anyway and some women with foreign driving licenses occasionally get behind the wheel (a legal gray area used largely in protest), for the most part women in Saudi Arabia simply don't drive. Polls suggest that support for the policy within the country is mixed.Uber, of course, does not deliberately restrict female drivers. At the end of 2015, the company said that only 19 percent of the drivers using the app were women but that it was actively trying to increase that percentage. The Saudi government will now be given a direct say in Uber's decision making process — PIF was given a seat on the board as part of the deal — but a representative of Uber said that the investment would definitely not limit women drivers on the app in the United States or other countries where women are allowed to drive.What's more complicated, however, is the role that Uber already plays in Saudi Arabia's gender politics. While the country's drivers are almost certainly entirely male, Uber's own figures show their Saudi passengers are more than 80 percent female. For many women in the country, the app and its competitors offer a chance at greater autonomy. Public transportation in Saudi Arabia is largely poor, and it can be difficult to find a regular taxi at times. Many families can't afford to hire a driver to take women places on their own.The end result is that if you are a Saudi woman and you want to commute to work or run errands on your own, a ride-sharing app can become an important tool. “There are some [women] that take five to 10 trips with us every day,” Mudassir Sheikha, the founder of local Uber rival Careem told the Los Angeles Times last year. “We don’t see that kind of traffic anywhere.”Uber has acknowledged the role its app plays in the country, usually portraying it as a strength. In December the company offered free Uber rides to Saudi women during the first election in which they were legally allowed to vote.“Of course we think women should be allowed to drive,” Jill Hazelbaker, an Uber spokeswoman, told the New York Times this week. “In the absence of that, we have been able to provide extraordinary mobility that didn’t exist before — and we’re incredibly proud of that.” It's expected now that the Saudi investment in Uber should end lingering questions about the legality of the service in the country.Yet the company could also be accused of providing a reprieve for the Saudi government from dealing with the issues surrounding female drivers in the country. Members of the Saudi royal family have repeatedly suggested that they believe women should be able to drive — Saudi Arabia’s Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, a powerful voice in the country, recently suggested that ""women don’t get their complete rights granted them by Islam.”Yet no real moves toward lifting the restrictions on female drivers have been seen recently. Crown Prince Mohammed said in April that the country was still ""not convinced about women driving.""The problem is likely opposition from the Saudi kingdom's powerful religious community, which largely opposes female drivers. While one cleric infamously suggested that driving could damage women's ovaries, many focus on more practical reasons: What happens if a female driver is pulled over by a male cop? Saudi Arabia's religious customs would find this type of interaction between male and female strangers inappropriate (the interaction between Saudi women and male Uber drivers raises fewer eyebrows because it is transactional in nature). Saudi Arabia has announced its intentions to hire more female police officers, but progress remains slow.Meanwhile, public transport projects are also making slim progress. Riyadh's planned metro station is not slated to open until 2018. And while Uber is an option for some women, for many it's still too expensive for any kind of regular use. Some observers wonder if the eventual end of Saudi Arabia's restrictions on female drivers will come from self-driving cars rather than anything else.The Saudi government gets more complicated still when you consider the broader economic factors at play. Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed has become the figurehead of a widely publicized push (dubbed Saudi Vision 2030) to modernize the Saudi economy and end its ""addiction"" to oil. The hope is to diversify the country's business world, using the country's vast wealth it has accumulated over the years to invest in profitable ventures and focusing on underdeveloped industries like tourism and arms.There's a social component at work here, too, most notably in the significant cuts being made to the subsidies given to Saudi citizens. Female citizens are being encouraged to enter the workforce, with Mohammed stating the aim was to increase their participation from 22 percent to 30 percent by 2030. Such moves may soon put the ruling Saudi royals at odds with the country's religious elite, potentially shattering a partnership that has provided relative stability to the country for decades.The investment in Uber seems to be a sign that the Saudi state is willing to bet big on the country's economic future. How those economic bets will translate socially is hard to predict.More on WorldViewsSaudi Arabia announces plan to end its ‘addiction’ to oilThe facts — and a few myths — about Saudi Arabia and human rightsSaudi Arabia’s ‘Islamic military alliance’ against terrorism makes no senseUpdate: This post has been amended to include comment from an Uber representative who said the Saudi investment would not restrict women drivers on the app in the United States or other countries where women can legally drive.",802

Its presence is a good sign to the scientists who are studying the surrounding forest.It means this section of trees and its vast network of life are still healthy enough to support such a high-order predator. And that, in turn, is at least a small bit of good news for the Earth’s climate.Of all the components of the recent Paris accord on climate change, the one that probably got the least attention but could have the most immediate potential involves the world’s forests. In a section some hailed as historic, the document endorsed a United Nations mechanism for wealthier nations to pay developing countries like Brazil for reducing deforestation.Trees are good at keeping carbon out of the air, and simply preserving the planet’s vast forests is a straightforward way to get a huge head start on the business of slowing climate change. But that effort grows tougher every day. After years of progress, deforestation rates have increased recently in Brazil, and deforestation continues apace across much of the global tropics. The economic forces of agriculture and trade remain too strong to resist.Calls for saving rainforests have a long history, but including forests as a core part of the global climate solution is “very very recent,” said Naoko Ishii, CEO of the Global Environment Facility, an international body that invests in restoring tropical forests. “Without taking care of the forests, it’s going to be just impossible to achieve the Paris agreement.”In fact, recent estimates suggest as much as a third of climate emissions could be offset by stopping deforestation and restoring forest land — and that this solution could be achieved much faster than cuts to fossil fuels.Forests are a crucial “carbon sink,” living engines for absorbing and storing carbon. Tropical forests store the most carbon of all, and no tropical forest on Earth is bigger than the Amazon. It accounts for about half of all the carbon these forests store. But the Brazilian Amazon has lost nearly a fifth of its forest cover already — and the forest left behind also suffers because it is more fragmented and less continuous.Thomas Lovejoy, a George Mason University ecologist, has been studying this section of Amazon for decades. While he was encouraged to see the harpy eagle at its nest on a recent afternoon, he was conscious of the forest’s overall fragility.The Amazon system as a whole, Lovejoy said, is at a “precarious point. And you know, the obvious thing is, you don’t want to find out where the tipping point is by tipping it.”Of trees and warming The forest is protected in this roughly 4-square-mile federal research and conservation plot to the northeast of the city of Manaus, where the dark and acidic Rio Negro meets the more brownish Solimões to form the lower Amazon river, the largest in the world.But not far from here, the smell of smoke still hangs over a recently deforested plot – trees slashed down and then burned. So it has gone throughout the Amazon, and far worse in more southern Brazilian states, such as Pará and Mato Grosso.All of which makes the relentless focus on fossil fuels in the climate discussion – and the consigning of forests, at least until now, to a relative side role – somewhat puzzling. Forests, after all, are almost half carbon (if you leave out the water, that is). The billion year old process of photosynthesis stores carbon in the sugars that, in turn, fuel plant growth and metabolism.The storage of carbon is most intense in tropical forests, where a gigantic abundance of different types of trees, thick vines and epiphytes (plants that grow on other plants) are all fighting one another for a slice of direct tropical sunlight – only a sliver of which actually reaches the forest floor. Trees don’t put down very deep roots here; they stretch them outward across the ground, over a layer of often sandy soil that isn’t even very rich or fertile. If the land is cleared, not only is all the carbon lost to the atmosphere, but the result often isn’t even very good farmland or pasture.Net greenhouse gas emissions due to tropical deforestation and forest degradation are about 8 to 15 percent of the global total, which doesn’t sound like that much. But a recent study in Nature Climate Change found that stopping deforestation could nonetheless be a huge piece of the climate solution. That’s because if tropical deforestation stopped, not only would those emissions go away, but on top of that, forests would start stowing away a significant part of the carbon from our fossil fuel emissions.“One could reduce total CO2 emissions by about 30 percent, just working in the land sector,” said Phil Duffy, president of the Woods Hole Research Center. “And that’s a lot.”Moreover, stopping deforestation could buy precious time to ratchet down fossil fuel emissions. “It’s very hard to suddenly convert everyone to electric cars, and power generation is gradually changing, but it’s going to take decades,” said Paul Salaman, CEO of the Rainforest Trust. “But tropical deforestation can literally be stopped point blank with commitment of countries.”Why a fragmented forest stores less carbon What science is revealing, meanwhile, is that it’s not just deforestation itself that’s the problem – it’s also the damage to what’s left behind.Camp 41, which is run collaboratively by Brazil’s National Institute for Amazonian Research and the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute, is a scientific “control” – an example of what happens when you just leave the rainforest alone and let it grow. By contrast, near here are several forest fragments, which Lovejoy helped preserve for research in the late 1970s after the surrounding land was set to be cleared for ranching.The study of these fragments, which has been ongoing since 1980, shows that the forest left behind in the wake of deforestation also suffers greatly.“This project I think more than any other demonstrated that forest fragmentation in patches was a very, very big problem for nature,” said Harvey Locke, a conservationist and writer who visited Camp 41 with Lovejoy in December. “You never hear anybody seriously arguing now that several little patches are better than a big intact block.”Walking through an isolated, nearly 25-acre forest fragment presents a stunning contrast with the forest near the harpy eagle’s angelim tree. In the intact forest, it’s dark and even relatively cool at the forest floor, a simple function of the fact that trees and vines, crowding upward, have managed to claim nearly all of the sunlight.But in the fragment, direct tropical sunlight penetrates much farther, not only from above but from every side. It’s warmer as a result, and also drier – the layer of fallen leaves on the forest floor isn’t wet and spongy, but crunches and crackles as you walk.This environment sustains less life – animals and plants alike. Spider monkeys, which need to range over a huge area, can’t survive in a fragment like this, Lovejoy said. And they’re one food source for the harpy eagle.“Wherever the forest has been altered or compromised, where hunting has reduced prey items, harpys are one of the first to suffer,” said Bret Whitney, a specialist in Brazilian birds and a research associate at Louisiana State University who guided the recent trip to Camp 41 and identified the harpy eagle. “They really require an intact ecosystem to be out there.”“We know that tree mortality went up in this fragment compared to continuous forest,” Lovejoy said. The forest, when fragmented, “becomes simpler,” he said. Winds also blow down more trees in fragments, Lovejoy’s research suggests, another reason that they store less carbon.The punchline, then, isn’t far from that ",400

The New York Police Department said teams were sent to crowded areas and transit stops “out of an abundance of caution.”“At this time, there is no known indication that the attack has any nexus to New York City. We will continue to follow the situation in Belgium closely with the Joint Terrorism Task Force and the FBI and adjust the department’s deployments accordingly,” police spokesman Stephen P. Davis said in a statement.The United States Department of Homeland Security did not heighten its federal threat level, but advised the public to report suspicious activity. Homeland Security Secretary Jeh C. Johnson said in a statement that “additional security” would be deployed at major city airports and rail and transit stations across the country.New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) directed state officials to step up patrols at heavily traveled locations around the state, including bridges, tunnels, airports and mass transit systems, he said.“Public safety is paramount, and I want the people of this state to know that we are working with all local and federal partners, remaining vigilant and taking all necessary measures to keep New Yorkers safe,” he said in a statement.At JFK International Airport, New York National Guard forces were providing additional security detail. The Guard deployed 400 service members across the New York City area Tuesday, Cuomo said. They focused increased patrols on transportation hubs such as JFK and LaGuardia Airports. In addition, New York State Troopers were monitoring Penn Station and Grand Central Station as well as the Queens-Midtown Tunnel and George Washington Bridge. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey stepped up its police presence at airports, bridges, tunnels and the World Trade Center complex, Cuomo said. And the Metropolitan Transit Auhtority was upping patrols across the system.In Washington, Metro Transit Police advised passengers to remain vigilant. The agency said it would conduct additional K9 sweeps and patrols across the system Tuesday morning as a precaution, but that no “known, specific or credible threat” existed. Alexandria Deputy Police Chief Shahram Fard said in a Tweet that Alexandria Police patrol officers were assisting Metro Transit Police in monitoring Metro parking lots, and it was expected that agencies across the region would aid in the security effort.Internationally, the attacks led to the cancellation of hundreds of flights — mostly in and out of Brussels Airport — which closed Tuesday. Brussels Airlines had cancelled 203 flights by Tuesday afternoon, according to the Flight tracking website flightaware.com.On U.S. airlines, the site said, flights with Brussels on their itinerary were canceled. They included: A United Airlines flight bound for Dulles International Airport that was scheduled to leave Brussels at 7:10 a.m. Eastern Time on Tuesday, along with three other United flights; six Delta Airlines flights and two American Airlines flights — one bound for Philadelphia and another departing from there for the Belgian capital.American Airlines spokesman Kent Powell said the airline has made accommodations for passengers with reservations to Brussels, and arrangements would be made for those who remain in Belgium. Flights to and from Brussels were canceled through Thursday, he said. American’s next flight to Brussels is scheduled to depart Philadelphia on Friday evening, while its next flight from Brussels back to the U.S. is scheduled to leave the Belgian capital at 9:40 Saturday morning.“American Airlines is taking care of our employees and customers in Brussels after this morning’s events. At this time, there are no reported injuries to our employees. American Airlines check-in operates at Row 8 of the departure hall, and the explosions did not occur at Row 8,” Powell said. “American Airlines flight 751 from Brussels to Philadelphia has been canceled for today. When operations at the Brussels airport resume, we will reaccommodate our customers. We have issued a travel policy for customers with reservations to Brussels who wish to change their itineraries.”The Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority did not outline specific steps that were being taken at the region’s two major airports, Dulles International and Reagan National airports, but a statement reinforced the airports’ commitment to passenger safety. The statement encouraged passengers to stay vigilant and report any unusual activity.“Reagan National and Dulles International airports have a robust security structure, both publicly visible and behind the scenes,” the statement read. “We constantly train our employees and evaluate our security procedures, in collaboration with our federal partners and local mutual aid partners, to make adjustments, updates and enhancements based on new information and situations.”Officials at Baltimore Washington International Airport said they were “working closely” with federal and state law enforcement agencies after the Brussels attacks, but that no specific threat existed.Maryland officials said Tuesday that travelers should expect to see more police and canine explosive detection patrols throughout the state’s transportation network.“In the wake of the horrific attacks today in Belgium, we are taking every precaution to keep Maryland citizens safe and secure,” Gov. Larry Hogan (R) said in a statement. “In particular, there will be a more visible law enforcement presence at the airport, train stations and other mass transit locations around the state. I encourage all Marylanders, especially those traveling, to remain vigilant and aware of their surroundings at all times. If you see something unusual or unsettling, please report it immediately.”Transportation Secretary Pete K. Rahn said two pre-established law enforcement plans for the MTA Police and the Maryland Transportation Authority Police would be implemented.“In addition to the increased enforcement you do see, there are many measures in place that travelers won’t see,” Rahn said. “Please be aware of your surroundings and remember: ‘If you see something, say something.’ ”In Chicago, extra officers and canine units were dispatched to the airports and Chicago Transit Authority stations stations as a precaution, the Chicago Tribune reported. A police spokesman told the paper that the interim police superintendent has ordered “stepped-up presence at airports and transportation sites within Chicago.”In Los Angeles, the county sheriff’s transit police swept Union Station, the downtown train station, and heightened security at other transit hubs, according to the Los Angeles Times. Security would be increased at several of the city’s major metro stations, a spokesman told the paper.At Los Angeles International Airport, officers would be making their presence known more than usual, an airport police officer told the paper.And in San Francisco, there would be an increased uniform police presence at “key locations” across the Bay Area Rapid Transit system, said spokeswoman Alicia Trost. The system was also sending out a “See Something, Say Something” memo to passengers through its safety and security app BART Watch.Lori Aratani and Ashley Halsey III contributed to this post.",341

Lin,1472713234000,The Washington Post,WorldViews,"It's a big year for women in politics.In a historic first, Hillary Clinton was named the Democratic Party’s presidential nominee in the upcoming U.S. elections. If she wins, she will join Theresa May of Britain and Angela Merkel of Germany in the ranks of women who lead prominent Western democracies.They're not alone, either. In recent years, the number of women holding positions in both parliament and executive government has grown. As of June 2016, women’s membership in parliament doubled from 11.3 percent in 1995 to 22.1 percent in 2015, according to a recent study by the Inter-Parliamentary Union.And this year alone, there have been many historic firsts.In Iran, women won 17 seats during the Islamic Republic’s parliamentary elections in February. “This is a record and we are happy that our dear women are taking part in all stages, especially in politics,” Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said in a speech back in May.Africa has had some of the most dramatic breakthroughs over the past 20 years. As of June, four African nations were part of the top 10 as far as the number of women represented in parliament. Rwanda, for example, tops the chart as the country with the highest number of women represented in parliament in both the lower (63.8 percent) and upper houses (38.5 percent) in 2016.But women remain a relatively small group in parliaments around the world, and progress is slow. Data from the IPU shows that in a vast majority of countries, men still dominate the political stage. In both the lower and upper houses combined, women around the world account for around 22 percent of seats held in parliament.""Yes it is an improvement considering that it started at a low base,"" Executive Director of U.N. Women Phumzile Mlambo Ngcuka said. ""But if we continue at this pace, it's going to take us too long. We need to fast-track the attainment of gender equality.""The U.S. is one country that lags the global average of women in the national legislature. It ranks behind 95 countries, including low- and middle-income countries such as Ethiopia, El Salvador and Suriname. Other countries that outperform the United States include Iraq, Afghanistan and Saudi Arabia.One way that countries have been fast-tracking female participation in politics is through gender quotas, and the results have left many surprised. Countries that that have relatively low socioeconomic development or have just emerged from conflict, such as Afghanistan, Tanzania and Ecuador, have shown tremendous improvement and have higher levels of female representation in parliaments.Jennifer Rosen, assistant professor of sociology at Pepperdine University, says emerging democracies give leaders a unique opportunity for leaders to enshrine gender quotas in their new constitutions, helping bypass cultural barriers that would have otherwise stood in the way of women participating in politics for many years.Different electoral systems also influence women's participation in parliament. While scholars agree that proportional representation systems, which allow people to vote for a party list rather than a particular candidate, have a positive influence on female representation in government, some are divided as to whether it has a positive impact on all countries or only on Western democracies.One way for countries to shift their mentalities is to encourage people in executive leadership positions to set an example, Rosen said. Ngcuka, the U.N. women executive director, agrees and said men play an important role and that women shouldn't be the only ones trying to ""move the glass ceiling,"" noting how attitudes change when influential leaders such as Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau nominated a cabinet in 2015 that was half-female.Political parties that are supposed to provide gender quotas need to ensure that they place women in winnable positions, IPU Secretary General Martin Chungong said. ""In many instances they are not walking the walk,"" he said. ""It's not enough to have quotas. We need to provide incentives for people who don't want to implement them.""What's also clear is that having women in national legislatures can change the way a country is governed. Research shows that when women participate in politics, the conversation gets steered toward issues that their male counterparts often fail to address, such as family planning, education and gender-based violence.""We have seen that there are certain issues women are better able to articulate,"" Chungong said. ""Women tend to take leading roles not because it is a women's issue, but because it has to do with livelihood of society as a whole.""

Adams,1390251961000,The Washington Post,Health & Science,"We’ve all heard the complaint or something like it: “I’ve been staring at the screen all day. My eyes hurt.” But is it really the screen’s fault? (And if so, is there any long- or short-term damage?) Would our eyes be any better off perusing printed pages all day?Yes, you can blame the screen, but not for everything. Some of the same eye-care advice you’ll hear for computer screens apply to paper-bookworms, too.Screen-induced eye strain has an official name, if not a surprising one: computer vision syndrome. The term emerged about 20 years ago and describes a host of bothersome symptoms, including eye fatigue, burning and itchy eyes, blurred vision and sensitivity to bright light. People who spend two or more continuous hours at a computer every day are at greatest risk for developing the syndrome, according to the American Optometric Association.For most people, symptom treatment is enough — managing their reading position, taking rest breaks or using eye drops to relieve dry eyes. That said, dry and irritated eyes are associated with disorders of the cornea, the transparent layer at the front of the eye. See a doctor if you’re putting drops in your eyes five or six times a day and still feel like they’re dry, says James Salz, a University of Southern California eye doctor and spokesperson for the American Academy of Ophthalmology. Still, he adds, “there’s no evidence that there’s any long-term damage from reading on a screen.”What is it about computers that irritates our eyes? The problem boils down to a couple of key factors:Blinking. Study after study has found that when reading on screens people tend to stare more than they do when reading on a printed page. More staring means less blinking, which means your eyes get less refreshment from tears. “When you blink, you spread a layer of tears over the eye,” says Mark Rosenfield, a professor at the State University of New York College of Optometry. With less blinking, eyes get dry and sore.Another difference between the printed page and the computer screen is where the words are positioned relative to the eyes. People generally look down while reading a book or newspaper, but staring at screen usually means staring straight ahead. When you look down, more of your eye is covered by the eyelid, but when you look straight ahead more of your eye is exposed to the drying effect of air. Coupled with reduced blinking, this leads to dry eyes. Reading on mobile devices may be more book-like in terms of positioning, but blink rate is still a concern.A small 2013 study found that when reading print on paper or e-ink (the technology that attempts to replicate as closely as possible the printed page experience, Kindle paperwhite in this study), the subjects — 12 men who read for at least an hour on each device — blinked more often when reading on paper or e-ink than they did when looking at an LCD screen (a tablet with its own light supply, the Kindle Fire here). Participants also reported more visual fatigue after reading on the LCD; fatigue rates on e-ink and paper were equivalent. Distance. Not surprisingly, people reading on their smartphones tend to hold the device much closer to their eyes than they would a book or magazine. In a 2011 study, Rosenfield found that the 219 participants held their phones 14 inches from their eyes to read text messages and 12?1 / 2 inches for a Web page. Typically, people read printed text from a distance of 15?3 / 4 inches.The result is that “your eye has to work much harder to focus at close distances,” Rosenfield says. The eyes turn in more (not quite cross-eyed) and that takes effort. Over time, that can lead to fatigue.Moreover, if you’re of a certain age, that focusing effort becomes even harder. At about age 40, natural changes in the eye’s focal length means most people can’t see closely as well. That’s when you start holding the restaurant menu at an arm’s length to read.Other considerations are resolution, brightness, and glare, says Alan Hedge, a professor of ergonomics at Cornell University. “The resolution of print on paper is higher than any screen out there.” Brightness should be adjusted for comfort, either on your screen or the lamp by your reading chair. As for glare, it is easier to read a book or an e-ink on an e-reader in the sunshine. But if you’re reading late at night in bed, you might prefer the backlit screen of a tablet.The good thing about electronic reading is that you can change so many things to make the experience more comfortable, such as increasing the size of the text and fiddling with the brightness, which can also help you keep the words at a distance. Salz says 18 inches is ideal.Common sense goes a long way too, Salz says. “As soon as you feel fatigue, look away.”Indeed, workplace advice for people who read on computers for a large part of their days, comes in the 20-20-20 rule: Every 20 minutes, look 20 feet away for 20 seconds.So good for us: A new excuse to gaze out the window.",350

The Joint Typhoon Warning Center estimates that Typhoon Vongfong has maximum winds of 155 mph on Tuesday morning, though this is likely a conservative estimate.Vongfong is now the sixth super typhoon of 2014, with winds speeds over 150 mph.The Joint Typhoon Warning Center points to a favorable environment for the cause of the rapid intensification, including low wind shear and excellent outflow, which helps to ventilate and strengthen the storm.Forecast models are suggesting that the super typhoon could continue to intensify, tanking to 895 millibars — a typhoon intensity not seen since Typhoon Haiyan in 2013, which killed over 6,000 people. A pressure that low would beat this year’s second most intense storm — Typhoon Genevieve — by 20 millibars.Luckily, this monster storm is not expected to make landfall while it’s at such high intensity. Over the next 24 to 48 hours, Vongfong is forecast to make a sharp turn north toward Japan. By Saturday morning, the typhoon is forecast to weaken to the equivalent of a category three, and then a category two with wind speeds of 105 mph, as it approaches the southern islands of the Kagoshima Prefecture of Japan.Beyond this, global forecast models are suggesting Vongfong will continue to turn northeast and potentially making landfall in the southern Japan mainland, which will undoubtedly bring torrential rain to a region already soaked from Typhoon Phanfone.",408

Ferdman,1460725153000,The Washington Post,Wonkblog,"This story and its headline have been been updated, with ""alarming"" being changed to ""striking."" See below for more details.Critics of the fast-food industry have long warned about the perils of our addiction to processed food. Big Macs and Whoppers might taste good, but put too many of them in your body and it will expand as Violet Beauregard's did in Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory (although maybe not quite as fast). The evidence is decades in the making. The rise of processed food, after all, has coincided with an alarming growth in the size of our collective gut.But there might be some new powerful ammunition for those who could do without the food the fast-food industry serves.Researchers at George Washington University have linked fast-food consumption to the presence of potentially harmful chemicals, a connection they argue could have ""great public health significance."" Specifically, the team found that people who eat fast food tend to have significantly higher levels of certain phthalates, which are commonly used in consumer products such as soap and makeup to make them less brittle but have been linked to a number of adverse health outcomes, including higher rates of infertility, especially among males.The danger, the researchers believe, isn't necessarily a result of the food itself, but rather the process by which the food is prepared. The findings were published in Environmental Health Perspectives, a journal funded by the National Institutes of Health.""We're not trying to create paranoia or anxiety, but I do think our findings are alarming,"" said one of the study's authors, Ami Zota, an assistant professor of environmental and occupational health at George Washington University. ""It's not every day that you conduct a study where the results are this strong.""(Update: A few hours after publication, Zota called to say that in reading her quote she felt that the word ""alarming"" was too strong a word to use to describe her findings. Rather, she said ""striking"" was more appropriate, because it conveys the magnitude of the findings without assigning a sense of urgency.)Fast-food nationIn order to gauge how fast food affects the presence of certain non-natural chemicals, the team analyzed data for nearly 9,000 people. The data was collected as part of federal nutrition surveys conducted between 2003 and 2010. The surveys included detailed information about the participants' diets, including what each had eaten in the last 24 hours. They also contained the results of urine samples taken at the same time, which allowed the researchers to measure the levels of three separate chemicals.For the purpose of the study, any food eaten at or from restaurants without waiters or waitresses was considered fast food. Everything else — food eaten at sit-down restaurants and bars or purchased from supermarkets and vending machines — was not.The first thing the researchers found was that roughly one-third of the participants said they had eaten some form of fast food over the course of the day leading up to the urine sample collection. That proportion, high as it might seem, is actually in line with government estimates. In fact, more than a third of all children and adolescents living in the country still eat some form of fast food on any given day, a number that hasn't budged in decades, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.The second thing the researchers found is that those participants who said they had eaten fast food in the last 24 hours tended to have much higher levels of two separate phthalates — DEHP and DiNP. People who reported eating only a little fast food had DEHP levels that were 15.5 percent higher and DiNP levels that were 25 percent higher than those who said they had eaten none. For people who reported eating a sizable amount, the increase was 24 percent and 39 percent, respectively.And the connection held true even after the researchers adjusted for various factors about the participants' habits and backgrounds that might have contributed to the association between fast-food consumption and phthalate levels.""We looked at it in so many different ways, and the effect still remains,"" said Zota.The problem with these chemicalsThere is little consensus on the harms of phthalates, which are widely used in commerce and give materials such as food packaging added flexibility, except that exposure to them ""is widespread."" But there is growing concern that the chemicals could pose a variety of risks, particularly when observed in the sort of levels seen in the study.""There's a vast amount of scientific evidence suggesting certain phthalates can contribute to several adverse health effects,"" said Zota.A 2012 study found a strong association between the presence of DEHP and diabetes. A 2013 study found that exposure to the industrial chemical can increase the risk of various allergic diseases in children. And a 2016 study concluded that it can also negatively affect child behavior.While there is less evidence that DiNP is problematic, some recent research suggests it very well could be. A study undertaken last year, for instance, found that exposure to the phthalate was associated with higher blood pressure.For these reasons, many governments have moved to limit exposure to the industrial chemicals. Japan disallowed the use of vinyl gloves in food preparation for fear that their use was compromising health. The European Union, which limits the use of the chemical, has been nudging manufacturers to replace it. And the United States restricted its use in toys. In fact, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services warned that DEHP is ""reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen.""To fear or not to fearThe reason people who eat fast food seem to have much higher levels of potentially harmful industrial chemicals is unclear. But it's easy enough to guess: the sheer amount of processing that goes into food served at quick-service restaurants.The more machinery, plastic, conveyor belts, and various forms of processing equipment that food touches, the more likely the food is to contain higher levels of phthalates. And fast food tends to touch a good deal more of these things than, say, the food one purchases at a local farmers market.""I really hope this study helps raise public awareness about the exposure problems associated with our industrialized food system,"" said Zota.Considering the prevalence of packaged food — and widespread exposure to phthalates (they can be detected in more than 98 percent of the population, per the CDC) — however, the takeaway isn't necessarily that fast food is toxic. Fast food, after all, isn't the only culprit here. Nor are less healthful things in general.""It’s not fair to say, 'Oh, these exposures only happen if you eat unhealthy foods,'"" Leo Trasande, an associate professor of pediatrics, environmental medicine and population health at New York University, told Bloomberg.Anything that's gone through some form of processing or industrial packaging is vulnerable.Still, given the new study's findings, it certainly seems as though eating fast food is more toxic than avoiding it, and not for the obvious reasons. Perhaps that's something many would have expected to hear, but it doesn't make it any less true.""Traditional fast food was never meant to be daily fare, and it shouldn’t be,"" said Marion Nestle, who is the Paulette Goddard professor of nutrition and food Studies at New York University. ""It’s too high in calories and salt and, as we now know, the chemicals that get into our food supply through industrial food production.""Like our Health & Wellness page on Facebook for more science news about the ins and outs of the human body and mind, essays and advice.

A Goldman spokesman says the firm has not traded RINs for itself or on behalf of clients. This version has been corrected.The “now hiring” sign is up online for Emmetsburg, Iowa, where the nation’s largest maker of ethanol used for motor fuel is putting the final touches on a manufacturing plant that will rely not on corn, but on the stalks and cobs left behind.The company, Poet, is looking for an accountant, electricians, lab technicians, a supervisor for starch and cellulose operations, and more. Large flatbed trucks have already dropped off 2,600 tons of big bales at the distillery’s 22-acre stack yard. Equipment is visible from miles away across the flat, open prairie. The process is a bit like making moonshine on an industrial scale, helped along by some high-tech, bioengineered enzymes.“My gosh, it’s been a boon for everybody,” said Myrna Heddinger, a retired nurse serving her third term as the mayor of Emmetsburg, a town of 3,500 people that has squeezed in 500 temporary construction workers. “We just don’t have that many places for people to rent to stay,” she added.Poet and its joint venture partner, the Dutch industrial giant and enzyme maker DSM, have received $100 million in Energy Department grants and $20 million in financial incentives from the state of Iowa. They say they expect to begin production of ethanol at the Emmetsburg plant in early 2014, at a rate of about 20 million gallons a year.Not a moment too soon. For months, a brawl has been brewing in Washington over the future of ethanol plants like this one, pitting well-financed oil giants against trade groups and companies representing the politically well-connected biofuel industry.The heart of the dispute is the Energy Independence and Security Act passed by Congress in 2007 with rare bipartisan support. The law provided a road map for increasing the use of renewable agricultural byproducts in the U.S. motor fuel supply. The Poet plant is just what Congress envisioned, a Middle America biofuel displacing Middle East crude — with some possible climate benefits to boot.Corn-based ethanol, which makes up nearly 10 percent of U.S. motor fuel, has been in large-scale production for years. But Congress was worried about driving up the price of corn used as feed for livestock and poultry. So lawmakers capped the total production of corn-based ethanol and set a schedule for ramping up the use of “advanced” biofuels made from corn husks, switch grass, wood chips and other stuff known as “cellulosic” material to 16 billion gallons by 2022.There’s one problem, though: So far, no company has produced cellulosic ethanol at commercial volumes.A slower-than-expected startCongress assumed that it could be phased in gradually, but not this gradually. This year refiners were supposed to mix about one billion gallons of it into motor fuel. So far, there has been hardly a drop. More than a dozen companies have tried and failed to find a profitable formula combining sophisticated enzymes and the mundane but costly and labor-intensive job of collecting biomass.Congress had the foresight to provide a safety valve. The Environmental Protection Agency, using its authority under the 2007 law, slashed the cellulosic ethanol quota this year, first to a paltry 14 million gallons and then again to 6 million, equal to about 0.004 percent of the fuel consumed by U.S. automobiles. It also extended the deadline for compliance. The EPA is widely expected to announce minimal quotas for next year soon, too. Oil industry lobbyists believe the EPA will also, for the first time, trim the minimum quotas for corn-based ethanol, angering farm interests and big corn-ethanol producers.The shortfall in cellulosic ethanol output has helped trigger high costs for some oil refiners under an arcane enforcement scheme that has the oil industry screaming — and lobbying — for congressional and regulatory relief. Ashley M. Smith, vice president for investor relations for Valero, the nation’s biggest oil refiner, said during an Oct. 29 conference call with analysts that the company expects to spend $500 million to $600 million this year to buy certificates to comply with the program.The American Petroleum Institute, a trade group for the nation’s oil and gas industry, says that petroleum refiners shouldn’t have to wait for the EPA to amend the targets every year. It wants the mandates — known as the Renewable Fuel Standard — abolished so that refiners don’t pay penalties for failing to comply. The API has wallpapered billboards, Web sites and subway systems with ads. It has lobbied key members of Congress. And it has filed a lawsuit against what it called an “unrealistic mandate.”“Our bottom line is that the RFS must be stopped once and for all,” said Bob Greco, API’s director of upstream and industry operations. He said the standard was “simply broken.”William R. Klesse, chief executive of Valero, which is also the nation’s third-largest cornethanol producer, wrote to EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy in September saying that cellulosic ethanol “is still basically nonexistent with only small volumes expected.” He said Congress “should develop an alternate RFS that encourages the development of the business, but also represents the real world.”The ethanol industry has fired back that the oil companies’s real agenda is to prevent a new industry from competing for space in American fuel tanks. They charge that oil firms fear losing even a 1 percent share of the roughly $450 billion-a-year gasoline market, especially since U.S. gasoline consumption peaked in 2005 and has been falling as a result of higher fuel-efficiency standards for new American cars.“We would never have invested the amount of money we’ve done without a clear framework like the one the RFS is providing. It is absolutely critical,” said Manuel Sánchez Ortega, the chief executive of Spanish engineering giant Abengoa, which is finishing a cellulosic ethanol plant in Hugoton, Kan. Repealing the RFS, he added, “would be somehow misleading to the investment community.”Rep. John Shimkus (R-Ill.), a senior member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, is one target of lobbying groups. The goals set by Congress in 2007 were “just too aggressive,” he said during a September meeting with reporters organized by Platts, an energy newsletter. But, he added, “there are people who’ve made major investments. You’re talking billions of dollars. .?.?. So what kind of signal are you sending” by changing the RFS? “That kind of scares me,” he said.The industry takes offThe fight is coming to a head just as the first well-financed, truly commercial-size cellulosic ethanol plants are poised to come onstream. These ventures, while behind schedule, aren’t start-ups, and the companies behind them have the financial muscle to push ahead. Dupont is close to completing a plant in the town of Nevada, Iowa, that will produce 30 million gallons a year. Abengoa, the Spanish multinational energy, engineering and construction firm with more than 22,000 employees worldwide, says its Kansas plant will start up by early next year and produce 25 million gallons a year. It has been signing 10-year contracts with farmers within a 50-mile radius to buy biomass.Poet and DSM expect to begin production in Emmetsburg in early 2014 at a rate of about 20 million gallons a year. Poet, which is the country’s biggest corn-based ethanol producer, has worked on cellulosic technology since 2001. The plant is located next to a Poet corn-ethanol plant, so that it can draw on the same farmers for raw material.“You’ve got $1 billion plus of investment in steel, and people don’t put that kind of money in just for fun,” said Adam Monroe, president of Novozymes America, the subsidiary of a Danish company that makes enzymes used to convert plant",825

Miller,1437553509000,The Washington Post,Morning Mix,"It was a driver’s worst nightmare.Andy Greenberg was speeding along a busy interstate in St. Louis recently when he suddenly lost control of his vehicle. The accelerator abruptly stopped working. The car crawled to a stop. As 18-wheelers whizzed by his stalled vehicle, Greenberg began to panic.His car hadn’t spun out on black ice, however. It hadn’t been hit by another vehicle or experienced engine trouble.It had been hacked.[Hacks on the highway: Automakers rush to add wireless features, leaving our cars open to hackers]Greenberg, a senior writer for Wired magazine, had asked Charlie Miller and Chris Valasek — two “white hat” or altruistic hackers — to show him what they could do.So, while Greenberg drove down the highway, Miller and Valasek sat on Miller’s couch 10 miles away and played God.“Though I hadn’t touched the dashboard, the vents in the Jeep Cherokee started blasting cold air at the maximum setting, chilling the sweat on my back through the in-seat climate control system,” Greenberg wrote. “Next the radio switched to the local hip hop station and began blaring Skee-lo at full volume. I spun the control knob left and hit the power button, to no avail. Then the windshield wipers turned on, and wiper fluid blurred the glass.“As I tried to cope with all this, a picture of the two hackers performing these stunts appeared on the car’s digital display: Charlie Miller and Chris Valasek, wearing their trademark track suits. A nice touch, I thought.”The situation stopped being funny, however, when the two hackers cut the engine.“Seriously, this is f—– dangerous. I need to move,” Greenberg said, pleading for the hackers to return power to the vehicle.Greenberg survived to tell his tale, of course, but the ordeal is just the latest in a series of incidents highlighting the startling security vulnerabilities of hundreds of thousands of American automobiles.These incidents have raised the specter of remote-controlled car accidents, in which anarchist hackers or computer-savvy assassins could still be at home in their pajamas while wreaking havoc.On Tuesday, just hours after Wired published its story, Sens. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) and Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) unveiled a bill aimed at keeping Internet-connected cars from getting hacked.“Rushing to roll out the next big thing, automakers have left cars unlocked to hackers and data-trackers,” Blumenthal said.“Controlled demonstrations show how frightening it would be to have a hacker take over controls of a car,” Markey said in a statement to Wired. “Drivers shouldn’t have to choose between being connected and being protected…We need clear rules of the road that protect cars from hackers and American families from data trackers.”[Next dashboard warning may be, ‘Your car has been hacked!’]Even the hackers themselves were taken aback by their abilities.“When I saw we could do it anywhere, over the Internet, I freaked out,” Valasek told Wired. “I was frightened. It was like, holy f—, that’s a vehicle on a highway in the middle of the country. Car hacking got real, right then.” The problem is one of our own creation.Like thousands of other everyday devices, from coffeemakers to power plants, cars are increasingly connected to the Internet. This enables drivers to stream music, watch videos and use GPS.But it also exposes their cars — and therefore the drivers as well — to hackers.Miller and Valasek exploited a weak spot in Uconnect, an Internet-connected feature on as many as 471,000 Fiat Chrysler late-model automobiles, most of them in the United States. Using a laptop computer and a burner phone, they were able to send a series of commands to the car.“Uconnect computers are linked to the Internet by Sprint’s cellular network, and only other Sprint devices can talk to them,” Greenberg explained. By connecting a phone to his laptop, Miller was able to use the phone as a Wi-Fi hot spot and search Sprint’s entire 3G network for hack-able cars.[Hackers warned senators of the Internet’s vulnerabilities back in 1998, but were ignored]Not only does the computer weakness allow hackers to manipulate the locks and turn off the engine, it also enables them to cut the brakes. They can even take over the steering wheel if the car is in reverse.“From an attacker’s perspective, it’s a super nice vulnerability,” Miller told Greenberg.The stunt seems to confirm fears that have worried security experts for several years now. In 2011, researchers at the University of Washington and the University of California at San Diego proved they could remotely disable a car’s locks and brakes.While the researchers didn’t reveal the car manufacturer, Miller and Valasek have made no secret that their hack affects cars made by Fiat Chrysler.Before going public with the news, however, the hackers took their findings to the company. Chrysler has recently released a patch to prevent such hacking.“[Fiat Chrysler Automobiles] has a program in place to continuously test vehicles systems to identify vulnerabilities and develop solutions,” the company said in a statement sent to WIRED. “FCA is committed to providing customers with the latest software updates to secure vehicles against any potential vulnerability.”“Patch your Chrysler vehicle before hackers kill you,” warned Fox News on Wednesday after Wired published its article.Thanks to Miller and Valasek, Chrysler drivers can now guard against such invasions. But the Uconnect weakness is only the tip of an Internet security iceberg. There are many other ways that a car can be compromised by hackers.Other brands, for example, might not be any safer.“I don’t think there are qualitative differences in security between vehicles today,” UCSD computer science professor Stefan Savage told Wired. “The Europeans are a little bit ahead. The Japanese are a little bit behind. But broadly writ, this is something everyone’s still getting their hands around.”In February, hackers demonstrated to NBC 4 in New York how they could override a car’s system using a tiny Wi-Fi dongle plugged underneath its steering wheel.[FBI probe of alleged plane hack sparks worries over flight safety]Other successful attacks have involved “infecting the computers in the repair shop and then having that infection spread to the car through the diagnostic port, or hacking in through the Bluetooth system, or using the telematics unit that’s normally used to provide roadside assistance,” Kathleen Fisher from the federal Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), told NBC.Car makers have been slow to respond to criticism from researchers or hackers like Miller and Valasek.“There is a clear lack of appropriate security measures to protect drivers against hackers who may be able to take control of a vehicle or against those who may wish to collect and use personal driver information,” according to a study compiled by Markey and released in February.The study, “Tracking & Hacking: Security & Privacy Gaps Put American Drivers at Risk,” found, among other things, that:Nearly 100% of cars on the market include wireless technologies that could pose vulnerabilities to hacking or privacy intrusions. Most automobile manufacturers were unaware of or unable to report on past hacking incidents. Security measures to prevent remote access to vehicle electronics are inconsistent and haphazard across all automobile manufacturers, and many manufacturers did not seem to understand the questions posed by Senator Markey. Only two automobile manufacturers were able to describe any capabilities to diagnose or meaningfully respond to an infiltration in real-time, and most say they rely on technologies that cannot be used for this purpose at all.The security shortcomings exposed by Miller, Valasek and others are especially worrying as fully automated cars appear on the horizon.Imagine laying back in your fully automated car on your way to work when someone at a Starbucks miles away takes control and sends your robotic car swerving into oncoming traffic",811

Individuals should eat as little dietary cholesterol as possible.""Cholesterol warnings have been around in the United States since at least 1961 and have helped shift eating habits from foods like eggs. But scientific thinking on the issue has evolved.Nutritionists now believe that foods high in cholesterol may not significantly affect cholesterol levels or increase the risk of heart disease in healthy adults. But individuals with health issues such as diabetes should continue to avoid cholesterol-rich foods.The government's new stance on dietary cholesterol is in line with that of other nations, which do not single out cholesterol as an issue. Yet it should not be confused with officials' continued warning about high levels of ""bad"" cholesterol in the blood -- something that has been clearly linked to heart disease.Experts emphasize that while the hard limit on cholesterol consumption was removed, that doesn't mean a green light to eat cholesterol-laden foods with abandon.""Cautions about cholesterol intake are addressed in the text of the [guideline] report, including a clear statement that people do not need to obtain cholesterol through food and should limit their intake of cholesterol and saturated fat as much as possible through healthy eating patterns,"" American College of Cardiology President Kim Allan Williams said.[Cholesterol in the Diet: The Long Slide from Public Menace to No “Appreciable” Effect]Williams explained that Americans can meet these recommendations by eating more unprocessed foods -- especially fruits, vegetables and whole grains -- and by replacing unwanted sugar and fat with plant-based foods, including whole grains, fruits and vegetables.The federal government's influential Dietary Guidelines for Americans, which were released Thursday, are updated every five years, and the debate over saturated fats, red meat, caffeine and salt was especially intense this time around.The guidelines are the basis of everything from school lunch programs to the diets promoted in bestselling books, but in recent years some scientists have begun to question the one-size-fits-all approach. A growing body of research supports the theory that a person's genetic makeup or microbiome (the organisms that live on or inside of you and help to make you who you are) plays a key role in how food affects the body -- and that the impact can be different from one individual to another.

a36fa8a2-8962-11e6-bff0-d53f592f176e,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/post-reporter-jason-rezaian-and-his-family-f,Post reporter Jason Rezaian and his family file federal lawsuit against Iranian government,Carol Morello,1475509053000,The Washington Post,National Security,"Washington Post reporter Jason Rezaian and his family filed a federal lawsuit Monday against the Iranian government, claiming he was taken hostage and psychologically tortured during his 18 months in prison in an effort by Tehran to influence negotiations for a nuclear agreement with Iran.The suit, filed in U.S. District Court in the District of Columbia, says Rezaian was targeted for arrest to gain advantage in a prisoner exchange and to “extort” concessions from the U.S. government in the multinational talks over lifting sanctions if Iran agreed to limits on its nuclear program.Iranian officials repeatedly told Rezaian and his wife, Yeganeh Salehi, who also was detained for more than two months, that Rezaian had “value” as a bargaining chip for a prisoner swap, the suit says. The filing also links key moments in the nuclear negotiations to Rezaian’s treatment in the judicial system, from arrest to conviction to sentencing, and ultimately his release on the day the deal was implemented.“For nearly eighteen months, Iran held and terrorized Jason for the purpose of gaining negotiating leverage and ultimately exchanging him with the United States for something of value to Iran,” the suit states.Rezaian; his brother, Ali Rezaian; and their mother, Mary Rezaian, are asking for an unspecified sum for damages under the “terrorism exception” to the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act. That law generally bars U.S. citizens from suing foreign governments in domestic courts, but exceptions are made for terrorist acts, torture or hostage-taking by countries, including Iran, that the State Department has designated as state sponsors of terrorism. The suit accuses Iran of all three.Rezaian and Salehi, who was born in Iran and married Rezaian there, were arrested on July 22, 2014, by Iranian agents wearing surgical masks who forced their way into the couple’s apartment and took them for questioning at Evin prison, a notorious site for political prisoners. Salehi was freed 71 days later on a $32,000 bail provided by her brother-in-law, Ali.Rezaian was eventually tried and convicted on espionage and related charges, according to Iranian state media accounts. But the Iranian government has never officially disclosed the specifics of his conviction in a closed-door trial or the sentence imposed by a judge known for meting out harsh punishments.The lawsuit provides details of Rezaian’s incarceration that had never before been publicly revealed.Both Rezaian and Salehi were repeatedly subjected to psychological and physical abuse during lengthy interrogations, the suit says. Their captors at turns threatened to dismember or execute them. Interrogated in isolation and often deprived of sleep, each also was warned that the other might be maimed or executed, and that the same fate could befall other family members in Iran, according to the filing.The ordeal was so intense that Rezaian, Salehi and Rezaian’s brother, Ali, all contemplated suicide, the suit says. Now — almost nine months after Rezaian and four other U.S. citizens were released on the day the nuclear deal was implemented — Salehi, the Rezaian brothers and their mother are still afflicted with trauma and guilt, according to the suit.“For 544 days, Jason suffered such physical mistreatment and severe psychological abuse in Evin Prison that he will never be the same,” the suit states. “He will require specialized medical and other treatment for the rest of his life.”Salehi is not a plaintiff in the suit. Nor is The Washington Post. Rezaian is on leave from The Post for a year as a Nieman fellow at Harvard University.“Iran’s unconscionable actions have inflicted deep and lasting wounds on The Washington Post’s Jason Rezaian and his family,” said Executive Editor Martin Baron, who during the reporter’s imprisonment often criticized what he called Iran’s “system of injustice.”“This legal filing is a stark telling of Iran’s brutal and heartless treatment of an innocent journalist and his wife, and the impact on those who love him. While this legal action is being taken solely by Jason and his family, The Post continues to support the Rezaians through their long and painful recovery.’’The Rezaian lawsuit is the latest attempt by Americans to have the U.S. justice system provide compensation for harms inflicted by the Iranian government — in particular, by the powerful and hard-line Revolutionary Guard Corps, which fiercely opposed the nuclear deal and has tried to thwart many initiatives of President Hassan Rouhani, a relative pragmatist. The corps is named as a co-defendant in the suit.“This was really one of the few ways they felt they could try to hold Iran publicly accountable,” said David Bowker, Rezaian’s attorney. “Ideally, it will deter this kind of behavior toward other innocent people.”Rezaian and his family declined to discuss the case, referring questions to their lawyer. The Iranian mission to the United Nations did not reply to an email requesting comment.In a number of suits brought against it over the years, Iran has not responded, resulting in default judgments.Congress and U.S. courts have provided a legal framework for Americans to sue Iran and be compensated. The State Department has labeled Iran the top state sponsor of terrorism in the world. Sudan and Syria are also on the list.In April, the Supreme Court upheld a law allowing American victims of terrorism and their families to collect almost $2 billion in seized Iranian assets. The case involved relatives of people killed or injured in the 1983 bombing of the U.S. Marine Corps barracks in Beirut. Iran labeled the decision “confiscation” and “theft.”The closest precedent to Rezaian’s case involves Nik Moradi, an Iranian American who was seized during a family visit in 2007 and accused of spying for the United States. More than six months before his release on bail, he said, he was subjected to physical and mental torture during interrogations. In 2013, Moradi and his wife sued Iran in U.S. federal court under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act. The couple was awarded $20 million in a default judgment after Iran failed to respond.One possible venue for securing payment on a judgment is the Victims of State Sponsored Terrorism Fund, created last year by Congress to compensate the Americans held hostage in Iran during the takeover of the U.S. Embassy in Tehran after the 1979 revolution. It also set aside money for victims with court judgments against state sponsors of terrorism, funded by money from a civil penalty paid by BNP Paribas bank for violating sanctions against Iran, Cuba and Sudan.The lawsuit provides dark glimpses of Rezaian’s 50 days in solitary confinement in a small, dank, cockroach-infested cell. Anxiety and depression made him hallucinate, as he perceived the walls moving and talking. The cell was constantly lighted, and a noisy fan hindered his sleep. Rezaian slept on the floor, and prison officials eventually gave him tranquilizers to induce sleep. His food sometimes had concrete, rocks, dirt and other inedible objects mixed in.“During his time in solitary confinement, Jason believed he was losing his mind,” the suit says.In the initial months of his imprisonment, Rezaian was taken blindfolded several times a day to an underground room for interrogations that lasted hours. He was forced to write down his answers, which prison officials translated into Farsi before trying to coerce him to sign without explaining the translations.In an effort to get Rezaian to confess to espionage, the suit says, one interrogator threatened him with beheading. Another held out the carrot of a video confession as his only chance for freedom.“They threatened Jason with physical mutilation, such as cutting off his limbs, and repeatedly told Jason that he would never see Yeganeh alive again,” the suit says.Though Salehi is not a plaintiff, her agony is clear in the suit’s dry legalese.During her detention, Salehi was blindfolded as interrogators hit t",815

Witness said some tried to scale a wall near the river. Others were pushed forward. Dozens were trampled as friends and relatives cried out.“It was a frightening situation, with women and children crying for help,” pilgrim V. Satyanarayana told the Associated Press. “The policemen on duty were helpless and it took more than an hour to bring the situation under control.”Police tried to break through, pulling people out by an arm or an ankle. When the crowd died down, at least 27 people were left dead and more than 60 injured.A sea of mismatched sandals were left behind.The Pushkaram festivals occur annually, rotating each year among India’s 12 sacred rivers. The Godavari Maha Pushkaram, however, occurs only once every 144 years.“There is a false belief that taking a holy dip in the river on the first day of the festival will be more auspicious,” Swamy Swaroopanand, a Hindu holy man, told the Associated Press. “It’s the same as taking dip on any other day.”Officials told the Hindustan Times the small city of Rajahmundry was not equipped to handle it. Witnesses told the Times of India there were no clear exit or entry points to the river, which confused the crowd, and amid the chaos, police were not able to clear roads for ambulances waiting nearby.Such stampedes, particularly at places of pilgrimage, have plagued India for years, so much so that despite the vast number of lives they claim, they receive little notice outside the country.As the thousands of faithful stream in through narrow passages to the water, they often find themselves on slippery and uneven slopes and crumbling stairways, called “ghats,” which can become treacherous when panic ensues. Since many are in rural areas, anything amounting to crowd control is sparse or nonexistent. Those who have witnessed these tragedies come away horrified.Still, the incidents are no deterrent to those whose religious fervor and traditions beckon.More than 1,000 people have been killed in stampedes during the past decade, the worst of which came in 2005 when nearly 350 people were killed and more than 200 were injured at a religious festival at Mandher Devi temple in western Maharashtra, according to India Today.Masses were also killed in stampedes near temples in 2006 and 2008. In 2011, more than 100 were killed at a religious festival in Kerala.In 2013, more than 110 were killed in Madhya Pradesh when it was thought that a bridge crowded with people was about to collapse.“The higher tolerance for crowded spaces in India allows for people to get closer, because they don’t feel uncomfortable until it is very packed,” Teresa Moore with the International Centre for Crowd Management and Security Studies in the U.K. told the Wall Street Journal in 2013.Such crowds often grow too large, too fast, Moore said.“People panic and react,” she said. “Couple that with a rumor, which can come out of that feeling of panic, that’s when you can get a surge or a problem.”Part of the problem, researchers say, is that India’s largest religious festivals are often held in rural areas that don’t have the infrastructure to handle them.A 2013 study in the International Journal of Disaster Risk Reduction found that religious gatherings and pilgrimages account for 79 percent of stampedes.“The triggers of human stampedes have been identified from case studies and it is concluded that a simple accident, an intentional act or even a rumor can trigger a crowd disturbance,” it said. “Safety and comfort of religious mass gatherings is primarily influenced by the vulnerability of the location and their accompanying characteristics,” it continued. “Religious festivals, especially when located at remote rural areas and on hilly terrains, and on the foothills or at riverbanks lacking proper pathways always pose a geographical risk to the pilgrims. Steep slopes, uneven topography of the venue, dead ends, slippery and muddy floors, narrow passages, convergence of pedestrian flow to a single point are among the common risks prevailing in religious gathering sites, compromising safety and triggering stampedes.“Devotees visiting the locations even during the late night to early morning lead to huge and prolonged mass gatherings at vulnerable locations.”Before Tuesday morning’s stampede, chief minister Chandrababu Naidu and his family bathed in the Godavari River as the crowd started to swell. When Naidu left, the barricades were removed and the people poured in.“After the CM left, all of a sudden they opened the gates without first trying to control the crowd,” witness V. Ramesh told the Times of India. “This set off the stampede.”Some were shoved down the steps into the river and drowned.After the incident, Naidu took to Twitter to reassure pilgrims.“It is regrettable that lives are lost in stampede at Rajahmundry Ghat. Request people not to panic. Situation brought under control,” he wrote. “I request to people to head to other Pushkar ghats to avoid overcrowding at single ghat. I’m monitoring situation from control room.”Naidu has since put out a statement asking pilgrims not to rush into a single ghat.“Please maintain restraint, follow queue lines and instructions, and head to other Pushkar Ghats when you see excess crowd at one place,” he said. “Pilgrims safety is of top priority to us. We will provide complete assistance.”An estimated 40 million people are expected to participate in the 12-day religious festival at different points along the river, according to organizers.",626

Aliyu, a research fellow in vaccine evaluation at the University of Manitoba in Canada, and his colleagues launched a pilot program in 2008 in Gezawa, an area near Kano, northern Nigeria’s largest city, where there was strong opposition to polio vaccination.Working with a government health agency, they used mobile roadside film shows to educate the community about the risks of polio and show testimonies from caretakers of polio sufferers and those affected by the disease. And they directly involved local Muslim leaders called imams, who had been distrustful of the vaccination programs, to mobilize the communities.“This is the society I belong to, and I know how seriously they take the message from the Friday prayers. I believe they will take the advice of the imam most seriously,” said Aliyu, lead author of the report published Tuesday in PLOS Medicine.In six months of the pilot program, the number of immunized children younger than 5 went from 2,755 to 11,364.Aliyu said that when he was growing up in Jigawa state in northern Nigeria, he saw many children affected by polio, a crippling and potentially fatal disease. He believed, like many, that it was caused by a bad spirit.“The local community believed the disease was spread by a demon spirit and if you were unlucky you might come across it and it would strike you, and your limb would be paralyzed,” he said in a telephone interview. “We didn’t know this is something infectious, something you can get from the environment.”At medical school in Zaria, another northern state, he learned about polio and realized the bad curse was in fact a disease that could be protected against.In 1988, polio was endemic in 125 countries, according to UNICEF. Since then, through aggressive vaccination programs, the virus has been almost eradicated in most countries, with the notable exceptions of Pakistan, Afghanistan and Nigeria.Until two or three years ago, Nigeria, and particularly Kano in the predominantly Muslim north of Africa’s most populous country, was the epicenter of global polio infections, according to UNICEF.Opposition to the vaccine by some local scientists and rumors that the vaccines caused sterility and were a covert attempt to reduce the Muslim population in the north added to resistance. Incidents such as when a small number of vaccine-induced infections in 2006 led to outbreaks bolstered these fears.A milestone for the program was when it gained the support of the Sultan of Sokoto, a spiritual leader in Nigeria, who helped launch the Northern Traditional Leaders Committee for Primary Health Care and Polio Eradication in 2009.In 2010, a team of experts consisting mainly of Nigerian Muslim scientists was formed to assist the committee, which included four of the authors of the new report. The team mapped the high-risk areas in the north within the 12 polio-prevalent states and set up the Northern Religious Leaders Contact Group, assisted by the sharia boards and ministries for religious affairs.The program has since provided training for about 18,000 Muslim imams, through 10 weekly sessions, educating them on the facts about polio, providing a platform for discussion, answering questions and concerns, and arming them with advice they can share with their communities.Imams were given template sermons about polio and the importance of vaccination that they could use during Friday prayers and daily discussions.“The missing link with campaigns in the past was that we didn’t figure out how to connect with the society,” Aliyu said. “From now on, we will maximize the use of traditional and religious leaders as part of the campaign.”When the committee of imams was launched in 2009, there were 384 new wild poliovirus cases reported in Nigeria, most in the northern states. By 2010, the number of reported cases had plummeted to 21.In 2011, however, there were 62 cases in the northern states, and 118 in 2012. Last year the number of cases dropped to 49.According to UNICEF, there have been five cases so far in 2014, three of which were in Kano state.“We’re seeing exciting news in Nigeria,” said Sarah Crowe, chief of crisis communications at UNICEF. “It’s the next big hope.”Read: Virus sleuths, public health officials track mysterious polio-like virus",801

But milder strains of marijuana, even when used heavily, don't appear to carry any increased risk of psychosis.Those are the headline findings of an important new study published in the journal Lancet Psychiatry yesterday. Researchers obtained data from 410 South London patients sent to the hospital for a first-episode psychotic incident (meaning they hadn't been previously diagnosed with disorder), and compared it to data from 370 control individuals living in the same area.Compared with someone who had never smoked, a weekly user of high-potency weed (defined here as having greater than 15 percent THC content) was about three times as likely to be diagnosed with a psychotic disorder. For daily users, the risk increased to five times.On the other hand, the researchers found no link between frequent use of low-potency weed (< 5 percent THC content) and psychotic disorder.In studies like this one, it's important to remember that correlation doesn't indicate causation. ""The authors clearly point out that they cannot be sure the association seen in their study is causal,"" writes Suzi Gage, a University of Bristol researcher who studies the link between marijuana use and psychosis, in The Guardian newspaper. ""The people who choose to smoke cannabis might be different in a variety of other ways, which could be the cause of the increase in psychosis risk. Although you can control for these in analyses, you can never be sure you’ve adequately adjusted for them.""Still, the different findings for smokers of low- and high-potency weed are significant, and worth digging into -- especially considering that most of the marijuana consumed in the U.S. today is of the high-octane variety.As the chart shows, the average strength of weed seized by federal authorities has steadily risen over time. Retail outlets in Denver and elsewhere advertise strains that contain 25 percent THC or more. As legalization opponents are forever fond of saying, this isn't your daddy's weed.Just as you'd expect a daily pint of vodka to take a greater toll on your health than a daily pint of beer, it seems reasonable to posit that frequent use of high-octane weed will have different health consequences than a daily toke of the milder stuff. But due at least partially to the economic incentives imposed by cannabis prohibition, low-potency weed is typically harder to come by these days.Today's illicit weed has a lot in common with prohibition-era moonshine. To maximize profits while avoiding detection, many of today's pot growers maintain a singular focus on boosting THC content to the exclusion of all other considerations. The weed they produce is generally good for getting you very high, but little else. The absence of a regulatory framework -- particularly labeling requirements that let you know what you're smoking -- means that buying weed on the black market today is akin to buying a bottle of booze without knowing whether it contains beer or vodka.And chemically speaking, marijuana is a more complicated substance than alcohol. The high of a given strain of bud is determined not just by THC, but by the interaction of dozens of chemical compounds in the plant that researchers are only just now beginning to understand. One of those compounds, cannabidiol or CBD, is actually known to have anti-psychotic effects, and it eases the paranoia that sometimes comes with getting really, really high. CBD and THC are present in roughly equal quantities in low-potency weed, but in the high-octane stuff CBD is essentially non-existent. This is likely one reason why the Lancet study found higher odds of psychosis among users who liked their weed strong.As prohibition eases and legal markets open up, growers now have the breathing room to select for traits beyond high THC content. Demand from new users looking to experience a social high, rather than four hours of couch lock, will likely drive this. The end result may be a resurgence of milder strains of weed that are more akin to fine wines than to bathtub gin. From a mental health standpoint, they'll be safer too.",813

That iconic image is based on a photograph by Alberto “Korda” Diaz Gutierrez; we have more on the history of the image here.Guevara was a leader in the Castro brothers’ revolution to overthrow the Batista dictatorship in Cuba and replace it with a communist government. As the Huffington Post noted: “Cuban-Americans generally revile him for his role in establishing the island’s Communist dictatorship.”In his remarks, Gross made it clear that he did not blame the Cuban people for his imprisonment:“In no way are they responsible for the ordeal to which my family and I have been subjected,” Gross said. “To me, Cubanos — or at least, most of them — are incredibly kind, generous and talented. It pains me to see them treated so unjustly as a consequence of two governments’ mutually belligerent policies.”",817

Sun,1474430756000,The Washington Post,To Your Health,"A new form of a dangerous “superbug” may be spreading to humans through contaminated poultry that people handle or eat, according to a study published Wednesday.Researchers focused on a newly identified strain of the bacterium known as MRSA, or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, that they found in people in Denmark. Although most individuals who become infected with MRSA don’t get it from food, the study suggests that this poultry-associated strain may be more easily transmitted from food to people.The findings underscore the importance of reducing the use of antibiotics in food-producing animals to boost their growth, the researchers say. The issue is expected to be discussed prominently at an unusual meeting at the United Nations on Wednesday. The high-level summit is focused on the rising threat posed by superbugs, microbes that can’t be stopped with drugs. It is only the fourth time that the world’s decision-makers have addressed a health concern at the U.N. General Assembly.MRSA, which is resistant to several antibiotics, is commonly found in locker rooms, hospitals, military barracks and other settings where large numbers of people congregate. The bacteria can cause serious infections, including pneumonia and bloodstream infections that can cause life-threatening sepsis.Until now, researchers have known that livestock can carry the bacteria, putting farmers, farmworkers, veterinarians and others who work directly with animals at greater risk. MRSA bacteria have also been shown to be present in foods, including pork, beef and dairy, although outbreaks from food contamination have been rare.“This shows that everyday consumers — the general public — are also potentially at risk,” said Lance Price, a member of the research team and director of the Antibiotic Resistance Action Center at George Washington University.As part of the study, published in the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases, U.S. and Danish researchers utilized a national, multiyear MRSA database at the Statens Serum Institut in Copenhagen. They identified 10 people in urban areas who had carried or been infected with this new strain. None had worked on farms or had direct exposure to food animals. Regardless, no Danish livestock showed evidence of this particular type of bacteria.Using genetic analysis to compare the strain found in the 10 study subjects and those found in people, livestock and food products from other European countries, the researchers were able to trace the bacteria to poultry imported from those other countries, including France, Germany, Italy and the Netherlands.Samples of the strain in the Danes were virtually identical, a finding that suggests all of the individuals were exposed from a common source, most likely contaminated chicken or turkey.“Our findings implicate poultry meat as a source for these infections,” said Robert Skov, a researcher at the Copenhagen institute.In the United States and other countries, officials monitor the food supply for intestinal bacteria such as E. coli, salmonella and campylobacter. But staph bacteria, including MRSA, are not included.Although food is still a relatively minor source of MRSA transmission, Price said the research shows the superbug is changing and evolving in real time.“The more we treat huge gobs of animals with antibiotics and huge gobs of humans with antibiotics,” he said, the greater the likelihood that relatively rare types of transmission will become more common.Read more:Newest superbug found in a Connecticut toddlerMajor global partnership launched to speed antibiotic developmentBehind the scenes of a superbug discovery that made headlines around the worldA deadly, drug-resistant yeast infection is spreading around the world",823

Increases were particularly notable in Russia, Nepal, Bhutan and India, which is home to the world’s largest wild tiger population.WWF attributed the rise to better surveys, which are carried out by tiger-range countries and the International Union for Conservation of Nature, as well as enhanced protection efforts in the six years since those nations pledged to double the population by 2022.“We’ve watched tigers decline for decades and have dreamed of bending that curve in the other direction,” said Carter Roberts, president and CEO of World Wildlife Fund (WWF). “This is a big deal.”There are some caveats, of course. The current tiger population is bigger than it was six years ago, but it’s miniscule compared to the 100,000 believed to have lived in Asia in 1900, and it’s still smaller than the estimated 5,000 to 10,000 captive tigers that call the United States home.Surveys remain poor in some countries, such as Malaysia. Last week, Cambodia announced that tigers were now extinct within its borders. And tigers are still prized, and killed, for the supposed medicinal value of their body parts.“Every part of the tiger — from whisker to tail — is traded in illegal wildlife markets, feeding a multibillion-dollar criminal network,” WWF said in a statement.But at the rate of growth over the past six years, the goal of doubling the population by 2022 — the next Chinese year of the tiger — appears within reach.Ginette Hemley, senior vice president of wildlife conservation at WWF, told Scientific American that the goal “is going to be a challenge” and may take longer than planned. “I think it’s doable,” she said, “but it’s not going to happen without big mobilizations of additional resources and commitments.”Read more:One man’s wild idea for saving rhinos: Airlifting them to AustraliaRare Sumatran rhino, once believed to be extinct, dies just weeks after being discoveredTiger farms stoke Chinese demand for tiger wine and rugs, putting wild cats in peril",347

Not so for Julie Brill, a commissioner at the Federal Trade Commission who really wants you to know about the time she fell for an email phishing scam.""These are not the prince-from-Nigeria types of attacks of the past that we're used to,"" Brill said in a recent interview. ""These are deeply sophisticated.""Phishing scams can affect anyone — even, as it turns out, high-ranking federal officials whose whole jobs revolve around regulating corporate data security practices. The irony isn't lost on Brill, who is trying to turn her personal story into an object lesson for consumers like you and me.As Brill tells it, the saga began earlier this year. A business contact of hers — Gene Kimmelman, president of the consumer group Public Knowledge — sent her an email with an innocuous-looking Google Drive attachment. But after clicking on the link and entering in some of her personal information on the resulting page, she soon realized the truth: This was not a Google site at all.Instead, online criminals had muscled their way into Kimmelman's email account and begun sending fake emails in his name to everyone in the account's address book. (I, too, got a fraudulent email from Kimmelman's attackers.)""I was busy, I saw an email from this person, I opened it, tried to interface with it,"" said Brill. ""And I pretty soon realized this was a false email from [someone] who was trying to get my data.""Luckily, even though Brill had given out some of that data, she had made sure that the criminals wouldn't be able to hijack her own accounts. She'd taken advantage of two-factor authentication, a security measure that prevents someone from logging into a website unless they can also reproduce a special code sent to a separate device such as your mobile phone. Two-factor or two-step verification has been adopted by Google, Amazon and other major websites to combat the rise of digital fraud.The loss of information took place on Brill's personal computer, so nothing in the FTC's systems was affected, she said. But she did consult with the agency's IT managers.""Once they found out I had two-factor authentication and I had changed some passwords, they were comforted that I had done all that I could do,"" said Brill. ""If it had been an attack on our systems, they would have jumped into high gear right away.""So how did the hackers break into Kimmelman's address book in the first place? That mystery may never be solved.""It was either a random hack, or someone … knew those on my contact list would expect me to have secret documents to share,"" Kimmelman joked in an email. ""If not a random hack, my reputation may be ruined!""Kimmelman has since switched email accounts.Brill is leaving the FTC at the end of the month to enter the private sector — a decision that was unrelated to this incident. But her imminent departure makes this an opportune time to highlight the risks of not having two-factor authentication enabled for your sensitive online accounts.""I say to groups, 'How many of you have two-factor authentication?' and I don't see enough hands,"" said Brill. ""So I say to folks, 'If you get nothing else out of this talk, please go home and turn on two-factor authentication.' """,821

The majority of the world’s 80 million Anglicans reside in Africa, where many vehemently oppose the idea.In concessions to opponents with theological objections, the package of measures passed Monday allows a parish unsatisfied with a female bishop to ask for a male alternative and take its complaints to an independent body.“You don’t chuck out family or even make it difficult for them to be at home,” Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby said in reference to the traditionalists during a lively, five-hour debate that preceded the vote.When Welby was confirmed to his post last year, he inherited a church still reeling from a crisis sparked in 2012 after a similar proposal to ordain women as bishops was rejected by six votes. At the time, an influential group of lawmakers called for the government to intervene and revoke the church’s exemption from equality legislation.The church approved the ordination of female priests 22 years ago, but they were barred from becoming bishops because of opposition from male clergy. Today, women make up about one-third of all church clergy but are less likely than their male counterparts to receive a stipend for their work.During the gathering Monday, a message was read out from Desmond Tutu, the retired archbishop of South Africa, where women already serve as bishops. “Wow, you are in for a great surprise and a treat,” he wrote. “Yippee!”",445
cad56e871cd0bca6cc77e97ffe246258,https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/05/11/the-middle-class-is-shrinking-just-about-eve,The middle class is shrinking just about everywhere in America,Emily Badger; Christopher Ingraham,1463000829000,The Washington Post,Wonkblog,"The great shrinking of the middle class that has captured the attention of the nation is not only playing out in troubled regions like the Rust Belt, Appalachia and the Deep South, but in just about every metropolitan area in America, according to a major new analysis by the Pew Research Center.Pew reported in December that a clear majority of American adults no longer live in the middle class, a demographic reality shaped by decades of widening inequality, declining industry and the erosion of financial stability and family-wage jobs. But while much of the attention has focused on communities hardest hit by economic declines, the new Pew data, based on metro-level income data since 2000, show that middle-class stagnation is a far broader phenomenon.The share of adults living in middle-income households has also dwindled in Washington, New York, San Francisco, Atlanta and Denver. It's fallen in smaller Midwestern metros where the middle class has long made up an overwhelming majority of the population. It's withering in coastal tech hubs, in military towns, in college communities, in Sun Belt cities.The decline of the American middle class is ""a pervasive local phenomenon,"" according to Pew, which analyzed census and American Community Survey data in 229 metros across the country, encompassing about three-quarters of the U.S. population. In 203 of those metros, the share of adults in middle-income households fell from 2000 to 2014.Pew defines middle-income households here as those making between two-thirds and twice the national median household income. For a three-person household in 2014, that means an income between about $42,000 and $125,000. The fact that median incomes have declined over this same time frame also means that the bar to get into the middle class is actually lower now than it was in 2000. Pew's metro-level data are also adjusted for household size and local cost of living.The shrinking middle class is in part a reflection of rising income inequality in America, and of the same underlying and uneven economic forces that have fueled the rise of Donald Trump. And as the middle class has been shrinking, median incomes have fallen, too. In 190 of these 229 metros, the median income dropped over this same time.As the middle class has shrunk, Pew points out, the lower and upper classes in America have grown in size and significance. In some metros, the middle class is dwindling primarily because families are falling out of it and into the lower class. The share of households in this bottom tier has skyrocketed since 2000, for instance, in Goldbsoro, North Carolina, a railroad junction with an Air Force base.But in other places, the shrinking middle class is actually a sign of economic gains, as more people who were once middle class have joined the ranks at the top. This has been the case in booming energy hubs like Midland, Texas.In the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area, the share of adults living in lower-income households has actually held steady over this time. The households disappearing from the middle-class, rather, are reflected in the growing numbers at the top (this does not mean, though, that the same middle-class families are necessarily becoming wealthier; changes in the population makeup of the region may also reflect who moves away from the area and who migrates in).In total, 172 of these 229 metros saw a growing share of households in the upper-income tier. About as many — 160 — saw a growing share at the bottom. And 108 experienced both: The middle class shrank as the ranks of both the poor and the rich grew.The places with greatest net economic losses — where the shrinking middle-class has meant a sizable influx of households among the poor — are metro areas that have historically relied heavily on manufacturing, like Detroit, Fort Wayne, Ind., and Springfield, Ohio.In only about a quarter of all of these metros does the middle class make up less than a majority of the adult population today. But the largest metros in the country fall into this group, including New York, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Boston and Washington. In each of these metros, the middle class is relatively small because the upper-class share of the population is larger than average.These same metros also tend to have wider income inequality, reflecting the broad spectrum of jobs in industries from the low-paying service sector to finance and biotech. As a result, not surprisingly, Pew's data shows that metros with greater income inequality tend to have smaller middle classes. When the income distribution is narrower, on the other hand, more people are likely to be clustered in that middle tier between $42,000 and $125,000.",803

Is her school district responsible?",Yanan Wang,1463997262000,The Washington Post,Morning Mix,"Growing up, Emilie Olsen had an infectious smile, a love for horses and a perfect attendance record. She was a straight-A student and an excellent volleyball player. Emilie “had an extremely sweet spirit about her,” a family friend recalled.On Dec. 11, 2014, the 13-year-old shot and killed herself at home.It was a tragedy that sent a jolt through Fairfield, Ohio, where Emilie had lived since her parents, Marc and Cindy Olsen, adopted her from China when she was 9 months old. Classmates and neighbors mourned a young life cut short.But in the days following Emilie’s death, her parents spoke out against the seeming suddenness of it all. Emilie’s death was precipitated by cruel, relentless bullying, the Olsens said. Worse: It could have been prevented, they claimed, if officials at Fairfield Intermediate and Middle School had been more responsive. Emilie did not have to die, they said.These were the allegations made in an 82-page federal lawsuit the Olsens filed against Fairfield City School District, various administrators and Emilie’s alleged bullies last December. Since then, their fight to hold the school district accountable for their daughter’s death has been met with support from parents and denials from school officials.Former Fairfield City Schools superintendent Paul Otten, who is among the defendants named in the complaint, left his position last month to become the superintendent of the nearby Beavercreek City School District.Just last week, Fairfield Middle School Principal Lincoln Butts, also a defendant, resigned for “personal reasons.”Neither administrator gave specific explanations for leaving. In response to the lawsuit’s December filing, the school district said in a statement, according to WCPO: “The District will be defending the litigation and will be providing appropriate responses in the course of the litigation. The District has no further comment at this time regarding this pending matter.”Meanwhile, the lawsuit alleges that Emilie suffered discrimination because of her race and perceived sexual orientation and that school officials were negligent in their handling of her bullying. The complaint details a downward spiral brought on by unabating abuse.Escalating incidentsIt started in the fifth grade, according to the complaint, when Emilie took to wearing camouflage-patterned clothing and cowboy boots. Her style allegedly prompted jeers from classmates, who called her “fake country” — because “Chinese people don’t wear camo.”Things got worse when Emilie entered the sixth grade, the complaint said. She allegedly became the target of mean-spirited social media messages, as well as a fake Instagram account called “Emilie Olsen is Gay.” One classmate allegedly followed Emilie into the bathroom, handed her a razor and instructed her to “end her life.”Other Instagram accounts surfaced, making sexually explicit comments and derogatory remarks about Emilie’s perceived sexual orientation.In the gym one day, Emilie and another female student got into a scuffle over the fake accounts, and the student allegedly pushed Emilie and slapped her in the face. A teacher allegedly witnessed and broke up the fight but took no action other than to direct the students “back to class.”“I have a bad feeling that if nothing is done then this has the possibility to escalate into something worse,” Marc Olsen wrote in an email to the school’s assistant principals after learning of the fight from the father of a student who saw it happen. He then received a phone call from one of the principals, who allegedly said they were “going to take care of the situation.”According to the lawsuit, no students were ultimately disciplined for the fight or the Instagram accounts. Otten, the former superintendent, told WCPO last May that he didn’t know about the online bullying.“You’re assuming that when we get something (from parents) we start researching kids’ Instagram accounts and printing stuff off,” he said. “I wasn’t aware of it.”Otten added that he has four kids enrolled in the school district. “I can assure you,” he told WCPO, “… there is nothing for me to gain by hiding anything.”The bullying only intensified in seventh grade, the complaint said, when Emilie was placed in the same learning group as several girls who had allegedly harassed her the year before. By then, Emilie had started to inflict self-harm and express suicidal and depressive thoughts.When the Olsens brought these circumstances to the principals’ attention, they were allegedly told that Emilie “needed to buckle down” and cope even though she told an administrator she was “frightened to return to school.”While the cyber-bullying continued, physical messages allegedly started to appear on the stalls and walls of the school’s bathrooms. These scrawled scripts singled Emilie out by name — “Go kill yourself Emilie” — and made reference to Emilie’s race and perceived sexual orientation. According to the complaint, while the messages were in “easily observable” locations and “could not have been missed by anyone using the restrooms, including the school administrators” and teachers, the staff failed to remove them in a timely manner.In October 2014, a group of Emilie’s friends defended her against her bullies in the cafeteria, initiating a verbal dispute as her friends yelled at the bullies to stop “messing” with Emilie. (The students’ incident reports were obtained by WCPO.)At a previously scheduled meeting with the assistant principals the next day, Olsen was not told about the fight involving his daughter, the complaint alleges. In the following days, Emilie started vomiting and feeling unwell. When Olsen informed the school that she would be absent because she was feeling sick, he was allegedly still not told about the fight.Through all of this, Emilie was becoming increasingly withdrawn, barely recognizable from her old self, the complaint says. She seemed to take little interest in her schoolwork, and her grades dropped dramatically. On a personality quiz that Emilie was required to take for class, she described her “bad day symptoms” as “crying, depressing, yelling and screaming, passive resistance, and going into a trance,” the complaint says.Her Internet search history showed attempts to get help, followed by growing despair, her parents say in their lawsuit.Emilie asked strangers online whether they had ever been bullied and viewed articles about celebrities who were bullied in school. She visited a website with the line “I’m just a kid and my life is a nightmare,” and a picture of a young woman’s slashed forearm, with the caption “I’m not strong anymore.”At a school where Asian Americans were allegedly labeled “too smart” and mocked for their “slanted eyes,” Emilie seemed to feel alienated, the complaint says.She sought permission to dye her hair to “look more like a white person.” Her parents allege that she asked her father, “Why can’t I be white like you and mom?”Marc Olsen later told police that Emilie had been suffering from depression and had a history of cutting herself, the Butler County Journal-News reported.“I[‘m] causing all this trouble on earth,” Emilie wrote to a friend on Facebook on Dec. 1, 2014, the complaint says. “It hurts when you have to explain yourself to people you don’t know or like. You feel them judging you, staring at you, talking about you, and I’ve made up my mind, I wanna die.”She went on: “Even if there [sic] adults they hate me. I can’t please anyone with anything I do. Not even my teachers.”Less than two weeks later, Emilie killed herself with her father’s gun.A school’s roleFive days after the suicide, the Olsens were in the throes of grief when they allegedly received a visit from Principal Butts and a group of police officers. According to the lawsuit, the officers coerced the Olsens to let them inside their home, then told Marc Olsen that he was “stirring the pot” and “entertaining rumors” by talking to the media about Emilie’s death.At that point, Ols",812
defd7f4a85496d52a210938d58a7ae76,https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/she-the-people/wp/2014/08/22/do-the-benefits-of-a-college-educ,Do the benefits of a college education outweigh the cost?,Joann Weiner,1408705217000,The Washington Post,She The People,"It’s late August and thousands of teenagers are moving out of home to begin their college careers. While these freshmen are undoubtedly excited about starting this new adventure, as time passes, many of them might wonder whether the benefits of their college education will be worth the cost to obtain that education. Their parents who are footing a bill that may exceed a quarter of a million dollars by the time their child earns the prized college degree may also wonder whether those funds could have been better invested elsewhere.This kind of thinking may be particularly true for students who will borrow tens of thousands of dollars to pay for their bachelor’s degree and yet may find themselves four years later working at a Starbucks or driving a car for Uber.It’s also this kind of thinking that’s reflected in surveys like the one the Pew Research Center conducted a few years ago that reported a majority of Americans said that college wasn’t “worth it” because it didn’t “provide students with good value for the money they and their families spend,” and in the recent household survey by the Federal Reserve Board, where 37 percent of respondents said that the net financial benefit of their education was negative.Those are pretty sobering figures for a country where two out of three recent high school graduates are enrolled in college, up from just one in two graduates 30 years ago. Why are they going to college if it’s not worth it?This is a difficult question to ask, especially considering that President Obama has said that “Higher education is not a luxury. Earning a post-secondary degree or credential is a prerequisite for 21st century jobs, and one that everyone should be able to afford.”So, the question becomes, would students be more satisfied with their college education if it didn’t cost so much?Before answering that question, it’s worth looking in depth at how much it costs to attend college. That’s a hard question to answer because there are wide differences between the sticker price of a year in college — it averages about $40,000 a year at a four-year, private institution and $17,000 at a four-year public institution — and what a student actually pays out of pocket after taking into account financial aid, scholarships, and other tuition assistance programs. (The comparable figures covering just tuition and fees are about $29,000 at a private college and $8,000 at a public college, according to the National Center for Education Statistics.)Thus, answering the question about whether college is worth it from a financial point of view depends on knowing how much financial “help” a student receives from the college.By way of comparison, consider two private and two public four-year, degree granting universities. The first is George Washington University, where I teach economics, and the second is the University of California at Berkeley, where I earned my undergraduate degree. I’ve added Harvard University because that school is often used as a standard for many comparisons, and California State University at Los Angeles because it’s a low-cost public institution.The data come from the federal government’s College Affordability and Transparency Center, which shows the average net price a student pays per year at the particular college or university. The net price subtracts grants and scholarships, which are amounts that a student doesn’t have to pay back, from the total cost of attendance to obtain a figure that reflects a student’s actual costs. (The total cost includes room and board, books and supplies, and personal expenses.) The student will have to pay back any loans taken out to pay for the remaining expenses.According to the CATC, a typical GWU student will pay a net price of $31,443 a year after scholarships and grants. That student will borrow a total of $24,050 and make $276.77 payments each month for 10 years to repay the loan.A typical student at U.C.-Berkeley will pay $16,178 a year after scholarships and grants and have $16,028 in federal loans for a monthly payment of $184.45 over 10 years.For Harvard, a student will pay $14,445 a year after scholarships and grants and take out $11,000 in federal loans for a monthly payment of $126.59 over 10 years.Finally, a student at California State University-Los Angeles will pay $3,713 a year after scholarships and grants. That student will have the same amount of federal student loans as the Harvard student and, therefore, have the same monthly $126.59 payment.Four colleges, four net prices: $31,443, $16,178, $14,445, and $3,713. Which college provides the greatest net benefit?It’s hard to tell. But, what these figures do show is that looking at the sticker price doesn’t reflect the value of a college education.Moreover, even the net price doesn’t tell the whole story, since scholarships and grants aren’t the only things that reduce the cost of college.Students (or their parents) may also qualify for a host of education-based tax breaks, such as the American Opportunity and the Lifetime Learning Credit, and may set aside money in tax-favored education savings accounts, known as Section 529 plans and Coverdell Education Saving Accounts, that reduce the cost of saving for college. In many cases, interest paid on qualified student loans is tax deductible.Finally, the federal government offers several “income-driven” student loan repayment plans that limit the monthly payments to a certain amount of income in exchange for extending the loan repayment period and forgive any loan amount unpaid after that period. One plan recently cut the monthly payments from 15 percent to 10 percent of disposable income and reduced the repayment period to 20 years from 25 years. Most federal student loans qualify for one of these loan repayment plans.Despite these figures, some argue that these loan repayment programs represent “government bailouts” of college graduates, as Lindsey Burke wrote in “The Signal.” Others note that a college degree is no longer required to get a good job, especially since almost four of every ten college graduates are working at jobs that don’t require a college degree. Fruzsina Eordogh is one of those students who dropped out of college to work as a full-time writer for the Daily Dot (Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg, Microsoft’s Bill Gates, and Apple’s Steve Jobs are three of America’s most famous college dropouts.)But, just because the job doesn’t require a college degree doesn’t mean that a college degree isn’t a good investment. People with college degrees tend to keep their jobs during recessions and have a lower unemployment rate over time than those with just a high school degree. Most of the new post-recession jobs require a college degree. As the Pew Research Center found, the “big payoff” to a college degree isn’t so much in earnings but the ability to have and to keep a job.Finally, it’s important to look beyond financial compensation to measure the benefits of a college education. Studies show that people with more education are in better health, their children are in better health, and their marriages are more stable relative to people with less education.The point of these studies isn’t whether college provides a net financial benefit to the student, but whether college provides a net benefit overall.Here, the bottom line is positive. The Pew survey showed that the vast majority of graduates from a four-year institution say their college education helped them grow intellectually and to mature as a person. In other words, college may teach students as much about getting along with people as it does about analyzing Shakespeare’s sonnets.On that score, college provides a clear net benefit, not just for the student but for society as well.",690

The date was even marked on her calendar, but she was panicking at the prospect.Then she spotted rumors online that China was about to abandon its one-child policy after 35 years. It was, she says, “like a lifesaving straw.” For days, she sat nervously at home watching television, waiting for news.“When I heard the announcement about the new two-child policy, I cried,” she said. “My daughter came in and asked why I was crying, and I told her she was about to have a sister or a brother. She hugged me and cried with me.”Faced with looming workforce shortages and a rapidly aging population, China announced last month that all couples would be allowed to have two children.The one-child policy had extraordinarily far-reaching effects on Chinese society, and its relaxation marks a historic shift.The government says 90 million women, half of them in their 40s, will be affected by the change, once the National People’s Congress approves a new law next year.But it has left many women agonizing about choices they made and the choices ahead of them.This woman asked not to be identified by name because her story could still land her in trouble at work. A former supervisor had warned her not to become pregnant shortly after hiring her, but she had gone ahead and had a child anyway.Her current boss, she says, is more tolerant, but state-run companies have strict rules requiring them to fire employees who have a second child.Even in private companies, many women in China face workplace pressure not to get pregnant, according to women’s rights activists, creating potential tensions and tough decisions if they now decide they want a second child.“The difficulty for women in employment will increase, and gender discrimination probably will be worse,” Wang Pei’an, a spokesman for the National Health and Family Planning Commission, said at a news conference Tuesday, adding that the problem could be addressed through a “joint effort.”The stigma around larger families has been so strong that the 39-year-old woman said she had never even told her college classmates that she had a younger brother.Gradually, though, after her daughter was born, she began to envy couples who had two children. Her daughter, too, grew lonely and wanted a sibling.But the couple decided that they could not disobey the law.The woman began suspecting that she was pregnant shortly after taking a holiday trip with her husband in southern China last month.Finally, her husband bought her a pregnancy test. She didn’t even want to look at the result.“I was scared to face it, because I didn’t want to make a choice between my child and my job,” she said. When it was positive, she said, “it was horrible news, like a thunderbolt out of a clear sky.”And so began the agony of making a decision.She had grown up in a rural part of China, where boys were considered more important and girls usually quit their studies after high school. But she had worked hard, gone to college and secured a job she enjoyed at a state-owned company. She was proud, she said, to be an “economically independent woman.”Her husband suggested that she quit her job, offering to help her find another after the baby was born. But she was worried that he could also lose his job if his employer found out. Besides, she was in line for a promotion and knew it would be hard to find work after a break.An abortion seemed like her only option.“I couldn’t give it all up for an unborn baby,” she said. “I didn’t want to be a housewife for the rest of my life.”Gao Yushuang, another 39-year-old mother, has an 8-year-old girl. She had always wanted a second child, an urge so intense that she was ready to break the law. But eventually she decided that her family could not afford a fine of $15,000 to $30,000, on top of the cost of raising a second child. She decided to stick with one.When she heard on television that the policy was changing, her mother was on the phone even before the anchor had finished speaking.“She asked: ‘What are you waiting for? The policy has changed. You should respond to your country’s call.’?”But Gao was not so sure. For her, she said, it felt like the chance had passed.“If it had happened five years before, everything would have been different,” she said. “I would have been more energetic. My parents and in-laws would have been healthier, too. I definitely would have wanted a baby.”Internet searches for pregnancy-related products surged on China’s online shopping platforms after the news broke last week, state media reported.Demographer Lu Jiehua of Peking University warned that many of the women rushing to take advantage of the policy shift would be those born in the 1970s, potentially involving greater health risks for mothers and babies.For Gao, the balance had shifted. Her parents could become sick at any time, and she thought she lacked the energy to look after and educate another young child, she said.Then there was the stigma of being an older mother, and a fear that she would spoil the child.Gao said she didn’t go into all of this with her mother. To avoid an argument, she simply said she was too old to have another baby.The following day, she said, her phone was full of information about the change in government policy.“It was more stressful than ever,” she said. “Everyone was talking about having a second child. It felt like a time bomb. I felt I had betrayed my mother’s wishes. I was scared I might regret it one day.”So Gao sat down and wrote her future self a journal titled “Why I don’t want a second child.”“If one day my only child leaves me, and I am all alone, I will read the journal, and I will understand why I didn’t have a second child, and it will stop me suffering from regret,” she said.“My tears fell when I was writing. The feeling was complicated and bitter.”Xu Jing contributed to this report.Read more:The human suffering caused by China’s one-child policySee where women outnumber men in the world (and why)Today's coverage from Post correspondents around the world",814

They were amputated last week, according to a Facebook page set up to support Martinez and her family.Necrotizing fasciitis, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, is a serious bacterial skin infection that spreads quickly and kills the body’s soft tissue.Martinez was diagnosed with the terrifying disease after she was admitted to the emergency room on May 25 with severe pain in her left shoulder blade, according to the family.The next day, doctors were fighting to save her life.Three days after that, doctors were forced to remove dead tissue down the left side of her body.A GoFundMe campaign has raised more than $76,000 to assist the family with medical bills. Martinez’s husband, David, who met his wife in the Marines and currently works as a Gwinnet County police officer, has spent weeks by his wife’s side in the hospital, missing work.“Sure, she was a little scared,” David Martinez told People following his wife’s triple amputation, “but she was able to fight through that fear and say, ‘Enough is enough.’ ”Like many victims, Martinez was young and otherwise healthy when she became infected.Her husband called the source of the disease “a mystery.”“She didn’t have any injury, and initially at home when she was feeling the pain, I looked at where the pain was at and I didn’t notice anything, and that’s what’s troubling,” he told ABC affiliate WSB earlier this month.Ruth Berkelman, a professor of epidemiology at the Rollins School of Public Health at Emory University, told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution that it’s not unusual for patients to be unsure about how they contracted the infection. She said the entry point can be as forgettable as a minor cut or insect bite.“Usually when you talk with patients, if you ask them if they remember having a cut or something, they say ‘yes,’ but not always,” Berkelman told the AJC. “Maybe there was an insect bite or mild abrasion they didn’t pay attention to, but it does happen when people don’t remember anything.”It’s unclear exactly how many necrotizing fasciitis cases there are each year in the United States.According to the CDC, there are “about 650 to 850 cases” of necrotizing fasciitis caused by group A streptococcus each year. But, the CDC says, “this is likely an underestimation as some cases are probably not reported.”And the National Necrotizing Fasciitis Foundation notes that the CDC does not track cases caused by the other bacteria.But the foundation, a nonprofit founded by two survivors of the disease, say the group A Strep statistics combined “with the as yet unquantifiable numbers of people who contract NF from other forms of bacteria” are “frightening.”The disease works like this, according to the CDC:Bacteria spread rapidly once they enter the body. They infect flat layers of a membrane known as the fascia, connective bands of tissue that surround muscles, nerves, fat, and blood vessels. The infection also damages the tissues next to the fascia. Sometimes toxins made by these bacteria destroy the tissue they infect, causing it to die. When this happens, the infection is very serious and can result in loss of limbs or death.The speed at which necrotizing fasciitis attacks — often originating as simple soreness or swelling — takes many victims by surprise.Zach Motal’s case was no different.One day in May, Motal was strolling beside the surf in Fort Myers, Fla.The next day, he was lying on an operating table having the lower half of his right leg amputated.In between, his foot swelled up and turned purple, unleashing such excruciating pain on the 46-year-old that he showed up to the hospital in tears thinking it was broken, according to ABC News.“I figured they were going to put a cast on me and tell me to go home,” Motal told ABC. “I would never in a million years imagine I had a flesh-eating bacteria in me.”Through a small cut on his toe, Motal had contracted group A streptococcus, according to ABC. The bacterium, doctors explained to Motal, is the most common cause of necrotizing fasciitis.The flesh-eating infection is caused by multiple kinds of bacterium, including Vibrio vulnificus, which thrives in the Gulf of Mexico and other warm salty waters during the warmer months.Recent water tests in Fort Myers came back negative for Vibrio vulnificus and doctors have told Motal that he could have contracted group A streptococcus from “anywhere,” according to ABC. Motal, however, is convinced he came into contact with the bacteria during his walk along the beach.“The water had just splashed over my foot and I didn’t think anything about it,” he told NBC affiliate WBBH.Aside from being contracted via an open wound, Vibrio vulnificus can also be transmitted by eating raw shellfish, according to the Florida Department of Health.According to the Centers for Disease Control:An average of 50 culture-confirmed cases, 45 hospitalizations, and 16 deaths are reported each year from the Gulf Coast region (reporting states are Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas). Nationwide, there are as many as 95 cases (half of which are culture confirmed), 85 hospitalizations, and 35 deaths.Two years ago, CNN reported, “the Florida Department of Health reported 11 deaths and 41 infections. Texas reports 15 to 30 annual cases, while Maryland State officials say they see an average of 25 infections per year.”According to the CDC, Vibrio vulnificus infections prove fatal approximately 50 percent of the time. The infection — which can cause vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain and blistering skin lesions — usually kills victims within 24 to 48 hours as it spreads through the bloodstream and begins laying waste to precious tissue.With so little time to act, doctors are sometimes forced to diagnose patients without a blood test and by relying on experience, according to a 2010 Sun Sentinel story.“It’s really a surgical emergency,” Brian Brown, a physician assistant, told NBC affiliate WBBH. “They need to get in and do a fasciotomy and clean out the fascial plane and maybe even amputation.”Doctors had no choice but to amputate Motal’s leg. He told ABC the leg has 2,500 stitches and looks like a prop from a “horror movie.”A master carpenter and avid motorcycle rider, Motal told ABC he’ll have to find a new profession and hobby.Even so, he told ABC, it could have been worse.“The doctor said if I hadn’t have got here when I did, within four hours I would have been dead,” he said.He added: “I think something does need to be done. The public does need to be aware that there’s a flesh-eating bacteria.”MORE READING:Clinic worker might have been exposed to bioterror bacteria at Tulane research center, report saysFDA warns about medical scopes after ‘superbug’ bacteria hits UCLA hospitalThe mysterious 2 billion-year-old creature that would make Darwin smile",820

Critics called her case exploitation. Advocates argued she was making her mark. Maynard said she just wanted to leave a worthy legacy. And now that she’s gone, the trail she left behind may bring the physician-assisted suicide movement — and the deep divide about it — to a younger generation.Maynard, 29, died Saturday at her home in Portland, Ore., after taking lethal drugs prescribed by her physician. It was a decision she made earlier this year after being diagnosed with terminal brain cancer and given six months to live.Arthur Caplan, of New York University’s Division of Medical Ethics, wrote that because Maynard was “young, vivacious, attractive … and a very different kind of person” from the average patient seeking physician-assisted suicide, she “changes the optics of the debate.” In Oregon, the median age of someone who uses the state’s law to die is 71. Only six people younger than 34, like Maynard, have used it.“Now we have a young woman getting people in her generation interested in the issue,” Caplan wrote in article published on Medscape. “Critics are worried about her partly because she’s speaking to that new audience, and they know that the younger generation of America has shifted attitudes about gay marriage and the use of marijuana, and maybe they are going to have that same impact in pushing physician-assisted suicide forward.“She may change politics right here.”Her story commanded national attention. Before she died, she launched her own campaign with Compassion & Choices, an advocacy group for the terminally ill. She drew support from lawmakers in Connecticut and New Jersey.“I think [legislation] could get out of the Senate,” New Jersey Assemblyman John Burzichelli (D-Gloucester County) told the Philadelphia Inquirer. Burzichelli, the bill’s sponsor, thinks it will pass New Jersey’s state legislature this year.Even the women on “The View” debated her right to die. Big names like Rosie O’Donnell said to have “control over your own death, when you’ve had no control for so long over your illness, I think is the human thing to do.”But “assisted suicide” summons up deep religious and ethical concerns among some critics, including many Catholics and those associated with the Right to Life movement. While organizations have avoided criticizing Maynard, many have come out against the media and advocacy groups for what they consider exploitation of her story to gain a political edge. National Right to Life called Compassion & Choices “ghoulish” in its representation of Maynard’s tragedy.“While we would never criticize Maynard,” National Right to Life said on it Web site, “we are angry that Compassion & Choices would exploit her tragedy for its own malevolent purposes. Maynard’s case is what groups like Compassion & Choices live for, a beautiful young woman about to be cut down in the prime of her life. It matters not that such cases — authentically terminal illnesses — are always the opening wedge after which, once the principal is established, the ‘right’ to be ‘assisted’ expands to a whole panoply of reasons none of which are about terminal illnesses. Compassion & Choice’s agenda extends far beyond terminally ill 29-year-old women.”And even though Maynard’s story, which was documented in TV interviews and popular magazines, inspired a community of supporters, there were also social media efforts devoted to persuading her to choose a different course.Ira Byock, chief medical officer of the Institute for Human Caring of Providence Health and Services, spoke loudly against the practice.“When doctor-induced death becomes an accepted response to the suffering of dying people, logical extensions grease the slippery slope,” he wrote in a New York Times op-ed. He cited statistics in Holland, where the practice is permitted, that claim more than 40 people sought and received doctor-assisted death for depression and other mental disorders. “Even the psychiatrist who began this practice in the 90’s recently declared the situation had gone ‘off the rails.'”Byock added: “Moral outrage is appropriate and needed to fix the sorry state of dying in America. Legalizing assisted suicide fixes nothing. The principle that doctors must not kill patients stands.”In a poll conducted by the New England Journal of Medicine last year, 67 percent of more than 1,700 medical experts surveyed in the United States were against the physician-assisted suicide. That same year, a Pew Research survey showed public opinion was split, with 47 percent of U.S. adults supporting the practice and 49 percent opposing it. Then a Gallup poll that year suggested results varied according to how the question was presented: Some 70 percent of Americans were in favor of allowing physicians to “end the patient’s life by some painless means,” but only 51 percent were in support of allowing doctors to help a patient “commit suicide.”Compassion & Choices President Barbara Coombs Lee, who drafted Oregon’s Death With Dignity Act, argued with Byock on public television.“Hospice and palliative care is the gold standard,” she told Byock last month. “It’s wonderful. But it’s not a miracle. And it cannot prevent the kind of relentless, dehumanizing, horrific decline that Brittany faces, where her disease will cause unending seizures and headaches and nausea and vomiting and pressure in her brain, and the loss of every bodily function, including thinking and moving.”Coombs Lee added: “No palliative care, terminal sedation, or promise of effective palliative care can give Maynard the thing she treasures now … the hope of gaining control over her disease before it takes her life.”Late last month, Maynard took to her blog to address critics.“I made my decisions based on my wishes, clinical research, choices, discussions with physicians, and logic,” she wrote. “I am not depressed or suicidal or on a ‘slippery slope.’ I have been in charge of this choice, gaining control of a terrifying terminal disease through the application of my own humane logic.” Throughout the past month, she said that was the reason for her campaign — to fight for other terminally-ill patients in states without protections.Oregon, Vermont and Washington are currently the only three states that have death-with-dignity laws. Two other states, Montana and New Mexico, have court rulings that protect physicians who help patients die. Bills have been introduced in seven other states.But Caplan believes this is just the beginning.“Brittany Maynard may change this debate,” he wrote. “My forecast is that we are going to see more push to put these laws in the front of state legislatures and to get them on state ballots. We are going to see more states move in this direction. That intimately may be her legacy to the physician-assisted suicide debate.”RELATED: “Brittany Maynard, as promised, ends her life at 29”“Brittany Maynard may wait to end her life, but, like others, she knows the time will come”“Cancer patient Brittany Maynard, scheduled to die Saturday, checked last item on ‘bucket list’”“Cancer patient Brittany Maynard, 29, has scheduled her death for Nov. 1”",393
